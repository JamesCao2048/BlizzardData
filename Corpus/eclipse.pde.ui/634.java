 * Classes that implement this interface are contributed via the extension point
 * <code>org.eclipse.pde.ui.pluginContent</code>. The expectation is that
 * classes also extend JFace Wizard class.  This wizard must be used when plug-in
 * dependencies are to be specified via the Import-Package header of a manifest.mf.
 * The role of this wizard is to provide additional plug-in content after the
 * project and the critical plug-in project files have been created.
 * The wizard is nested in the overall 'New' wizard and can contribute one or
 * more pages that allow users to configure how this content will be generated.
 * A typical implementation of this interface would be a template wizard that
 * populates the plug-in project with content that can be useful right away
 * (for example, a view or an editor extension).
 * <p>
 * Due to the call order of the method <code>performFinish</code> in nested
 * wizards, classes that implement this interface should not place the code that
 * generates new content in the implementation of the abstract method
 * <code>Wizard.performFinish()</code>. Instead, they should simply return
 * <code>true</code> and have all the real code in <code>performFinish</code>
 * defined in this interface. This version of the method passes all the context
 * required for the content generation and is called AFTER the project and vital
 * plug-in files have been already created.
 *
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
