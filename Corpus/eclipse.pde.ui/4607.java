/**
 * Describes a location in a target that provides bundles and features. Abstracts
 * the storage and provisioning of bundles. May contain a combination of
 * executable and source bundles.
 * <p>
 * Clients are allowed to provide their own implementations. For the target definition
 * to be persisted correctly, clients must provide a factory through the
 * <code>org.eclipse.pde.core.targetLocations</code> extension point.
 * </p><p>
 * It is recommended that implementors override {@link Object#equals(Object)} to return
 * <code>true</code> if the content of two containers are equal.  This allows PDE
 * to determine if two different target definitions have equivalent content.
 * </p><p>
 * To display an implementation in the PDE UI, clients may do the following:
 * </p><p>
 * - Implement <code>ITargetLocationWizard</code> and contribute to the <code>org.eclipse.pde.ui.targetLocationProvisioners</code>
 * extension point.
 * </p><p>
 * - Have their target location adapt to <code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ILabelProvider</code>
 * to provide text and icon labels in the target definition wizard and editor.
 * </p><p>
 * - Have their target location adapt to <code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ITreeContentProvider</code>
 * to provide children items in the target definition wizard and editor. The children must adapt to
 * <code>ILabelProvider</code> to get text and icon labels in the tree.
 * </p><p>
 * - Have their target location adapt to <code>org.eclipse.pde.ui.target.ITargetLocationEditor</code>
 * to open an edit wizard when the edit button is pressed on the target definition wizard and editor.
 * </p><p>
 * - Have their target location adapt to <code>org.eclipse.pde.ui.target.ITargetLocationUpdater</code>
 * to run an update job on the location when the update button is pressed on the target definition
 * wizard and editor.
