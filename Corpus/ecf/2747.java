/**
 * Listener for handling file transfer events. Instances implementing this
 * interface or sub-interfaces will have their handleTransferEvent called
 * asynchronously when a given event is received. Implementers must be prepared
 * to have this method called asynchronously by an arbitrary thread.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note these methods will be called asynchronously when notifications of remote
 * changes are received by the provider implementation code. The provider is
 * free to call the methods below with an arbitrary thread, so the
 * implementation of these methods must be appropriately prepared.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the code implementing any of these methods must interact with
 * user interface code, then it should use code such as the following to execute
 * on the SWT UI thread:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 	Display.getDefault().asyncExec(new Runnable() {
 * 		public void run() {
 * 		... UI code here
 * 		}
 * 	});
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Further, the code in the implementations of these methods should <b>not block</b>
 * via I/O operations or blocking UI calls.
