58157 – RecycleRequiredException and missing AsyncListener.onTimeout call
Created attachment 32916 [details]
Servlet which starts asynchronous processing and intentionally waits for a timeout before dispatching to a static HTML file.
Overview:
When repeatedly polling an asynchronous servlet which (intentionally) times out, I occasionally see the following exception in the console:
Jul 20, 2015 8:58:45 AM org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter checkRecycled
INFO: Encountered a non-recycled request and recycled it forcedly.
org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter$RecycleRequiredException

at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
This coincides with a request not receiving any response.
The majority of times the servlet is called, the correct response is returned as expected once the request times out, however on occasion (sometimes within 1 min, sometimes not until 30 mins of successful requests have passed) I see this exception and AsyncListener.onTimeout() is never called to produce the response.
Steps to reproduce:
0) Configure Tomcat to use the NIO connector
1) Deploy the attached TimeoutServlet (note: add a static HTML page 'timeout.html' to the root of the web application to serve as the timeout response).
2) Using a tool of your choice (I used JMeter), repeatedly send a request to the servlet and wait for the timeout response before sending the next request.
Actual Results:
Eventually, one of the requests will receive no response and the above exception will be written to the console.
Expected Results:
Every request should receive the timeout response (timeout.html) after 1 second and no exception should appear in the console.
Additional Information:
Appears to be very similar to https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57011.
