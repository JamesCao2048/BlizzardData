42119 – request.getCharacterEncoding misparses charset=UTF-8; xyz=3
(This bug is also present in Coyote source 6.0.10.)
If there is an HTTP header
Content-Type: text/abc; charset=UTF-8; xyz=3
request.getCharacterEncoding() returns "UTF-8; xyz=3" but Tomcat 4.1.24 returns
"UTF-8".
In Tomcat 4.1.24, request.getCharacterEncoding uses parseCharacterEncoding
defined in
jakarta-tomcat-4.1.24-src/catalina/src/share/org/apache/catalina/util/RequestUtil.java
and it correctly handles the case of other Content-Type parameters.
In Tomcat 5.5.23, however, request.getCharacterEncoding uses
getCharsetFromContentType defined in
from
apache-tomcat-5.5.23-src/connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/http/ContentType.java
which does not search for a possible terminating semicolon in the charset, thus
erroneously including additional characters in the charset.
The code in 5.5.23 has a comment begins
// Basically return everything after ";charset="
Please consider using the code from 4.1.24
This problem showed up when Content-Type was multipart/mixed and a client
specified a charset parameter to Content-Type; however, it will occur in any
Content-Type where charset is specified and is not the last parameter.
