50927 – [patch] More specific error message for missing SSLCertificateFile
Created attachment 26767 [details]
Patch to check and report error
If using SSL with APR, a missing SSLCertificateFile attribute currently results in a somewhat cryptic message from the native code.
This patch checks whether the attribute is null before calling the native code, and reports a more specific error.
