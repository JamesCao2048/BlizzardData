51185 – Performance : DataSourceProxy#createPool should use more fine grained synchronisation
Hello,
I don't know if this is the right component.
My Enhancement concerns new Tomcat JDBC POOL.
Looking at code I think that DataSourceProxy#createPool should not be synchronized but use another private method that is synchronized and used only when creation is needed, something like that:
/**
* Sets up the connection pool, by creating a pooling driver.
* @return Driver
* @throws SQLException
*/
public ConnectionPool createPool() throws SQLException {
if (pool != null) {
return pool;
} else {
return pCreatePool();
}
}
/**
*
* @return
* @throws SQLException
*/
private synchronized ConnectionPool pCreatePool() throws SQLException {
if (pool != null) {
return pool;
} else {
pool = new ConnectionPool(poolProperties);
return pool;
}
}
Currently since createPool() is called for lots of getters we get this synchro IMPACT without really needing it.
