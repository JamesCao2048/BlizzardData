36923 – Deactivated EL expressions are not parsed for jsp expressions/scriptlets/etc
JavaServer Pages Specification 2.0, section JSP.3.3.2 says:
---
Since the syntactic pattern ${expr} was not reserved in the JSP specifications
before JSP 2.0, there may be situations where such a pattern appears but the
intention is not to activate EL expression evaluation but rather to pass through
the pattern verbatim.
To address this, the EL evaluation machinery can be
deactivated as indicated in this section.
[...]
The default mode for JSP pages in a Web Application delivered using a web.xml
using the Servlet 2.3 or earlier format is to ignore EL expressions; this
provides for backward compatibility.
---
However, even with deactivated EL expression evaluation, jsp code like:
<%@ page isELIgnored="true" %>${<%= "Hello, world!" %>}
will produce output like:
${<%= "Hello, world!" %>}
which is of course not backwards-compatible with Servlet 2.3 / JSP 1.2 container
(e.g., Tomcat 4.x), where the output would be:
${Hello, world!}
The ${...} syntax is widely used, and any pre-2.0 jsp pages having it would be
incompatible with Tomcat 5.x even though the standard tries to ensure the
compatibility.
