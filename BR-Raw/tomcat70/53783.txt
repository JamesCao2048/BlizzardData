53783 – Static resources and jsp files under WEB-INF/lib/*.jar!/META-INF/resources are not found
Created attachment 29283 [details]
Example
Hi,
According to Servlet Specification, Servlet container should serve static resources and jsp files, located in META-INF/resources in any jar file under WEB-INF/lib.
"
10.5  Directory Structure
A Web application exists as a structured hierarchy of directories.
The root of this hierarchy serves as the document root for files that are part of the application.
For example, for a Web application with the context path /catalog in a Web container, the index.html file at the base of the Web application hierarchy or in a JAR file inside WEB-INF/lib that includes the index.html under META-INF/resources directory can be served to satisfy a request from /catalog/index.html.
If an index.html is present both in the root context and in the META-INF/resources directory of a JAR file in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the application, then the file that is available in the root context MUST be used.
"
When requesting such static resource/jsp file, Tomcat returns 404 Not Found.
Example is attached.
Request:
http://localhost:8080/test-meta-inf-resources/test.jsp
http://localhost:8080/test-meta-inf-resources/meta_inf_resource.jsp
After investigating the issue I think that the problem is in the following code:
org.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig
protected void processResourceJARs(Set<WebXml> fragments) {
...
if (jar.entryExists("META-INF/resources/")) {
context.addResourceJarUrl(url);
...
}
When I list the entries in jar, I receive:
INFO: Deploying web application archive C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.29\webapps\test-met
a-inf-resources.war
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
META-INF/resources/meta_inf_resource.jsp
There is no entry "META-INF/resources/"
I would like to propose a patch (attached) with which the request URLs above are working as expected.
Best Regards
