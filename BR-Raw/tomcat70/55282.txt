55282 – JSF PhaseListeners are duplicated
Created attachment 30604 [details]
source code to reproduce the issue
If using jsf 2 project and add Phase Listeners there, they are created and added to the list of Phase Listeners twice which means on page load same Phase Listeners are executed twice.
This is happening only when com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener is defined in web.xml.
Without such declaration in web.xml jsf is initialized one time.
Such behaviour seems to happen on 7.0.42 version.
I was using 7.0.41 and didn't see such behaviour.
I didn't have a chance to check it again on 7.0.41 but checked on 7.0.6(because had it installed) and there everything was fine.
Such behaviour can be very critical for applications using jsf and Phase Listeners.
And Maybe not only Phase Listeners are duplicated(didn't look), because the problem here is that jsf is initialized twice and other things can get duplicated too.
Attaching eclipse project where you can check the bug on 7.0.42 and compare to other tomcat version.
In 7.0.42 there is duplicated message in console that Phase Listener is created.
