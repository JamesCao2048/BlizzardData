48517 – @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") - document and reduce scope
Created attachment 24826 [details]
Patch - see description
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked") is occasionally necessary to stop the compiler complaining unnecessarily.
The attached patch ensures that all the existing tags have comments explaining why they are OK - or necessary (because the API is not generic).
It also restricts the scope of the annotation so that it only applies to the specific warning.
The intention is to make code maintenance easier and safer.
