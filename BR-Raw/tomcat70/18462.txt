18462 – System.err gets overriden to output to System.out
I am using Eclipse to do my development and I am running tomcat 4.1.24 from
within eclipse.
One of the nice features of eclipse is that anything you
display with System.out comes out in blue and anything you send to System.err
is displayed in red.
However when tomcat is running Catalina overrides
System.err and makes it point to System.out.
This is very inconvinient because
its much harder to search for severe error messages in a list of millions of
trivial ones.
