53702 – Only the last url-pattern from jsp-property-group is processed
Created attachment 29215 [details]
Modified files from the ROOT webapp
According to XSDs (jsp_2_0.xsd, jsp_2_1.xsd, jsp_2_2.xsd), the "url-pattern" can occur more than once in the same "jsp-property-group".
[[[
<xsd:complexType name="jsp-property-groupType">
...
<xsd:element name="url-pattern"
type="javaee:url-patternType"
maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
]]]
There are three places where the "jsp-property-group" element is represented by an object in Tomcat:
a) in Jasper, o.a.jasper.compiler.JspConfig$JspPropertyGroup
b) in Catalina, o.a.catalina.deploy.JspPropertyGroup
c) in Servlet 3.0 API, javax.servlet.descriptor.JspPropertyGroupDescriptor (implemented by o.a.c.core.ApplicationJspPropertyGroupDescriptor)
The implementations in a) and c) are correct ones,  but in b) the collection of url patterns is mistakenly represented by a single value and setUrlPattern() method.
As the "setUrlPattern" method is called by digester (configured in o.a.c.startup.WebRuleSet), only the last url-pattern value survives.
The observable consequences of this issue:
===========================================
1.
Merged web.xml is reproduced and passed to Jasper incorrectly.
(Currently it is passed only when metadata-complete="false" or absent, as I noted in Re:r1371995 on dev@, which is a different issue but it hides the effect of this one).
2.
A known feature is that the paths mentioned in jsp-property-group are implicitly mapped to the JspServlet.
Due to this issue this mapping occurs only for the last url-pattern.
(in WebXml#configureContext())
To reproduce in current 7.0.x (7.0.29 is affected):
====================================================
1.
Unpack attached archive and put the files into the ROOT webapp.
The files are context.xml with <Context logEffectiveWebXml="true"/>
and web.xml without metadata-compete attribute and adding the following:
[[[
<jsp-config>
<jsp-property-group>
<url-pattern>*.foo</url-pattern>
<url-pattern>*.bar</url-pattern>
<is-xml>true</is-xml>
</jsp-property-group>
</jsp-config>
]]]
2.
Start Tomcat and look into the "catalina.`date`.log" file.
The merged web.xml should have been dumped there.
Look for the "jsp-property-group" element.
Actual result:
[[[
<jsp-config>
<jsp-property-group>
<url-pattern>*.bar</url-pattern>
<is-xml>true</is-xml>
</jsp-property-group>
</jsp-config>
]]]
Expected result: both *.foo and *.bar should be mentioned.
Tomcat 6 does not have this issue, because there is no such object in Catalina there.
The digester configured in WebRuleSet calls StandardContext.addJspMapping(..), which is additive.
