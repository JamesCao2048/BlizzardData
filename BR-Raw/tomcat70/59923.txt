59923 – The default value of validationInterval attribute is too long.
The validationInterval attribute is 30 seconds by default.
In case of DB reboots, trigger some problems.
For example, the following events will be considered.
1.
The connection is validated.
2.
DB reboots.
3.
getConnection() within 30 seconds.
4.
The connection isn't validated by testOnBorrow.
5.
Get the invalid connection.
And worse, the default value of fairQueue is true.
As a result, invalid connection is continued to use.
Therefore, I think the default value should be more short or "0(disable)".
