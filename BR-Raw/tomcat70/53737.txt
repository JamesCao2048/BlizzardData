53737 – Use ServletContext.getJspConfigDescriptor() in Jasper instead of XML-parsing of merged web.xml [PATCHES]
In Tomcat 7.0.29 in ContextConfig#webConfig() a merged web.xml file is serialized into String and is put as an attribute into ServletContext.
[[[
String mergedWebXml = webXml.toXml();
sContext.setAttribute(
org.apache.tomcat.util.scan.Constants.MERGED_WEB_XML,
mergedWebXml);
]]]
Then in JspConfig#processWebDotXml() of Jasper it is parsed again from XML into objects.
It would be better to access the necessary configuration through Servlet 3.0 API methods such as ServletContext.getJspConfigDescriptor().
