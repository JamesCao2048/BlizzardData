51557 – Newline during a http header field name obscures next value
Created attachment 27314 [details]
Patch to stop CR & LF in the header.
InternalInputBuffer allows newlines in http header field names.
As an example:
Foo: Val1
Bar: Val2
MISS
Hup: Val3
This will lead to a field name of 'MISSHup' and not 'Hup'.
Digging into the specs, I think this goes back to RFC 822 which states:
field-name  =  1*<any CHAR, excluding CTLs, SPACE, and ":">
and
CTL         =  <any ASCII control           ; (  0- 37,  0.- 31.)
character and DEL>          ; (    177,     127.)
I think this is saying that field-name should not contain CR or LF.
I've attached a patch that stops CR & LF.
Two improvements I could see, if there's agreement with this as a bug, are adding a unit test to TestInternalInputBuffer and changing the code so it disallows space and any other ctrl character in the field name.
