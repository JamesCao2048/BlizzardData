58508 – role_name in tomcat-users.xml : invalid character
Bonjour,
My tomcat server send exception about invalid characters with a role name "ubx:5485" ;
My first question is : why ? ;o)
and I would like find specifications about valid characters for a role name.
do you have some solution , because I used Ldap connection, and all my groups are this format "xx:yyy:zzz" .
Thanks a lot ,
Frederic (de Bordeaux : soleil et froid )
