55309 – Concurrent issue of TagPluginManager
Created attachment 30629 [details]
Patch on TagPluginManager
TagPluginManager is shared within ServletContext.
But it contains a variable "PageInfo pageInfo".
PageInfo should be aligned with specified page.
PageInfo is used for holding page information, such as "Import".
So when there are two pages are compiled in parallel.
It encounters concurrent issue.
 One of the page can't be compiled unless the server is restarted.
