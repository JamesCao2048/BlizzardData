39724 – Bug on StandardPipeline.removeValve(Valve valve) for T5.5.16+
I run into this problem with T5 when tring to add/remove/add a valve to the
standard engine.
-For what I understand an empty pipeline has:
basic = StandardEngineValve (For example);
first = null;
-If you add a valve you will get
basic = StandardEngineValve
first = myValve (with myValve.next = StandardEngineValve)
-If you remove the valve you will get
basic =StandardEngineValve
first = StandardEngineValve
Note that StandardEngineValve is in first too here.
-If I try to add a new valve given the actual code in  addValve the valve will
not be added because (see the **) current = basic and current.getNext() = null;
addValve(Valve valve) {
// Add this Valve to the set associated with this Pipeline
if (first == null) {
first = valve;
valve.setNext(basic);
} else {
Valve current = first;
while (current != null) {
**                if (current.getNext() == basic) {
current.setNext(valve);
valve.setNext(basic);
break;
}
current = current.getNext();
}
}
}
