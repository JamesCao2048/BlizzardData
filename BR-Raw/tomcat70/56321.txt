56321 – ServletContextListener.contextDestroyed not completely executed when updating war
When the contextDestroyed accesses a static method on a class which has not been loaded yet, the rest of the contextDestroyed code is not executed,e.g.,:
package contexttest;
import javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent;
import javax.servlet.ServletContextListener;
public class ContextTest implements ServletContextListener {
public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent arg0) {
System.out.println("Context Destroyed");
MyTest.testStatic();
System.out.println("Context Destroyed Done");
}
public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent arg0) {
System.out.println("Context Initialized");
}
}
package contexttest;
public class MyTest {
public static void testStatic(){
System.out.println("My static method call");
}
}
When I created a war based on this code, and copy this war to the tomcat web apps directory, it logs 'Context Initialized' as expected.
When I remove the war it logs:
Context Destroyed
My static method call
Context Destroyed Done
as expected.
However when I copy the war to web apps, wait till it is initialized, and then touch the war (to simulate the update of a the war).
It logs for the destroy event only:
'Context Destroyed'
So the static method call and the 'Context Destroyed Done' is missing.
When I execute the above on tomcat 7.0.42 it behaves as I would expect, so no difference between removing a war or updating the war.
