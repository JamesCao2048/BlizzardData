40929 – Misleading comments in StandardClassLoader
Sometime during the Tomcat 5 development, the StandardClassLoader in
org.apache.catalina.loader package was stripped down, and is now just a
URLClassLoader.
I work with code that extends the StandardClassLoader (we use the automatic
reloading of jar files), and during an upgrade from tomcat 4 to tomcat 5.5 found
difficultly trying to figure out what had happened to the code.
 I ended up
having to install SVN and do a svn log to figure out why the code was removed.
When the code was stripped down, the comments in the java file (and therefore in
the javadoc api) remained identical, so the javadoc api for the class is very
misleading.
 For instance, the comments say that the class implements Reloader,
when it in fact does not.
The class comments should be updated to reflect the state of the code.
I can't see this as being very high priority, but it would likely be an easy to
fix for people whom are in the code regularly, and it would make the javadoc
much more readable for people that extend the StandardClassLoader for their own
purposes.
