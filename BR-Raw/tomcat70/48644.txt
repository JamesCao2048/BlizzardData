48644 – Code should never ignore throwable
There seem to be quite a few places where code catches Throwable and ignores it.
For example:
ant.jmx.JMXAccessorQueryTask.bindAttributes
ant.jmx.JMXAccessorTask.execute
core.StandardContext - lots of methods
In most cases, catching Exception would be enough.
