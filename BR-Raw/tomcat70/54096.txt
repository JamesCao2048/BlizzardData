54096 – env-entry rejects legal types
In servlet 3.0 the type in an env-entry can be any type which has a public constructor taking a single String (or character) as an argument.
Tomcat only accepts a fixed list of types (see NamingContextListener from line 813).
This is legal in web.xml but not accepted by tomcat:
<env-entry>
<env-entry-name>location</env-entry-name>
<env-entry-type>java.io.File</env-entry-type>
<env-entry-value>/var/lib/tomcat</env-entry-value>
</env-entry>
