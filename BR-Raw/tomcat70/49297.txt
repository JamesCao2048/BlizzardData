49297 – Whitespace absence is allowed before attribute name in a custom tag

2010-05-15_tc7_attribute_name_whitespace-test.patch
The /test/webapp-3.0/bug45nnn/bug45015b.jsp page of trunk contains the following text:
<tags:echo echo="hello "wo"rld" />
Running the test (testBug45015b of org.apache.jasper.compiler.TestGenerator) produces the following message:
org.apache.jasper.JasperException: /bug45nnn/bug45015b.jsp(21,30) equal symbol expected
It means, that the parser interprets "wo" as an attribute name, ignoring the fact that there is no whitespace before it.
If I write
<tags:echo echo="hello "wo="rld" />
the test complains that attribute "wo" is invalid for the tag,
and finally if I write
<tags:echo echo="hello "echo="rld" />
the test succeeds, while I would expect it to fail.
I am attaching a patch that adds a testcase based on the last example, though a better testcase is needed that does not use the same attribute name twice.
I think it is a minor issue, because this issue does not affect valid JSP pages, though allows to run some invalid ones.
It is reproducible in the current 6.0 and 5.5 as well (thus 6.0.26, 5.5.29):
if I add the following to /webapps/examples/jsp/simpletag/foo.jsp of TC6 (or the respective page in TC5.5):
<ul>
<eg:foo att1="1"att2="2"att3="3">
<li><%= member %></li>
</eg:foo>
</ul>
and call http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/simpletag/foo.jsp
the page runs successfully and displays "1, 2, 3" list items among its output.
Expected result: show some compilation error, e.g.
">, /> or whitespace was expected".
