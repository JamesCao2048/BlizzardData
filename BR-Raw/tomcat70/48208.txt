Created attachment 24546 [details]
patch_48158_c5_wildCard.txt
as per bug 48158 comment 8, this is now an RFE on its own:
Luciana has come up with a patch to allow accepting any client certificate on a
per Connector basis.
In server.xml the following attribute should be added in the Connector element:
<Connector ...
acceptAllCerts="true"/>
If this argument is present and set to true or yes, then the
AcceptAllTrustManager will be used as Trust Manager.
The "truststoreFile" of
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/ssl-howto.html#Edit%20the%20Tomcat%20Configuration%20File
can be left empty
