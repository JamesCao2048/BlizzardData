33356 – Incorrect parsing of tag attributes
I get a org.apache.jasper.JasperException: with the error: "The function string
must be used with a prefix when a default namespace is not specified" when
trying to compile the following within a JSP page:
<foo:set var="bar" value="this $ is a { silly string ("/>
"foo" is our own tablib, it seems that Jasper seems to think that the string
provided to the value attribute contains some JSP/EL which it does not.
If I change the page to be:
<c:set var="bar" value="this $ is a { silly string ("/>
Then I do not get this error.
However I need to use my own taglib.
In the foo.tld file, the "value" attribute of "set" has rtexprvalue=true.
If I set this to false then the problem goes away.
However I noticed that c.tld
in standard.jar also has rtexprvalue=true for the "value" attribute of "set".
Why the difference in behaviour ? We also wish to have rtexprvalue=true.
