49428 – Fix WebDAV mounts from Windows Mini-Redirector clients
Created attachment 25584 [details]
The patch for WebdavServlet
The WebdavServlet does not work with native Windows clients besides the deprecated Web Folders.
The more modern, common and supported by Microsoft client, Windows Mini-Redirector that allows mapping of WebDAV shares to local drives cannot mount a WebDAV share served by tomcat's WebdavServlet.
You can observe this by using the following command from a windows machine:
> net use * http://hostname:8080/webdav
It should fail without the attached patch.
The reason is that:
DAV: namespaced elements in a PROPFIND responses can not use a default namespace; each element must be explicitly prefixed with a namespace prefix defined in itself or a parent.
If a default namespace is used the client will give no errors, but will not display any resources.
This is mentioned here, albeit for a single Windows version, Windows Server 2003:

I have verified that the patch fixes WebDAV mounts for Windows XP, Vista & 7.
