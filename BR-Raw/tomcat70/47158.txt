47158 – I think AccessLogValve has race condition problem
"Double-Checked Locking" pattern is heavily used in this class, but the usage of it in AccessLogValve has some issues of race condition judging by this article: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html
Based by this article, I think these variables in this class should be declared as volatile to get rid of race condition:
private volatile long currentMillis;
private volatile  Date currentDate;
