55801 – Add ability to provide custom SSLContext for websocket client
Created attachment 31059 [details]
Proposed patch
Currently the only available customisation is setting trust store via SSL_TRUSTSTORE_PROPERTY.
This is not enough in situations where custom trust manager has to be used.
The most trivial example I can think of is accepting all certificates.
My proposition is to use new property to pass SSLContext using user properties of ClientEndpointConfig.
Attached is a proposed patch to add this capability.
