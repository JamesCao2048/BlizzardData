56430 – Extension mapping that includes a dot in the extension does not work
Chapter SRV.11.2 of the servlet specification defines...
A string beginning with a '*.' prefix is used as an extension mapping.

So, this tells us, the url-pattern '*.jsp' forwards all requests ending with '.jsp' to the mapped servlet or filtes.
With this, one might also assume that the url-pattern '*.my.txt' forwards all requests ending with 'my.txt' to the configured servlet or filters.
But the latter does not work with Tomcat.
I set up a tiny maven project, for illustrating the problem: https://bitbucket.org/benplocek/servlet-extension-mapping-test
This project contains a Servlet and a Filter, both mapped to '.my.html':
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>*.my.html</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
When sending a request to /test.my.html Tomcat responds with a 404.
I also deployed this app to Jetty 9.1.4 which behaves as expected: /test.my.html invokes the filter and also serves the servlet.
Because of this I assume this is a bug in Tomcat.
Note: Also applies to Tomcat 8.0.5.
