56383 – Securing ErrorReportValve [PATCH]
Created attachment 31507 [details]
Patch for ErrorReportValve
When the default error valve returns its report it publishes the tomcat version and some other troubleshooting data.
This of course breaks security standards at some companies and also is published as a item that needs to be remediated when hardening tomcat(OWASP - goo.gl/Zr9xso ).
When using the OWASP solution of replacing the serverInfo.properties file it can and will break tools/code that uses that information.
Attached is the proposed enhancement to be able switch options to show minimal information back.
By adding the below will only return a html page with only the status.
No CSS or title
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve" showReport="false" showServerInfo="false" />
Currently, default is true for both so if users still want to see the current report nothing will have to change in there server.xml
