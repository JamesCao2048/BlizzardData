49109 – RealmBase.authenticate uses toString on byte array
catalina.realm.RealmBase.authenticate(String username, byte[] credentials)
has the following code:
return (authenticate(username, credentials.toString()));
This looks wrong, as credentials is a byte array.
It should probably be:
return (authenticate(username, new String(credentials[,charset])));
