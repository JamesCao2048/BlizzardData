48551 – StringCache: Use entrySet() rather than keySet() + get()
Created attachment 24846 [details]
Replace keySet() + get(key) with entrySet()
Using entrySet() to iterate over a map is faster than using keySet() followed by get(key).
Sample patch attached.
There are quite a few other examples elsewhere in the Tomcat code.
I can provide patches for those if required.
