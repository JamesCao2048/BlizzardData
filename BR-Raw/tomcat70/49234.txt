Descriptor Modification
Package: org.apache.catalina
I have slightly modified mbeans-descriptor.xml in above package as below.
1.
Removed username and password attributes from the User mbean object since it exposes username and the password of the users.
2.
Modified some attributes as non writeable according to the context.
