50646 – Tribes ByteMessage will get corrupted if message size exceeds the underlying buffer size
The Tribes ByteMessage class is used to transfer byte payloads in the context of the tribes communication framework.
Due to how the message is deserialized, there will be data loss (and hence corruption) if the message size exceeds the underlying buffer size.
The solution is to replace an ObjectInput#read(byte[]) call by ObjectInput#readFully(byte[]).
Fix is attached.
