55851 – Tomcat SPNEGO authenticator incompatible with IBM JDK: Accept Security Context needs to be wrapped around a Privileged Action in order for server side authentication
Created attachment 31098 [details]
Contains GNU unified diff of SpnegoAuthenticator and its modified format
Hi
Problem report:-
In bug report 55760, a change was made in which system property javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly is no longer set to false.
So it naturally follows that GSSAPI AcceptSecContext method is wrapped in a PrivilegedExceptionAction.
It is found in IBM JDK that it fails otherwise.
Cause of failure:-
When IBM JDK tries to fetch credential in GSSAPI AcceptSecContext method, it does so from JAAS Subject.
Since this call is not performed in Subject.doAs, the call fails as IBM JDK does not have access to a JAAS subject and cannot fetch a credential.
Please find attached:-
1.
File containing gnu unified diff format of SpnegoAuthenticator with its modified version.
PLEASE NOTE THIS DIFF IS ON TOP OF BUG FIX REPORTED IN 55760.
This file now also contains AcceptAction class which wraps GSSAPI AcceptSecContext as a PrivilegedExceptionAction.
This fix solves the issue by allowing IBM JDK to fetch credential from JAAS Subject.
Yours sincerely
