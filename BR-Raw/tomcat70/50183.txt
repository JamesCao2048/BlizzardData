50183 – [Tribes] Bio Sender is not scheduling the task to the excecutors
Created attachment 26228 [details]
proposed patch
Hi,
I'm using apache tribes outside of Tomcat.
Although my version is not the latest one, the bug also occurs in Trunk.
It seems that there was a refactor (using executors instead of threads and monitors) and BioReceiver is not scheduling the task.
(I think that the patch is much more descriptive than any comment I could write)
Regards,
Ariel
