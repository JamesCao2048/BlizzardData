38352 – Additional Entries for Default catalina.policy file.
This patch adds additional entries to the catalina.policy file.
Specifically:
The catalina.base/shared directory is added and given equal permissions to
catalina.home/common
java.io.tmpdir is now readable.
javax.servlet.context.tempdir is now readable.
I think to be compliant with the
spec, this must be allowed.
Directory specified by java.io.tmpdir (which is what tomcat points
javax.servlet.context.tempdir to) is now read, write, delete.
Again, I think the
spec requires this.
