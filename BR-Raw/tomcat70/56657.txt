56657 – Parallel deployment. If sessionid belongs to the latest version of webapp, use the latest version.
In 8.0.9, 7.0.54: [1]
Reviewing the loop that finds correct web application version by a sessionid.
Looking at [1], there shall be a "break;" after line 921.
This matters in the following rare scenario:
1.
There are several versions of the same web application that are deployed in parallel.
2.
The same sessionid is valid both for the latest version and for some older one.
3.
Expected result: map request to the latest version of the webapp.
Actual result: the latest version will be skipped and the request will be mapped to an older version.
