58522 – concurrency problem corrupts WARDirContext.Entry children
We discovered a problem where calling ServletContext.getResourcePaths from a jsp may corrupt WARDirContext.Entry.children.
The WARDirContext.list(Entry) method performs an Arrays.sort(children) call which is not thread-safe.
Calling this from multiple request threads may result in the children array losing some entries and duplicating others.
When entries representing directories in the war are lost, Tomcat cannot load resources from there.
Static resource requests result in http error code 404 and jsp compliation can throw JasperException when included files are not found.
We have seen this on CentOS 6.5 (and newer versions) with Tomcat 7.0.52 and Java 1.7.0_51.
The following are attached in the zip:
* Test case project which demonstrates this corruption.
It usually requires multiple runs.
* A stack trace illustrating the problematic flow.
* A patch file for WARDirContext.java.
