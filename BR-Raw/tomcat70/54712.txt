54712 – Prefer Locale.ENGLISH over Locale.US for case conversion
Created attachment 30060 [details]
Convert Locale.US to Locale.ENGLISH in case conversion methods
Case-conversion using toLowerCase or toUpperCase needs a Locale parameter to avoid using the default (with possibly unexpected results in some Locales).
The code currently uses Locale.US in several places.
However most of the code uses Locale.ENGLISH.
The code should standardise on ENGLISH.
Or perhaps consider using Locale.ROOT (@since 1.6)?
