53960 – Extensions to HttpClient test helper class
Created attachment 29443 [details]
Enhancements to HttpClient including preparation for no-cookie tests
Ref: "FormAuthenticatorTest for cases without cookies - implementation issues" on the tomcat dev list.
The attached patch prepares the HttpClient abstract helper ready for use by new Authenticator unit test cases.
The change includes style cleanup, new public methods, logic refactoring and new private methods.
This change leaves the class 100% backward compatible with all existing unit tests.
When each of the concrete Authenticator tests are eventually extended, the new logic in HttpClient will be fully used for existing as well as new test cases.
