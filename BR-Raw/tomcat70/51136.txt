51136 – Allow to set the context name through Tomcat's embeded class before adding it to the host
org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat creates contexts and add them to the host directly.
It would be nice if we could set the name of the context before adding it to the host.
I'm including a patch that overloads the methods "addWebapp" and "addContext" to take that name as a parameter.
