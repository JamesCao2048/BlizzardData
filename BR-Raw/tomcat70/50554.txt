50554 – Bad use of getClass() could potentially lead to concurrency bugs in future
The method org.apache.naming.java.javaURLContextFactory.getInitialContext(Hashtable<?,?>) has a synchronized block on getClass().
Using getClass() as lock is a bug pattern because if some class subclasses javaURLContextFactory and getInitialContext gets called on an instance of such a subclass, getClass() will return a different Class object for that instance.
Locking different objects for different classes is usually not the expected behavior.
Therefore, I suggest to remove this bug pattern by simply replacing getClass() by javaURLContextFactory.class.
See https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/LCK02-J.+Do+not+synchronize+on+the+class+object+returned+by+getClass%28%29 for more information about this bug pattern.
