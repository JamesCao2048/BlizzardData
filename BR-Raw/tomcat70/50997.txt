Fix for directories in classpath not ending with .jar
We use eclipse sysdeo tomcat plugin for eclipse.
It allows us to add target build directories of eclipse into tomcat classpath.
All works fine until we decided to use web-fragment functionality.
It failed to work despite the config:
<JarScanner scanAllDirectories="true"/>
I fixed the problem.
Please, see attached proposed patch.
