52586 – When requests are forwarded, the request attribute javax.servlet.forward.path_info is assigned an incorrect value.
As per the servlet spec, the values for:
javax.servlet.forward.request_uri
javax.servlet.forward.context
javax.servlet.forward.servlet_path
javax.servlet.forward.path_info
javax.servlet.forward.query_string
MUST be set to the values from the very first servlet that serviced the current request.
 However, it seems that Tomcat is populating path_info with the value of the LAST path_info serviced in the request (i.e.
the final servlet that serviced the request).
 It's possible the other value assignments are afflicted by similar defects, I've not explicitly tested for this.
Because of this issue, it's impossible to correctly reconstruct the original request's URI piecemeal by concatenating context+servlet_path+path_info+?+query_string, since path_info will contain the path to another servlet and thus this concatenation will produce a probably invalid URI target.
Therefore, creating "click here to retry" links is impossible without workaround code.
The critical issue here is the deviation from the servlet spec, which spells out the behavior of those attributes.
