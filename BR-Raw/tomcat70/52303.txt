52303 – NonLoginAuthenticator does not honour session timeout with SingleSignOn Valve
Created attachment 28052 [details]
proposed diff to fix org.apache.catalina.authenticator.NonLoginAuthenticator
This problem has been explored and discussed on the tomcat-users mailing list under the title "SingleSignonValve and webapp session timeout".
Basically, a webapp that does not need to define a <login-config> is valid under the servlet 3.0 spec and therefore should be able to participate in a single signon realm.
It should be able to inherit the security principal established by another webapp within the same realm.
Its own <session-timeout> value should be honoured, even when all the other sessions in the same SingleSignOnEntry have expired.
The problem is with NonLoginAuthenticator - at some time it had SSO helper logic that was too primitive.
This logic was completely commented-out in tomcat 6.0.0.
I have two fairly simple webapps (not quite drop-ins) that demonstrate the problem and my proposed fix.
I have heavily commented my proposed fix to explain the surrounding dependent logic that it relies on.
At the moment I have not found an SSO-based unit test for any of the AuthenticatorBase concrete classes, but I will try to create one (eventually).
