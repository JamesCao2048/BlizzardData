19444 – JNDI Authentication roles must be anonymous accessible
It appears that for the JNDIRealm to be able to locate roles, they must be
anonymous accessible.
I believe that for security purposes this should not be
necessary if we are validating the user by binding to the directory.
In that
case the roles could be accessible to any bound user or that particular user.
I
discussed this very briefly on the Tomcat user list.
It sounds like this had
been discussed previously and for whatever reason, the idea rejected.
Anyhow I
submit that there is a bug, either in the code - which requires the roles to be
anonymous, or in the documentation which does not make it clear that this is
the case (at least in "Tomcat 4 Servlet/JSP Container - Realm Configuration HOW-
TO).
It seems reasonable to me that if we are binding to the directory to
authenticate, we would have that user's access to roles.
Perhaps the
documentation should more explicetly state that this is not the case.
In the hope that it would be accepted as an enhancement, I am going to attempt
to attach a modified JNDIRealm that uses the authenticated connection to obtain
the roles.
Thank You,
Art
