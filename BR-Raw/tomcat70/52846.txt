52846 – Programmatic login using UserDatabaseRealm returns 403 error.
IMHO,HttpServletRequest#login does not need to define a <login-config>.
NonLoginAuthenticator is used when <login-config> is not specified in HttpServletRequest#login.
When UserDatabaseRealm is used, not GenericPrincipal but Memory User is set to a session.
In AuthenticatorBase#invoke, principal registered into a session is set to a request.
Because MemoryUser is set to a request as principal, RealmBase#hasRole always returns false.
As a result, 403 error is returned.
