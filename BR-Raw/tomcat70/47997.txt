47997 – NamingContextListener fails to add itself as a PropertyChangeListener to all namingResources
Created attachment 24378 [details]
proposed fix
In the NamingContextListener.lifecycleEvent(LifecycleEvent) method, the
NamingContextListener object fails to add itself as a PropertyChangeListener to
namingResources whose context is not a Server, e.g.
a Context instance.
 This
prevents the NamingResourcesMBean from working with non-Server contexts.
