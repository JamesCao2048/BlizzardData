52444 – Classloading-based ServletContainerInitializer @HandlesTypes processing can result in long startup times
See 52326 for background, noting particularly the following:
"As long as SCI processing involves expensive classloading, larger applications will suffer from long startup times and thus be encouraged to "shut off" this functionality via metadata-complete='true'."
This issue, then, is intended to address classloading-based approach to @HandlesTypes processing by replacing it with something faster and generally less problematic.
 ASM would be one way to get it done.
