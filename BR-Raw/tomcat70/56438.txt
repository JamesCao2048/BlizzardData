56438 – If jar scan does not find context config or TLD config, log a message
I went through the same process as many others migrating to Tomcat 7.
My simple war application took orders of magnitude longer to load than in Tomcat 3.3, and root cause was new Tomcat 7 / Servlet 3.0 jar scanning to look for context config fragments.
This is a very painful process.
I had to use FINE log level, parse thousands of Tomcat log messages, and google the various messages.
This was a waste of time.
All Tomcat 7 needed to do was log a message when the jar scan did not find anything in a jar, and recommend adding that jar to one of the filters in catalina.properties.
tomcat.util.scan.DefaultJarScanner.jarsToSkip
org.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig.jarsToSkip
org.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig.jarsToSkip.
As an enhancement, please add a log message recommending adding a jar if scanning does not find anything.
I would recommend setting the log level to FINE, and explicitly putting a logging.properties override for that message in logging.properties.
Anyone new to Tomcat 7 can fix these messages by either following the recommendation, or commenting out the logging.properties override for the message.
This is low hanging fruit.
It should be straight forward to add, and would be a huge help for anyone new to Tomcat 7 who are unaware of the performance impact of Servlet 3.0 jar scanning.
It could even help Tomcat 7 veterans too, when they add/upgrade/replace existing jar files that unknowingly affect jar scanning performance.
Thank you.
