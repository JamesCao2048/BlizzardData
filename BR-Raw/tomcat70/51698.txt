51698 – ajp CPing/Forward-Request packet forgery, is a design decision? or a security vulnerability?

ajp CPing packet forgery example
because the ajp "Data" packet no "CodeType"
and tomcat adopts lazy-reading strategy for reading ajp "Data" packetï¼Œ
(i.e., if you don't invoke request.getParameter("XXX")ï¼Œtomcat does't read post request "Data" packet)
soï¼Œthe current "Data" packet keeping in the socket inputstreamï¼Œ
the connection is keep-alive, ajp bio/nio procesor reading the next packetï¼Œ
this time, is "Data" packetã€‚
if the first byte of "Data" packet'length is 0x02(Code Type of Forward Request Packet) or 0x0A(Code Type of CPing Packet)ï¼Œ
then tomcat will be in trouble.
