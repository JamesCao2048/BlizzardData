54851 – Folder without web-fragment.xml should not impact the status of distributable
Created attachment 30200 [details]
patch
revision 889701 "JARs without any web.xml fragments should not impact the status of distributable" was applied to scan(JarURLConnection jarConn), but was not applied to scan(File file).
I ran into this while trying to run cluster nodes from inside eclipse/wtp which supplies some folders to WebappClassLoader.addRepository(), e.g.
<another workspace project>/classes.
This causes the app to be marked as distributable=false, regardless of supplying the <distributable/> tag in the web.xml.
The attached patch resolved the issue for me.
Thanks.
