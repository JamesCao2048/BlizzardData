53301 – Servlet init method called twice with embedded Tomcat
When using embedded Tomcat, the servlet init method is called twice by the container.
This has been seen with an Apache DirectMemory unit test.
I have checked with a normal Tomcat launched by the Tomcat Maven plugin (mvn tomcat7:run) and in this case, the init method is correctly called once.
