55656 – Server ClassLoader not used for Server creation
Created attachment 30931 [details]
proposed patch
When configuring server.loader in catalina.properties with libraries containing valves or realms and their dependencies, if those classes are set in server.xml a CNFE is thrown.
The reason is Digester using StandardServer's ClassLoader and not context ClassLoader.
