45279 – McastServiceImpl leaks sockets.
McastServiceImpl does not close its socket in stop() as it claims.
It merely calls leaveGroup(), which is sufficient to stop receiving messages, but does not close the socket.
This causes a file descriptor leak each time the service is stopped.

socket.close();
