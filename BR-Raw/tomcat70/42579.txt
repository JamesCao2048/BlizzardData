42579 – [Patch] JNDIRealm fails to parse absolute names
Active Directory can respond to a query with SearchResult's that are not
relative.
 We discovered this happening with a directory hosted across many
servers when the userBase was not sufficient to identify a single server.
In getUserBySearch, JNDIRealm assumes that the SearchResult is relative and goes
about creating a DN for the user by appending together the various bits of names
it gets back.
 This is definitely wrong for absolute names which are URL's of
the form:  ldap://server/encoded_user_dn
I discovered this issue in Tomcat 5.5 and a cursory look at the SVN repo for
Tomcat 6.0 reveals that this bug is also present there.
I have a patch for this issue which I will attach.
