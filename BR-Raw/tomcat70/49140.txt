49140 – Inefficient use of keySet() iterator in StandardContext.java
Created attachment 25316 [details]
Change keySet() Iterator to values()
The loadOnStartup(Container[]) method of StandardContext loops on the keySet() but actually only uses the key to get the values, so it would be more efficient to use the values() Iterator.
According to the Javadoc, the keySet() and values() iterators generate the entries in the same order (key ascending).
Findbugs detected another 6 such instances for which I can provide patches if required.
