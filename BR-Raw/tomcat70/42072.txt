42072 – The call of the jspDestroy method violates it about the Java Servlet Specification 2.4, SRV.2.3.2.1.
When a JSP is accessed for a second time, the jspDestroy method is called even
if a ServletException is thrown from the init method of the class that extends
HttpJspPage.
This violates the Java Servlet Specification 2.4, SRV.2.3.2.1.
