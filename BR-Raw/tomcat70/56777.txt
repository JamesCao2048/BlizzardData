56777 – Allow configuration resources to be loaded from places other than straight off the filesystem
We're using embedded Tomcat in Spring Boot (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot).
Spring Boot allows a user to create an executable jar file that contains Tomcat and their application.
The idea is that an application can, if so desired, be entirely contained within the jar with no external dependencies.
Currently, this breaks down if a key store or trust store is required for SSL configuration as Tomcat requires them to be readable directly from the filesystem rather than from within a jar file.
I'd like to propose an enhancement to Tomcat that introduces a resource abstraction, allowing configuration resources to be loaded from within an archive and perhaps even broader than that.
(Jetty, for example, allows a resource to be loaded from a URL).
