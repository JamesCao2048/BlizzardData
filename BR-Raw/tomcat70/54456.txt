54456 – ChunkedInputFilter returning EOF when client closes connection without sending end chunk
Created attachment 29874 [details]
Patch to fix the bug
In my case client is processing user's InputStream and then sending data in chunks to server.
At server end I read till EOF.
Client can be simple Java program or a web application.
I am facing issue when client gets error on user's InputStream and closes connection with server.
In that case ChunkedInputFilter is returning -1.
I have added logs and confirmed that endChunk is false.
Issue was fixed after I added following just before "return result;"
if (result == -1 && !endChunk)
throw new EOFException("Unexpected end of stream while reading chunk body");
I think ChunkedInputFilter should return -1 only when it gets endChunk.
Also, from client end I am always sending complete chunk.
So, in ChunkedInputFilter I should get EOF from socket stream while reading next chunk header (which is handled properly in ChunkedInputFilter) but that is not happening.
I have attached patch.
