48629 – JNDIRealm and roleNested doesn't work with roleSearch="(member={1})"
Created attachment 24898 [details]
patch
roleNested introduced with Tomcat 6.0.24 works well with roleSearch="(member={0})", but not with roleSearch="(member={1})"
From tomcat doc :
"Use {0} to substitute the distinguished name (DN) of the user, and/or {1} to substitute the username."
I've attached a patch to change line :
filter = roleFormat.format(new String[] { groupDN });
into :
filter = roleFormat.format(new String[] { groupDN, groupDN });
Like that it handles both {0} and {1}.
Regards,
Gabriel.
