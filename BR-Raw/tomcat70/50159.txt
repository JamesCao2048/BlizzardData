50159 – JNDI context returns new datasource instance each request
Requesting a javax.sql.DataSource via JNDI results in a new instance each time.
In my particular case I have defined a c3p0 connection pool as follows:
<Resource auth="Container"
name="jdbc/mydb"
description="My Database"
factory="org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory"
type="com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource"
driverClass="org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver"
jdbcUrl="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb?autoReconnect=true"
user="myUserName"
password="myPassword"
minPoolSize="5"
maxPoolSize="50"
acquireIncrement="1"
idleConnectionTestPeriod="100"
maxIdleTime="1800"
preferredTestQuery="SELECT 1;"
/>
I am using a 3rd party library to access the datasource.
 Each time a request is made I can see a new connection pool being created.
 With a simple test I was also able to see that the instance being returned was different each time.
 Test code:
Context initialContext = new InitialContext();
return ((DataSource)initialContext.lookup(this.dataSource)).getConnection();
When comparing the source code for org.apache.naming.NamingContext between 7.02 and 7.04 the following 4 lines of code were removed (line 808):
if (obj != null) {
entry.value = obj;
entry.type = NamingEntry.ENTRY;
}
Adding this code back into the class fixes the issue.
