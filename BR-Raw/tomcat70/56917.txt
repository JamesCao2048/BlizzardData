56917 – Create a configuration to write relative 302 responses instead of absolute
Create a Tomcat configuration to force tomcat to write relative location headers in 301/302 responses instead of absolute location headers.
Purpose:
Today Tomcat always writes an absolute response for redirects per RFC2616 standards.
 However as many modern browsers support 302s to relative Locations as explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_location , our friendly Tomcat application server should allow configuration to write back 302s in the more friendly form.
The ripple effect of this where applications choose to use this setting, will be very good for cpu cycles of web servers and load balancers all over the world.
  This can greatly reduce the need for ProxyPassReverse in the Apache web server, and also for URL rewriting happenin in physical load balancers.
See this example where another gentleman has been compelled to recompile Tomcat to achieve the same thing
