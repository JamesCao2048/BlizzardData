27988 – Unhelpful FileNotFoundException raised
org.apache.naming.resources.DirContextURLConnection raises FileNotFoundException
on lines 311, 344, 382 and 396.
 It would be more helpful if these provided a
message string.
For example, change line 344 to
throw new FileNotFoundException(getURL().getFile());
This would make it easier to diagnose mistakes in server configurations.
