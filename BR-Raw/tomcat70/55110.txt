55110 – Wasted work in "TestNonLoginAndBasicAuthenticator.doTestBasic"
Created attachment 30450 [details]
patch
The problem appears in version 7.0.41 and in revision 1493861.
 I
attached a one-line patch (patch.diff) that fixes it.
In method "TestNonLoginAndBasicAuthenticator.doTestBasic", the loop
over "authHeaders" should break immediately after "methodFound" is set
to "true".
 All the iterations after "methodFound" is set to "true" do
not perform any useful work, at best they just set "methodFound" again
to "true".
Method "TestWsWebSocketContainer.testSessionExpiryContainer" has a
similar problem (the loop over "setA" should break immediately after
"isOpen" is set to true).
 I attached another one-line patch
(patch2.diff) for this problem.
Method "startInternal" in class "StandardHost" has a similar loop
(over "valves"), and this loop breaks immediately after "found" is set
to "true", just like in the proposed patches.
 Other methods (e.g.,
"MapperListener.findDefaultHost", "CollectVisitor.checkSeen",
"JspDocumentParser.processChars", "ParameterParser.isOneOf") also have
similar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed patches.
