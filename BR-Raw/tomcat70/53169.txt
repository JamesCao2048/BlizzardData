53169 – [patch] don't do chunking with Connection: close
Created attachment 28702 [details]
patch against trunk
The attached patch disables chunking on if there is a Connection: close header, we're on HTTP 1.1 and there's no Content-Length header.
This helps to implement Server-Sent Events [1].
Server-Sent Event are conceptually similar to the forever streaming iframe in the sense that there's an "infinite" response from the server that always gets updated.
But they're easier to use and with less issues.
They are also easier to use than WebSockets if you don't need a back channel.
The specification reccoments to disable chunking.
Jetty implements the same behavior, when there's a Connection: close header it doesn't do chunking.
The following discussion [2] leads me to believe that patches would be welcome.
The patch comes with unit tests that verify that there is still chunking happending when there is no Connection: close header.
