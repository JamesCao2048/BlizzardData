41869 – Should EL (Expression Language) expressions result in the TagData.REQUEST_TIME_VALUE object?
I have a custom tag with attributes defined in the TLD file as allowing run-
time expression values, meaning:
<rtexprvalue>true</rtexprvalue>
I also have a TagExtraInfo class that I am using to validate the values
provided.
Inside my TagExtraInfo sub-class I have code such as this:
Object attr = data.getAttribute("groupSize");
if ( attr != null &&
!attr.equals(TagData.REQUEST_TIME_VALUE)
{
and so on.
  When, in my JSP, I provide attribute values such as "<%= 10 * 14
%" (JSP scriplet) I do indeed get the TagData.REQUEST_TIME_VALUE object back
on this call.
However, when I instead have an EL value, something like "${groupSizeValue}",
I do not received the REQUEST_TIME_VALUE distinguished object back.
 I receive
a String object, containing the text "${groupSizeValue}".
 Is this the correct
behavior?  Everything I have read (books, Google searches, etc.) seems to
point me in the thinking that this is a bug.
From looking at the tomcat 5.5.20 and 5.5.23 source code, I see where the
JspAttribute (nested class of Node) is created.
 In the Validator class, line
1117, is the creation for this object passing the constant "false" for
the "expr" argument (5th argument to the 1st ctor of this class).
 I believe
it is line 1117 that would be getting executed since the if statement
preceding this is:
if (el.containsEL() && !pageInfo.isELIgnored()) {
So, my question is, why would an EL expression when EL is not being ignored be
considered not an expression?
