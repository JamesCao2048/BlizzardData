49102 – coyote.ajp.Constants - 3 "constant" arrays are mutable
The class coyote.ajp.Constants contains 3 public static non-empty String[] arrays:
methodTransArray
responseTransArray
headerTransArray
responseTransArray only appears to be locally, so could be made private.
The others are used in index lookups, so get(index) methods could be used to protect them.
