55453 – AJP send Body with Status 304
When Status 304 is set to the Response, AJP send the Body to Apache2.
In the HTTP-Connector there is a check against 304, see Method "prepareResponse" in Class org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractHttp11Processor.
304 with Body will corrupt Apache2, see Bug https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23181
