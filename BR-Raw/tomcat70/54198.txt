54198 – Improve HttpServletResponse#sendError(int) JavaDoc description
This methods calls sendError(int, null) internally.
Thus generating a HTML page without a message.
This is not mentioned in the docs.
One could assume that the response will be empty.
One could duplicate the first paragraph of the sendError(int,String) method and alter it to "The server defaults to creating the response to look like an HTML-formatted server error page with any specific message, setting the content type to "text/html",..." further "If an error-page declaration has been made for the web application corresponding to the status code passed in, it will be served back." (Might need improvement in this case, I am not a native speaker).
Moreover, I would add "This method is effectively the same as calling sendError(int, null)".
Plus add @see #sendError(int,String).
Though the JavaDocs seems to be a verbatim copy of Oracle's Servlet API, it does not reveal this information explicitly.
Should I provide a patch if that doc is available in svn.apache.org?
