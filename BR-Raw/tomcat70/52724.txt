52724 – An incomplete fix for the resource leak bugs in Catalina.java
The fix revision 730178 was aimed to remove an resource leak bug on the  FileInputStream object "fis" (created line 458), the Socket "socket" (created at line 477),
the OutputStream object "stream", and the FileInputStream object "inputStream" in the file "/tomcat/tc7.0.x/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/startup/Catalina.java" , but
it is incomplete.
There are some problems:
1.
the InputSource object "is" created at line 452 is not closed.
2.
when the statements at lines 455-457 throw some exception, the "fis" can not be closed as expected.
3.
when the statements at lines 480-483 throw some exception, the "socket" and the "stream" can not be closed as expected.
4.
when the statements at lines 574-576 throw some exception, the "inputStream" can not be closed as expected.
The best way to close such resource objects is putting such close operations in the finaly block of a try-catch-finally structure.
