56712 – Off-by-one second errors in time calculations in PersistenceManager
The fix for bug 56698 (r1608443, r1608448) implemented an automated test for PersistenceManager.
Reviewing the manager code to investigate the test failures, I see two issues:
Checks that evaluate idle time of a session in PersistenceManagerBase typically do the following:
> int timeIdle = (int) (session.getIdleTime() / 1000L);
> if (timeIdle > maxIdleBackup) { ...
}
I see two errors in those two lines:
Error 1.
----
The integer division performs truncation.
Comparing the code with documentation, the condition there shall be
> if (timeIdle >= maxIdleBackup) { ...
}
It does no matter much for a real-world configuration where the times are expected to be tens of seconds, but it matters for the test case that wants to run fast.
Error 2.
----
StandardSession.getIdleTime() performs a validity check and can throw an ISE which is unexpected here.
It shall be replaced with a call to session.getIdleTimeInternal().
