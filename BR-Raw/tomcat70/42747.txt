42747 – Context className attribute ignored for contexts deployed from descriptors in web/META-INF/context.xml
When deploying an app from a context descriptor inside a webapp/META-INF
directory via context.xml, the className is ignored and the context is created
as a StandardContext.
 I've tried to use a ReplicatedContext class in a cluster
from this configuration and it does not work.
 However, it does work if i move
the context.xml to $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[EngineName]/[HostName]/webapp.xml.
