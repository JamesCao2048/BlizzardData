47524 – McastServiceImpl executor is not dispatching events.
Created attachment 23977 [details]
Fix proposal
The class McastServiceImpl does not dispatch events, because the the executor is not creating threads.
The class ReceiverBase has its own queue to address this issue.
I have refactored the code a little to reuse the class.
(attaching the diff file)
I'm not sure if filing a bug in Bugzilla is the right procedure for Trunk branch.
If not, could you please tell me how should I proceed?
