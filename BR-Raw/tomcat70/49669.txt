49669 – Static reference from javax.security.auth.Policy.contextClassLoader prevents an undeployed Web application from being garbage collected
Overview
The class javax.security.auth.Policy has a static member contextClassLoader that can refer to the WebappClassLoader of an application.
If that happens, the web application cannot be garbage collected after undeploy.
Steps to reproduce
Create a web application that uses Axis 1 as SOAP server.
Deploy the web application in Tomcat.
Make a SOAP call to the webapplication.
Undeploy the web application.
Wait an hour.
Make a memory dump using jmap, and inspect the memory using jhat.
Actual results
The WebappClassLoader for the web application is still present.
Its "reference chains from rootset" shows a reference like this:
System Class Reference :
--> class javax.security.auth.Policy (84 bytes) (static field contextClassLoader:)
--> org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader@0xeb52ba60 (165 bytes)
Expected results
There is no WebappClassLoader for this web application anymore.
