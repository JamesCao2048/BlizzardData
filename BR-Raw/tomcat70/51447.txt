51447 – Session type changes from Backup to Primary
Created attachment 27223 [details]
patch
Steps to reproduce:
(1) Start 3 Tomcat instances that are using BackupManager.
(2) Run 3 HTMLManagers corresponding to each node.
(3) Run web application that has distributable in its web.xml.
(4) Click the link of the number of sessions for this application.
(5) If the displayed session type is Backup, click the link of session id.
And return to sessions list page soon.
Then, the session type change to Primary.
When the session detail page is displayed, getSessionForNameAndId() calls ctxt.getManager().findSession(), and findSession() calls session.get(id).
If the cluster is using BackupManager, "session" is instance of LazyReplicatedMap.
And LazyReplicatedMap.get() set session type to "primary".
I thought the solutions of this issue.
(A) Not use findSession().
Retrieve session information from local map.
-> see attached patch
Or
(B) Write the note as follows to the sessions list page.
"If you click the backup type's sessionid, then the type change to primary."
