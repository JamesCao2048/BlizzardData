46471 – Compiled tag files from different tag libraries share the same package
When in web application there are several tag libraries packed in jar files that have tag files in them, when those files are compiled they share the same package:
org.apache.jsp.tag.meta
As a result, if there are tags with the same name in different libraries, only one of them survives.
I encountered it while investigating bug #37084.
See comment #13 there.
