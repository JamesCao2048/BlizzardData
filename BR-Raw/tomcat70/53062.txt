53062 – Tomcat doesn't normalize absolute urls for redirect
Created attachment 28582 [details]
A demo app that demonstrates the problem.
Issue a request to /serv1 and check the produced 'Location' response header
Issuing a redirect like:
response.sendRedirect("./serv2");
will lead to a response header like:
Location:http://localhost:8080/./serv2
and this causes problems for some not that smart user agents like Internet Explorer and JMeter.
The problem has been reported few times in Apache Wicket's Jira.
Wicket works only with relative urls and lets the web container to make them absolute when a redirect is needed.
But it seems only Tomcat produces absolute urls with '../' and/or './' inside and let the user agent to normalize them.
Other web containers normalize the url at the server side and make user agents life easier.
