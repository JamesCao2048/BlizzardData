49151 – ClassCastException in BackupManager#stopInternal.
In BackupManager#startInternal,
When constructor of LazyReplicatedMap throws exception,
sessions is not LazyReplicatedMap.
Actually, AbstractReplicatedMap#init has the possibility of throwing RuntimeException.
In BackupManager#stopInternal ClassCastException is thrown
because AbstractReplicatedMap#breakdown is executed regardless of the type of sessions.
should be changed as follows to avoid ClassCastException.
===
skip.
if (sessions instanceof LazyReplicatedMap) {
LazyReplicatedMap map = (LazyReplicatedMap)sessions;
if ( map!=null ) {
map.breakdown();
}
}
skip.

This problem exists in Tomcat7.0 and 6.0.
Best Regards.
