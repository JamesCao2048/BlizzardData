54144 – Processing of java.io.Reader in "Out" tagplugin
Reviewing r1401816 I see two issues in tagplugin o.a.jasper.tagplugins.jstl.core.Out:
The code that the plugin generates calls value.toString(), default.toString() and passes these String values to the static method Out.output(...).
This new method was added in r1401816.
I think the output() method should accept Objects instead of Strings, because the following is wrong:
1.
The evaluation of default.toString() is not needed at all if the default is not used.
2.
The JSTL spec (1.1, 1.2) says that there is special processing if value is java.io.Reader.
There is no such processing in the current code.
(It seems that this feature was added in JSTL 1.1).

If the result of the evaluation is not a java.io.Reader object, then it is coerced to
a String and is subsequently emitted into the current JspWriter object.
If the result of the evaluation is a java.io.Reader object, data is first read from the
Reader object and then written into the current JspWriter object.

These two issues are not new - they existed before the recent changes.
