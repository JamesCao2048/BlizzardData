39572 – fixes to use CompressionFilter in WebSphere app server
There are a couple of small bugs in the compression filter classes that are
triggered by using the filter in WebSphere 5.1 or 6.
Here are patches.
- CompressionResponseStream should not compress the output stream if the
response has been committed (because then it cannot write the Content-Encoding:
gzip header, and the browser displays the compressed output as-is)
- CompressionServletResponseWrapper causes a NullPointerException if you flush
before writing anything
