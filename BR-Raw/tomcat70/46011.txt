46011 – Cannot access to Principal via Subject.getSubject(AccessController.getContext())
Cannot access to Principal via Subject.getSubject(AccessController.getContext()).
Problem is that in method internalDoFilter of ApplicationFilterChain in call of filter chain the code determinate the Principal but don't use it:
if( Globals.IS_SECURITY_ENABLED ) {
final ServletRequest req = request;
final ServletResponse res = response;
Principal principal =
((HttpServletRequest) req).getUserPrincipal();
Object[] args = new Object[]{req, res, this};
SecurityUtil.doAsPrivilege
("doFilter", filter, classType, args);
args = null;
} else {
In this manner a SecurityUtil.doAsPrivilege will be called with Principal == null
and method execute create a Subject with no Principals.
Then call a Subject.doAsPrivileged(subject, pea, null);  and this do not propagate Principals.
I obtain a Subject without Principals calling Subject.getSubject(AccessController.getContext()).
