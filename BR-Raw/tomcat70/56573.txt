56573 – [Spec?] Session.getRequestURI() doesn't return the protocol, port etc.
The spec is unclear about it, but
Session.getRequestURI();
doesn't return the full path, e.g for an enpoint, it returns
/atmosphere-chat
"instead" of
ws://host:port/atmosphere-chat
The issue I'm facing is an application cannot rebuidl the full URL as the port is missing, and there are no way to find the port without the proper URI.
