43366 – Session Statistics command in manager fails with "Unknown command /sessions"
A documentation page for Tomcat 6 at
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Session%20Statistics
allows for the following command to be used in the manager:
http://localhost/manager/sessions?path=/
This used to work in Tomcat 5.
In Tomcat 6, the following error is returned:
FAIL - Unknown command /sessions
I have created two different installations of Tomcat 6.0.14 (one on CentOS 5,
and one on Fedora 7).
Both installations exhibit the same failure.
