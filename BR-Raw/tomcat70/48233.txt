48233 – Loggers should be private
Created attachment 24560 [details]
Patch to fix many of the non-private loggers.
Loggers are intialised with the class name, so it does not make sense to me to
allow them to be used by other classes, i.e.
the logger should be private and
final.
Note that the ReceiverBase class had a setLog() method which I removed in order
to make the log final.
