56013 – SpnegoAuthenticator not working in IBM JDK v7 for Kerberos due to incorrect credential lifetime
Created attachment 31208 [details]
Unified GNU diff format of SpnegoAuthenticator.java and its updated version
Hi
SpnegoAuthenticator is not working with IBM JDK v7.
The option GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME specified while generating ticket creates the following exception:-
major code: 11, minor code: 0
major string: General failure, unspecified at GSSAPI level
minor string: Desired initLifetime zero or less)
However specifying GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME as lifetime of credential resolves the issue.
I am attaching a patch which optionally chooses cred lifetime as indefinite or default depending on whether the JDK is IBM JDK or Oracle/Sun JDK.
This patch is with respect to SpnegoAuthenticator.java of tomcat v 7.0.50
Impact of fix:-
1.
If not fixed then Tomcat does not work out of the box for Spnego Authentication(Kerberos) for IBM JDK v7
2.
The fix affects only IBM JDK and does not change the execution flow for Oracle/Sun JDK
Yours sincerely
