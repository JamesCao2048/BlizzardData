55073 – wasted work in ValidateVisitor.isExpression()
Created attachment 30404 [details]
patch
The problem appears in version 7.0.40 and in revision 1490425.
 I
attached a two-line patch that fixes it.
In method "ValidateVisitor.isExpression", the loop over "nodes" should
break immediately after "elExpression" is set to "true".
 All the
iterations after "elExpression" is set to "true" do not perform any
useful work, at best they just set "elExpression" again to "true".
Method "startInternal" in class "StandardHost" has a similar loop
(over "valves"), and this loop breaks immediately after "found" is set
to "true", just like in the proposed patch.
 Other methods (e.g.,
"MapperListener.findDefaultHost", "CollectVisitor.checkSeen",
"JspDocumentParser.processChars", "ParameterParser.isOneOf") also have
similar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed patch.
