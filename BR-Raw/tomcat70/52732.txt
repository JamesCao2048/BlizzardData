52732 – An incomplete fix for the resource leak bug in ExpressionFactory.java
The fix revision 1043157 was aimed to remove an resource leak bug on the BufferedReader object "br " (created in line 231), the InputStream  object "is" (created in line 222 or 224) in the method "getClassNameServices()" of the file
"/tomcat/trunk/java/javax/el/ExpressionFactory.java" , but it is incomplete.
There are some problems:
1.
when "br" is not created successfully but the temp InputStreamReader is created successfully at line 231, the temp InputStreamReader will be leaked.
The best way to close such resource objects is putting such close operations for each resource object in the finaly block of a try-catch-finally structure.
