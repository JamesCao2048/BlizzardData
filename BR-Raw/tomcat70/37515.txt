37515 – smap not generated by JspC when used from Ant for precompilation
I've noticed that in Tomcat 5.5.12 one can pass the JspC task an smapSuppressed
attribute.
Unfortunately, it appears that one *still* cannot do source-level debugging of
JSPs when they are precompiled via JspC with smapSuppressed=false in 5.5.12.
Note that the same JSP are source-level debuggable in exactly the same set up if
they are compiled on the fly by Tomcat.
Unfortunately I am baffled as to why this does not work...
