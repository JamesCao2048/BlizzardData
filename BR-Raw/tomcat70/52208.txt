52208 – NullPointerException in tribes.transport.nio.NioReceiver.listen() in test run
Created attachment 27968 [details]
TEST-org.apache.catalina.tribes.group.interceptors.TestOrderInterceptor.BIO.txt
Running tests for 7.0.23 release candidate I noted that there was a NullPointerException in one of tribes tests:
TEST-org.apache.catalina.tribes.group.interceptors.TestOrderInterceptor.BIO.txt
18.11.2011 9:27:56 org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.nio.NioReceiver listen
SEVERE: Unable to process request in NioReceiver
java.lang.NullPointerException
at org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.nio.NioReceiver.listen(NioReceiver.java:274)
at org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.nio.NioReceiver.run(NioReceiver.java:414)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)
------------- ---------------- ---------------
The test case did not fail, so it likely occurred during tearDown.
The line in source code is
268        while (doListen() && selector != null) {
(..)
272                events();
273                socketTimeouts();
274                int n = selector.select(getSelectorTimeout());
It is likely that selector field referenced on line 274 became null because of NioReceiver#stopListening() call.
This issue was not observed on reruns.
I am attaching complete log file from this test.
