54115 – Minor enhancements to HttpClient test helper class
Created attachment 29566 [details]
patch to HttpClient
Main reason for this change is to add two new accessor methods to the enhanced logic in https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53960.
I also took the opportunity to make the sendRequest method tolerant of null elements in its input array.
Finally, I added comments (definitely not proper javadoc!) to some other methods to clarify their purpose.
This change is 100% backward compatible.
