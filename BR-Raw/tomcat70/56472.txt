Classes that hold a reference to WebappClassLoader
I have a problem with unloading casses of a web application when I stop it.
All threads are closed, but all 6.000 classes remain in memory.
The GC cannot destroy WebappClassLoader because it is held by a static hashMap of the naming services which is hold by the VM.
See attached image.
The problem occurs only when the application uses the naming service.
I identified the first method in my application that triggers the problem:
public class MyBindAuthenticator extends BindAuthenticator {
...
@Override
public DirContextOperations authenticate(Authentication authentication) {
...
List<String> userns=getUserDns(username);
...
}
...
}
When I replace this line by a hardcoded list of strings, then the problem gets triggered by the next call of any naming service method.
When I replace the whole authenticate() method by an empty one, then the problem disappears.
But I need it for security reason.
Unfortunately, the problematic hashmap (with name securityTokens) is not accessible to me, so I cannot remove the references.
I seems that all related classes are part of Catalina and not reachable from outside.
I would appreciate a workaround, if not bugfix is available.
