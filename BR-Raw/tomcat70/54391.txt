In Servlet spec 3.0 Rev.
a at the end of chapter 8.3 the following is written
(page #87 (109/230)):
[quote]
In addition, a Servlet 3.0 compliant Servlet container must provide a
ServletContext attribute with name javax.servlet.context.orderedLibs,
whose value (of type java.util.List<java.lang.String>) contains the list of
names of JAR files in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the application represented by
the ServletContext, ordered by their web fragment names (with possible
exclusions if fragment JAR files have been excluded from absolute-ordering), or
null if the application does not specify any absolute or relative ordering.

In the source code there is a constant ServletContext.ORDERED_LIBS, but I see no code where it were used.
My understanding is that the list should contain just the jar names, e.g.
["foo.jar", "bar.jar"] and be absent if there is no ordering.
