48172 – JspRuntimeContext synch. problems.
JspRuntimeContext.jspReloadCount is synchronised when updated, but not when read by getJspReloadCount().
If the instance is accessed from multiple threads, then the returned value may not be the current value, it could be arbitrarily stale.
If this is acceptable, then the Javadoc should say so; otherwise the getter needs to be synch.
(or the field needs to be volatile) Or just use AtomicInteger.
==
Various other fields are neither final nor synchronized, e.g.
classpath
codeSource
etc.
As far as I can tell, these could easily be made final as they are only written by the constructor.
