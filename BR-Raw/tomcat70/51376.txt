51376 – Dynamically added Servlet instances ignore setLoadOnStartup(), @ServletSecurity, etc
When a pre-existing instance of Servlet class is added dynamically by calling ServletContext.addServlet(String, Servlet) in ServletContainerInitializer, multiple problems arise:
* setLoadOnStartup() is ignored
* @ServletSecurity is ignored
* destroy() can be called on non-initialized servlet
Adding a servlet class (addServlet(String, String), addServlet(String, Class)) doesn't have this problems.
It happens because methods of org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapper treat presence of servlet instance as an indicator of the fact that servlet have been initialized, that is not true when addServlet(String, Servlet) is used.
