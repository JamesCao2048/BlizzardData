52173 – Add a drop of additional clarification to doc on the delegate setting of the WebappClassLoader
Created attachment 27931 [details]
javadoc tweaks to WebappClassLoader
There is a full description of the 'delegate' flag on the protected boolean member, but programmers using the class are likely to look to the setDelegate function for enlightenment.
Further, the IMPLEMENTATION NOTE at the top does
not mention the existence of the delegate flag.
This patch tries to makes it harder to misunderstand, since the term 'delegate' has, to me at least, a bit of ambiguity to it.
