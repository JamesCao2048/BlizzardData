43893 – WebdavServlet returns incorrect values for the "href" property when it is mapped with / url prefix, instead of /*
Deploy the attached WAR file under a vanilla installation of Tomcat 6.0.14,
then send the following WebDAV request (I simply pasted it in netcat, maybe
telnet will work too if you don't have netcat):
PROPFIND /webdav/file.txt HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
User-Agent: Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.0
Host: localhost:8080
Depth: 0
Don't forget to press enter twice at the end.
Observe the result:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<multistatus xmlns="DAV:"><response><href>/webdav/file.txt/file.txt</href>
<propstat><prop><creationdate>2007-11-18T07:42:14Z</creationdate>

</prop>
<status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</status>
</propstat>
</response>
</multistatus>
Note in particular the incorrect value in <href>/webdav/file.txt/file.txt</
href>, paths are being duplicated.
This wouldn't usually be a big problem as many WebDAV clients don't rely so
much on this "href" value, but the Apache slide-webdavlib client library relies
on it and breaks if it's incorrect, so any WebDAV enabled applications using
this library will not work with Tomcat 6.
That's the only reason I marked this
bug as major, apologies if it's a wrong classification.
