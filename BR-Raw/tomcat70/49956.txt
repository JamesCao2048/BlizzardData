49956 – @Resource(name=) Normalization of JNDI Name
Created attachment 26048 [details]
Resolves issue
name attribute of @Resource defines JNDI name of the resource that binds the resource to web component java:comp/env/.
java:comp/env/bla..bla..
could be given as a JNDI name.
Therefore before using name in DefaultInstanceManager to inject fields & methods, it must be normalized.
For example,
@Resource(name="java:comp/env/myDataSource")
DataSource ds;
Before looking up "context.lookup(name)" in DefaultInstanceManager, we have to normalize name to "myDataSource".
Patch is attached
