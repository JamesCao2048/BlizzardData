47216 – Possible NPE in Http11Processor.action()
The code at around line 1075:
} else if (actionCode == ActionCode.ACTION_REQ_LOCAL_ADDR_ATTRIBUTE) {
if (localAddr == null)
localAddr = socket.getLocalAddress().getHostAddress();
fails to check if "socket != null".
Since this is checked everywhere else in the method this is probably a bug.
The method Http11Processor.parseHost() also references "socket" without checking for null.
Within the class, it is only called by process(Socket), which guarantees that it won't be null.
However once process() returns normally, socket will be set to null.
The parseHost() method is public, so it may be called when socket == null.
Perhaps the parseHost() method should be private?
