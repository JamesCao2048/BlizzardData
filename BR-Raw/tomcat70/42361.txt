42361 – POST content type incorrect for multipart forms after login
When using a form with a custom encoding (e.g.
"multipart/form-data"), the
content type is not restored after a redirect to a login page (auth-method = FORM).
To reproduce:
- A page that POSTs using multipart/form-data encoding (or anything other than
application/x-www-form-urlencoded) to a result page that is protected by a login
page (auth-method=FORM) is invoked.
- Even though the multipart POST data exists (verified by reading input stream
of request from result page) the content type of the request is always
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
- This only happens when redirected to the login page first.
 It does not happen
if already logged in.
