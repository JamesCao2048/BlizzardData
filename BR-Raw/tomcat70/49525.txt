49525 – IE8: Unabled to store data in HttpSession (root context)
Environment:
Tomcat 7.0.0 Beta
IE8
A simplest webapp only have a test.jsp below:
<%=request.getSession().getId()%>
this app installed as root context
the test.jsp works fine in firefox
but when using IE8
there is always a different session id where refresh the test page.
BTW: the test.jsp works find in Tomcat 6.x
