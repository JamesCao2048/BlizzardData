50207 – CometProcessor async timeout events are not being fired
This is reproducible using the the default chat example (ie: ChatServlet, /examples/jsp/chat) and the following additional changes:
1) Enabled Http11Nio in conf/server.xml:
<Connector
address="0.0.0.0"
port="8080"
protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
connectionTimeout="20000"
enableLookups="false"
acceptCount="100"
disableUploadTimeout="true"
maxThreads="15"
minSpareThreads="15"
maxSpareThreads="15"
RECYCLE_FACADES="true"/>
2) Enabled the comet valve in conf/context.xml:
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.CometConnectionManagerValve" />
The problem is CometEvent.EventType.ERROR (and subtype TIMEOUT) and CometEvent.EventType.END are never being fired.
This can be confirmed in the logs; the messages for these events are never printed.
 This worked on Tomcat 6.0.29.
As an aside, what is the most complete/robust way to do async IO in tomcat 7 today, Servlet 3.0 or CometProcessor?
