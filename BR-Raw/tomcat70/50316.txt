50316 – Minor glitch with display of negative TTL on sessionDetail.jsp
Created attachment 26331 [details]
sessionDetail.jpg - screenshot
To reproduce
1.
Start Tomcat
2.
Create a session
3.
Stop Tomcat.
Wait for more than TTL (default: 30 minutes).
Start Tomcat.
4.
Go to the Manager web application and look at the Session Details page for the session.
I had some instance of 6.0.29 lying on my drive for several months.
The TTL value was printed as "0-2982:0-20:0-59" instead of "-2982:20:59".
I am attaching the screenshot.
 I wonder why the session was still alive, but that is a different question.
The bug is in JspHelper.secondsToTimeString(), as it does not deal with negative values.
