53366 – Running with SecurityManager: protected/index.jsp returns blank page when it is the first page accessed
eproducible in 7.0.27 and in current 7.0.x.
To reproduce:
1.
Start "catalina.bat start -security"
2.
Go to
[1] http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/security/protected/index.jsp
3.
Expected result: Display login form.
Actual result:
Blank page.
Access log shows:
127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jun/2012:04:35:23 +0400] "GET /examples/jsp/security/protected/index.jsp HTTP/1.1" 200 -
That is, response code is 200, count of bytes is '-'.
If I stay on [1] and keep refreshing it, the problem persists.
But if I visit [2], then [1] starts to work.
I suspect that some class needs to be preloaded.
