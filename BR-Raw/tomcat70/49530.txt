49530 – Context is not correctly stopped at shutdown
Created attachment 25669 [details]
Application that show the behavior
Apparently a web application context is not correctly stopped when shutting down Tomcat 7.0.0.
I noticed that the destroy() method of a Servlet that's loaded on startup was not called, and put together a test case (see attached files).
The test servlet writes to System.out on init() and destroy(), the output on init appears in logs/catalina.out, but no output on destroy.
From what I  understand of the attached log, the context isn't stopped at all.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
copy attached startupServlet.war to webapps
2.
start Tomcat, then "StartTestServlet.init" appears in catalina.out
3.
stop Tomcat
Actual Result:
no output appears in logs/catalina.out
Expected Result:
"StartTestServlet.destroy" appears in catalina.out
catalina.log shows evidence of context /startupServlet being stopped
