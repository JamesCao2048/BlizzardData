50547 – The CHANGE_SESSION_ID message that received during cluster session synchronization is dropped.
Neither CHANGE_SESSION_ID message nor SESSION_EXPIRED message set timestamp.
If these messages are received during cluster sessions synchronization in DeltaManager startup,
because the timestamp is not set, they are dropped.
I made a patch that add timestamp for CHANGE_SESSION_ID and SESSION_EXPIRED message.
Best Regards.
