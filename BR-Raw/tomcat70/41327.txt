41327 – Jasper does'nt display the full path of the file in a 404 Not found error page
When you try accessing a non-existent jsp page in a webapp, tomcat(jasper)
doesnt display the full path of the file which was not found in the browser.
example:
Accessing a non-existent jsp page say a.jsp with this url
http://localhost:8080/jsp-examples/a.jsp would return a 404 Not Found error page
which displays "/a.jsp not found".
Rather it should be "/jsp-examples/a.jsp not found".
