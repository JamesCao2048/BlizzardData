53342 – If starting immediately after Tomcat stop fail, BindException will throw.
e.g.
When Context#stop throw LifecycleException, the main thread stops,
but startStopThreads of Host/Engine will remain for a while.
Because, startStopThreads is not a demon thread.
As a result,
even if a main thread stops, Acceptor Threads of 8080/8009 is not stopped.
keepAliveTime for 10 seconds is set up now.
===
startStopExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
getStartStopThreadsInternal(),
getStartStopThreadsInternal(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
startStopQueue);
===
Therefore, in order to avoid BindException, the waiting for 10 seconds is required.
I think that I need to make startStopThreads into a demon thread.
Best Regards.
