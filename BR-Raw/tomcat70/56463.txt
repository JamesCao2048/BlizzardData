Looking at Tomcat bug 56383 - "Securing ErrorReportValve" (
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56383 ), i think a
similar thing can also be done for the Tomcat version number reported by
the DefaultServlet.
This servlet will show the version information from ServerInfo when the
listings are enabled.
Currently it seems there is no way of disabling
version reporting other than 'hacking' the ServerInfo.

There is a way to customize those listings: define an XSLT style sheet.
That said, it is possible to introduce a configuration option for DefaultServlet.
Places to patch:
- DefaultServlet.java
- webapps/docs/default-servlet.xml
- webapps/docs/security-howto.xml
