57331 – Allow ExpiresFilter to use "year" as synonym for "years" in its configuration
The current code is
if ("years".equalsIgnoreCase(currentToken)) {
durationUnit = DurationUnit.YEAR;
} else if ("month".equalsIgnoreCase(currentToken) ||
"months".equalsIgnoreCase(currentToken)) {
durationUnit = DurationUnit.MONTH;
...
The above if/else tree misses "year" case.
All other time units have support for singular form, e.g.
"months"/"month" above.
This was observed by a stackoverflow user [1].
The following configuration fails:
<init-param>
<param-name>ExpiresDefault</param-name>
<param-value>access plus 1 year</param-value>
</init-param>
but succeeds if one replaces s/year/years/.
