12428 – request.getUserPrincipal(): Misinterpretation of specification?
When calling request.getUserPrincipal() from an unprotected resource, the method returns
null even when the user is actually authenticated.
From Servlet 2.3 spec:
public
java.security.Principal getUserPrincipal()
Returns a java.security.Principal object
containing the name of the current
authenticated user.
If the user has not been authenticated,
the method returns
null.
My interpretation would be that once a user has been
authenticated, a call to getUserPrincipal() would always return the associated Principal
object whether it is from a protected or unprotected resource.
