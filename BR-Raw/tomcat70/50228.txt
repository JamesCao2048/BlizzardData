50228 – PermGen leak when calling JspFragment.invoke() with a custom Writer
Created attachment 26266 [details]
writerleak.war - Reproduces the leak
We have a web application that contains a SimpleTag that calls JspFragment.invoke(writer) with a custom java.io.Writer (actually, a NullWriter from commons-io).
When this application is undeployed, it still remains in memory, as reported by the "Find leaks" tool in the manager webapp.
I am attaching a simple sample application that reproduces the issue.
To reproduce:
1.
Deploy the app.
2.
Open index.jsp
3.
Undeploy the app.
4.
"Find leaks" reports that the app is still in memory
Using the Eclipse MAT tool I can see that the leak is caused by o.a.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl keeping a reference to the Writer,
while the BodyContentImpl instance is cached in some pool referenced by a ThreadLocal.
