Patch to revert isSecure() check

CLN 1126273

sets the default value for securePagesWithPragma to false, but also (re)added a request.isSecure() check to the block for adding the cache-control headers.
This results in the headers not being added for secure requests with security-constraints.
 This is a change in behavior from Tomcat-7.0.14 that causes IE8 to improperly cache some secure pages.
The secure check was initially added in CLN 287690
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=287690
to fix a bug in IE caching
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6641
but was commented out in CLN 302373
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=302373
patch to remove isSecure() check added.
