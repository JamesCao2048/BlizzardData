Created attachment 33650 [details]
Zip file containing java and xml sources
I have created a simple Servlet which is configured to use the SingleSignOn valve in combination with BASIC authentication.
When the servlet invalidates the session it results in a warning:
Mar 08, 2016 12:20:06 PM org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn expire
WARNING: SSO unable to expire session [Host: [localhost], Context: [/webproject], SessionID: [B2F3A538F5971CA3FC1EEE38CC2FFE95]] because the Session could not be found
The problem can also be reproduced on Tomcat 8.0.32
