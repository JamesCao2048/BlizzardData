46915 – Unable to get ResourceBundle keys in Tomcat 6
Created attachment 23417 [details]
modified foreach.jsp file that reads properties file
There is issue with ResourceBundle using JSTL in tomcat 6.
The problem is in using the following code
${messageString.resourceBundle.keys}
The above code is not able to resolve the keys and result in printing of ???keys???
Here messageString is a variable set using below code
<fmt:setBundle basename="LocalStrings" scope="session" var="messageString" />
I have tested it with example jsp provided in the tomcat's example webapp.
The issue is reproducible with both JSTL1.1 and JSTL 1.2 and JDK 1.5 and 1.6
However it is working fine in Tomcat 5.5
Attached is the sample foreach.jsp with modified code to read a property file available in \webapps\examples\WEB-INF\classes folder under tomcat installation directory.
Just place this file in examples webapp and view source
