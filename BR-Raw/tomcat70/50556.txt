50556 – improve JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener against leak caused by LdapPoolManager
When class com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapPoolManager is initialized, if if the system property com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.timeout is set to a value greater than 0, a PoolCleaner thread is spawned, without fixing a specific context class loader.
If the initialization of the class is triggered by a web application, its class loader will be used by the PoolCleaner thread.
If that web app is stopped, its class loader will leak.
We can improve JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener to prevent that leak.
