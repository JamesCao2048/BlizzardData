54127 – WsOutbound is missing a ping method
Created attachment 29577 [details]
patch which adds ping functionality to WsOutbound
WsOutbound currently lacks the ability to send a ping request to the client.
Attached patch creates a new method pong which takes in a ByteBuffer and passes the ping byte (0x09) to sendControlMessage which sets the opcode byte on the frame.
 Refactored pong method to all call sendControlMessage as opposed to duplicate code.
Added websocket.Constants import for OPCODE_PING/PONG.
