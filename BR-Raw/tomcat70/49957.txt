49957 – Work directories of deployed webapps are deleted at shutdown
Created attachment 26050 [details]
stacktrace
Observing this with the current trunk (at rev.
998656).
It does not happen with 7.0.2, so it is some recent regression.
The problem is that when I stop Tomcat all subdirectories in ${catalina.base}/work/Catalina/localhost are deleted.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Build Tomcat 7.0
2.
Set JRE_HOME variable.
Go to output/build/bin/ and run catalina.bat start
3.
Access http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/jsp2/el/basic-arithmetic.jsp
4.
Note, that there is compiled class file in
output/build/work/Catalina/localhost/examples/org/apache/jsp/jsp/jsp2/el/
5.
Run catalina.bat stop
6.
Actual behaviour: output/build/work/Catalina/localhost/ is now empty.
Expected behaviour: see step 4.
The catalina.log file has "INFO: Deploying web application directory" lines it it, but there are no logs about any webapps being undeployed.
I have run TC7 in debug mode with breakpoints in ExpandWar.delete(..) and the deletion happens in ContextConfig.destroy().
// Changed to getWorkPath per Bugzilla 35819.
String workDir = ((StandardContext) context).getWorkPath();
if (workDir != null)
ExpandWar.delete(new File(workDir));
I am attaching the full stacktrace.
The code itself looks old.
I suspect that the destroy event was not passed to ContextConfig until recently.
