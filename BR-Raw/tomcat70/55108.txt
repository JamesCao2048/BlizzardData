55108 – Wasted work in "AbstractReplicatedMap.excludeFromSet"
Created attachment 30448 [details]
patch
The problem appears in version 7.0.41 and in revision 1493861.
 I
attached a one-line patch that fixes it.
In method "AbstractReplicatedMap.excludeFromSet", the loop over "mbrs"
should break immediately after "include" is set to "false".
 All the
iterations after "include" is set to "false" do not perform any useful
work, at best they just set "include" again to "false".
Method "inSet" in the same class "AbstractReplicatedMap" (right above
the definition of "excludeFromSet") has a similar loop (over "set"),
and this loop breaks immediately after "result" is set to "true", just
like in the proposed patch.
 Other methods (e.g.,
"MapperListener.findDefaultHost", "CollectVisitor.checkSeen",
"JspDocumentParser.processChars", "ParameterParser.isOneOf") also have
similar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed patch.
