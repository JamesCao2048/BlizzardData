44494 – Requests greater than 8k being truncated.
After updating to Tomcat 5.5.26 from Tomcat 5.5.23 we appear to be having trouble with requests, that are greater than 8k, being truncated with the CoyoteRequest.getReader() method.
The following steps caused this issue to appear:
1.
I constructed a post request from a jsp page which exceeded 8k in size.
2.
In the corresponding servlet I call request.getReader() and pipe the returned BufferedReader into a string.
3.
Inspection of the string reveals that the content is  being truncated after 8k.
4.
If I replace the request.getReader() method call with request.getInputStream() no truncation occurs.
Also, after reverting back to Tomcat 5.5.23 and using the request.getReader() method no truncation occurs.
