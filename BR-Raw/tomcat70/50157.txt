50157 – a lot of MapperListener is registered as ContainerListener of StandardContext
Created attachment 26213 [details]
patch for MapperListener.java
The same five MapperListener is registered as ContainerListener of StandardContext.
At first when I add StandardHost by using "Engine addChild operation" via JMX, same MapperListener is registered as ContainerListener of StandardHost.
StandardEngine.addChild()
->StandardEngine.addChildInternal()
->StandardEngine.fireContainerEvent()
->MapperListener.containerEvent() line: 133 <-- here
...
->MapperListener.containerEvent() line: 135
->MapperListener.registerHost() line: 276 <-- here
Therefore, StandardHost has the same two MapperListener as ContainerListener.
---
Then, starting StandardHost by using "Host start operation", the same five MapperListener is registered as ContainerListener of StandardContext.
(1)LifecycleState of StandardHost is changed to STARTING.
StandardHost(LifecycleBase).start() line:140
->StandardHost(ContainerBase).startInternal()
...
->StandardHost(ContainerBase).fireContainerEvent <-- fireContainerEvent fire two times
...
->MapperListener.containerEvent() line:133 <-- here
...
->MapperListener.containerEvent() line:137
->MapperListener.registerContext() line:339 <-- here
(2)LifecycleState of StandardHost is changed to STARTED.
StandardHost(LifecycleBase).start() line:156
...
->MapperListener.registerHost() line:279
->MapperListener.registerContext() line:339 <-- here

I think that the memory is wasted a little because of the above issue.
On a related issue, MapperListener is not registered as Container/LifecycleListener for StandardContext on starting up Tomcat.
I attached the patch for above issues.
Best regards.
