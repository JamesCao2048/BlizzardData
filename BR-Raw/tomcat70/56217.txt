Tomcat Managet Status Page Screenshot
In Tomcat Manager Status Page, please make "Request" as Left align.
Currently "Request" column is Center align due to which if there are links with larger in length (Links with GET method) could not display in Desktop Screen.
To view these links, horizonatal scrollbar has to use.
If we could make it Left align, all links could be viewed in screen (atleast starting points of links).
Screenshot attached for more clarity and reference.
