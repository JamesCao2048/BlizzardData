43191 – compressableMimeType attribute ignored
I have set compression="on" and compressableMimeType="text/html" in server.xml.
It appears that the value of compressableMimeType is being ignored.
My XML
responses are all coming back gzipped.
If I switch to compression="off" the
responses are not gzipped, but as soon as I turn it on, regardless of the value
of compressableMimeType, the XML responses are coming back gzipped.
A full Connector tag follows.
Note that this is just an example -- I have tried
many values for compressableMimeType (that do NOT include text/xml) and the
responses are still compressed.
