55943 – Provide a way prevent looking at the System classloader before the webapp classloaders
I would like a way to prevent Tomcat from checking the System classloader before the webapp classloaders.
 This would be useful when using the embedded Tomact API to produce isolated servlet containers.
I ran in to some difficulty with this when I was adding Tomcat support to the SBT (Simple Build Tool) plugin: https://github.com/JamesEarlDouglas/xsbt-web-plugin
In particular I had an issue where SBT includes a version of the Scala standard library, on the system classpath, that has been run through Proguard.
 This  was conflicting with web applications that were including their own version of the Scala standard library.
 I was eventually able to work around this using this hack: https://github.com/JamesEarlDouglas/xsbt-web-plugin/commit/f8a9b149f0c7c87d7b6e8f862c493841d82ad90a However, it would be nice if there was a way to accomplish this that didn't involve such a hack.
I would be happy to submit a patch for this.
 However, I would like some guidence on how the API should be changed to accomplish this.
 Perhaps a new flag on the WebappLoader class?
Thanks
