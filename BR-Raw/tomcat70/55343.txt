55343 – Add flag to ignore exceptions while creating initial pool
I want my initial pool to be of some size i.e.
not empty AND start even if it fails to create all or some of connections.
If pool fails to create initial connections for some reason it just throws exceptions.
To workaround that I have to set initial pool size to 0.
It can be handy to add a flag to ignore (just log them) exceptions that occur while creating initial connections.
