51197 – sendError/sendRedirect don't work with AsyncContext
For some reason, response.sendRedirect and response.sendError are not producing expected behavior when using an AsyncContext.
 On the server side, the async request completes normally, and everything looks hunky dory, but the client never gets ANY response from the server.
 It appears that Tomcat simply times out after the default 10 seconds and closes the connection.
 No headers are returned, no content, nothing.
 I've confirmed with thread dumps that the server isn't stuck.
Yet...if you use response.setStatus and response.setHeader instead, it works absolutely fine.
 The client gets the response every time.
I put together a very simple test that isolates the issue reliably:
https://github.com/dcheckoway/async-test
See the README in there for details.
NOTE: the behavior for sendError changed slightly from 7.0.12 to 7.0.14.
 As of 7.0.14, sendError seems to close the connection immediately, but the client still never gets any response of any kind.
