55576 – Order of ServletRequest parameters is not preserved
The ServletRequest interface provides two methods to iterate through request parameters:
Enumeration<String> getParameterNames(), and
Map<String, String[]> getParameterMap()
Unfortunately, the underlying implementation in Tomcat is a HashMap, which fails to preserve the order of parameters as they are specified in the request.
An alternate implementation should be used to preserve request order.
 LinkedHashMap, for example, is capable of preserving insertion order.
The Servlet Specification (v3.0) speaks only to the relative ordering of query string data and post body data.
However, section 17.13.3 of the HTML specification (v4.01) titled "Processing form data", clearly states that "control names/values are listed in the order they appear in the document."
Therefore, I do not see a valid interpretation of either specification to rationalize Tomcat's implementation.
To receive a request with an ordered list of parameters and represent them in an implementation that is guaranteed not to preserve this order is difficult to rationalize.
