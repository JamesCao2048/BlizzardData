48345 – Session does time-out shorter than setting in web.xml when PersistentManager is used.
I am encountering the problem that Session does time-out shorter than setting in web.xml.
This is a simple scenario where the problem occurs.
I am using PersistentManager by the following configuration.
<Context>
<Manager className="org.apache.catalina.session.PersistentManager"
maxIdleSwap="120">
<Store className="org.apache.catalina.session.FileStore"/>
</Manager>
</Context>
I am setting the session-timeout at five minutes.
<session-config>
<session-timeout>5</session-timeout>
</session-config>
[scenario]
1.
Create Session.
2.
120 seconds pass.
Session does swapOut.
3.
In addition, 120 seconds pass.
Get Session.
Session does swapIn and access time of session in the memory is updated.
4.
In addition, 90 seconds pass.
Get Session.
Because the access time of the session has been updated in (3),
The session should be able to be acquired.
However, the session can not be acquired.
This cause is StoreBase#processExpires invoked between (3) and (4).
StoreBase#processExpire deletes the session saved in Store.
StoreBase#processExpires is as follows.
=====StoreBase#processExpires=====
public void processExpires() {
...
for (int i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
try {
StandardSession session = (StandardSession) load(keys[i]);
if (session == null) {
continue;
}
if (session.isValid()) {
continue;
}
...
if ( ( (PersistentManagerBase) manager).isLoaded( keys[i] )) {
// recycle old backup session
session.recycle();
} else {
// expire swapped out session
session.expire();
}
remove(session.getIdInternal());
} catch (Exception e) {
...
}
}
}
======
The session saved in Store is loaded, and StandardSession#isValid() is executed.
StandardSession#expire(true) is invoked for the session that passes
session time-out in "StandardSession#isValid()".
StandardSession#expire(true) invokes Manager#remove(Session).
As a result, the session is deleted from the session map.
In a word, session in memory is deleted by invalidating old session in Store.
As a result, session does time-out shorter than setting in web.xml
I made a patch against trunk.
Best regards.
