49555 – Custom Taglibs should support all parameters
I added two method <function>s with the same name but with an addition parameters.
 I get this error:
org.apache.jasper.JasperException: Duplicate function name list in tag library /WEB-INF/dataStore.tld
Crap!  It is not even looking at the parameters.
 Ok, Java matches on method names and method parameters.
 It is commonly called a method signature.
Well, Jasper is in the Google SDK, so it could perhaps be smarter than I am -- so maybe I overlooked something.
 Is that the case?
Why can't the Jasper compiler match on parameters like Java?  This is after all Java.
 I'm only using TLDs because they are cleaner then escaping Java code in JSP.
 I have already wrote a considerable amount of TLD code and it does not easily mix with the expression language.
 This is the reason why it is so important to have this implementation work as expected.
Please let me know how I can help.
 Lets get this fixed.
