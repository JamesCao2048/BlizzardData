55177 – connectionTimeout=-1 causes high CPU
Created attachment 30514 [details]
fix
Setting connectionTimeout to -1 in server.xml causes each request to have high CPU
java full version "1.6.0_51-b11-457"
Example:
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
connectionTimeout="-1"
redirectPort="8443" />
Everywhere I looked there seemed to be a if statement looking to see if it was below zero except in Http11Processor class.
Attached is patch file.
Which has resolved the issue on my server.
