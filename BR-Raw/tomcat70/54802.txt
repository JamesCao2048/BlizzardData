54802 – Provide location information for exceptions thrown by JspDocumentParser [PATCH]
Steps to reproduce - see bug 54801
It causes an exception to be thrown by
org.apache.jasper.compiler.JspDocumentParser.checkScriptingBody()
The issue is that the exception in bug 54801 does not provide any information on the file where it occurred.
It does not show in which tag file it happened, and thus it is hard to follow.
There are four places in JspDocumentParser where it throws a "SAXException" without any location information.
 I propose to replace
throw new SAXException(msg);
with
throw new SAXParseException(msg, locator);
I am not sure that line numbers will be correct in all four cases, but at least it will provide the name of the file.
This is better than nothing.
