53090 – Servlet superclass injection targets are ignored
Created attachment 28623 [details]
patch that shows the processing of the servlet's superclass injections
Hi folks,
I've been running Tomcat 7.0.26 in a JEE container against the EE6 Web Profile CTS.
In many of the tests there is the following scenario: A servlet 'X' extends a regular class 'Y'.
An env-entry element for a field in 'Y' with injection-target-class equal to 'Y' is defined in the app's web.xml.
The injection-target-name points to a field that is not annotated.
When the app boots and Tomcat handles the injections for the servlet it processes only those that are defined explicitly for the 'X' servlet's class name, ignoring its superclasses.
I'm attaching a patch I made on top of 7.0.x/trunk that fixed the issue.
It's quite small.
I believe Tomcat should respect the injections for the servlet's superclasses.
What do you think is the right behavior?
Thank you,
Bobby
