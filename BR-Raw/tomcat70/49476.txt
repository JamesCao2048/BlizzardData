49476 – Cannot expire selected session in Manager webapp
Running 7.0.0.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Login to the Manager webapp.
2.
In the "Sessions" column click on the number (1) in the "/manager" row.
The Sessions Administration page`[1] is opened.
3.
In the sessions list put a checkmark next to any session and press Invalidate selected Sessions button.
4.
Actual result: message:
FAIL: Nonce mismatch.
Command "/sessions" was ignored.
and the page displays the list of webapps.
Expected result: Invalidating a session and redisplaying the sessions list.
[1] http://localhost:8080/manager/html/sessions?path=/manager
Suspected cause is that [1] is opened with a GET query that does not include the nonce in its URL.
