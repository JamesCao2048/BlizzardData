53535 – Out of memory while performing ContextConfig.webConfig
Created attachment 29047 [details]
Suggested solution to improve ContextConfig
JavaClassCacheEntry objects are using too much memory causing eventually (all kinds of) out of memory errors during container startup.
There is no need to save whole JavaClass in cache since only superclass name and interface names are needed in later processing.
Suggested solution is attached.
