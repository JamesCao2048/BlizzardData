49426 – Manager app wrongly localized
Created attachment 25582 [details]
Patch (with unit test) fixing the problem for the ManagerServlet
The manager app shows message using the server's default locale whereas it should react on the request Locale.
The cause is that the ManagerServlet uses StringManager what is fine for messages that are logged but not for those that are sent as responses.
The attached patch fixes the problem for the ManagerServlet but not for the HTMLManagerServlet.
It will require a bit more refactoring there because the same messages may be intended for log or for output to the response.
I can propose a second patch for it once the problem has been fixed for the ManagerServlet.
For info: same problem occurs in Tomcat 6.
