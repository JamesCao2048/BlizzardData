50648 – RpcChannel improvements
Created attachment 26545 [details]
svn diff
This enhancement proposal addresses three separate issues with the RpcChannel tribes component.
1.
There is a minor bug in a catch(InterruptedException) clause, in which a call to Thread#interrupted() is made, as opposed to Thread#interrupt(), as it should be.
2.
The RpcChannel API user registers an RpcCallback to be notified of communication events.
However, there is no callback method for the case where the sending of a response message fails.
This proposal includes the addition of a corresponding callback for such cases.
To ensure backwards-compatibility, the additional callback method has been declared in a sub-interface of RpcCallback, named RpcCallback2 for the time being.
3.
Since the tribes classes are loaded by the tomcat loader, if the messages sent through tribes are instances of classes defined in the webapp, attemps to deserialize them will fail.
AbstractReplicatedMap includes a mechanism for the API user to specify class loaders to be used when deserializing map entries.
This enhancement proposal includes a similar mechanism for the RpcChannel.
Please find the proposed modifications attached.
