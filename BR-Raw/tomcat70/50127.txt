50127 – Possible NPEs in SimpleTCPCluster
Created attachment 26190 [details]
Patch to eliminate potential NPE
The code does this in several places:
if (object != null) {
...
}
object.method()
If the object can be null, then the method call should be in the conditional block.
If not, eliminate the check.
