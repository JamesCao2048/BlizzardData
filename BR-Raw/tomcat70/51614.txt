51614 – PersistentManager loads session from Store and calls session.expire() twice.
To check whether session is loaded into  memory, StoreBase#processExpires calls findSession(id).
=====
...
if (manager.findSession(keys[i]) != null) {
isLoaded = true;
}
...
=====
However, PersistentManager#findSession(id) loads session from Store when there is no session in memory.
Because session loaded from Store is an invalid session
PersistentManager logs errorlog, calls session.expire(), and deletes session from Store.
As a result, findSession(id) returns null, and isLoaded becomes false.
And, session.expire() is called again, and the session is deleted from Store.
If manager is PersistentManager, it is necessary to call PersistentManagerBase#isLoaded(id).
However, to avoid regression of r1033024, other managers call findSession(id).
Best regards.
