51887 – Speedup sessionid generation when running testsuite
Created attachment 27581 [details]
2011-09-24_tc8_DummySecureRandom.patch
When I run the Tomcat tests on Windows, I see a lot of following messages in the logs:
[junit] 24.09.2011 17:23:56 org.apache.catalina.util.SessionIdGenerator createSecureRandom
[junit] INFO: Creation of SecureRandom instance for session ID generation using [SHA1PRNG] took [5,019] milliseconds.
It is OK whan starting a single Tomcat instance, but when running tests it adds 5 seconds to each startup of Tomcat.
I am attaching patch that
1) Adds new DummySecureRandom class.
2) Hardcodes SessionIdGenerator to use this class.
The SessionIdGenerator part of the patch cannot be committed as is.
