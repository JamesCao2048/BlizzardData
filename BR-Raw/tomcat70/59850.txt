59850 – StatementCache interceptor does not seem to close ResultSets
It seems that when enabling the StatementCache interceptor, closeing the (proxy) statement does not cause open ResultSets to be closed.
This seems to be incorrect according to the Javadoc for Statement:
"A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results." -- <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html>
