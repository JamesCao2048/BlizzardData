46666 – Why is disableUploadTimeout and KeepAliveTimeout correlated in Http11 Connector?
In Http11Processor.java
while (started && !error && keepAlive) {
// Parsing the request header
try {
if (!disableUploadTimeout && keptAlive) {
if (keepAliveTimeout > 0) {
socket.setSoTimeout(keepAliveTimeout);
}
else if (soTimeout > 0) {
socket.setSoTimeout(soTimeout);
}
}
inputBuffer.parseRequestLine();
request.setStartTime(System.currentTimeMillis());
keptAlive = true;
if (!disableUploadTimeout) {
socket.setSoTimeout(timeout);
}
disableUploadTimeout  - This flag allows the servlet container to use a different, longer connection timeout while a servlet is being executed, which in the end allows either the servlet a longer amount of time to complete its execution, or a longer timeout during data upload.
If not specified, this attribute is set to "true".
The code above is waiting on a new Http Request and precedes the servlet processing logic.
 It seems odd to me that I must set disableTimeout to false to get my keepAliveTimeout set.
To set keepalivetimout, I must implicitely enable upload timeout whether I need it or not.
 It seems to me that the disableTimeout is unneccessary in the following line
if (!disableUploadTimeout && keptAlive) {
Do you agree with this?
Thanks for the insight
