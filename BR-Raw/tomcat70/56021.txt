56021 – SSL connector using windows-my keystore
Was trying to configure SSL on tomcat 7 to use Windows-MY keystore (provider that wraps the MSCAPI to access certificates in the keystore of Windows cert manager) but didn't get to work.
Tomcat startup fails to load the connector since it looks for a empty file for the keystore inside catalina_home directory.
But I got it working with a small code change in org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AbstractEndpoint.adjustRelativePath() method.
When Windows-MY keystore is used there is no physical keystore file.
To be able to pass in empty value for the keyStoreFile in the connector I added a check for not empty path before adjusting the path.
public String adjustRelativePath(String path, String relativeTo) {
String newPath = path;
if (!"".equalsIgnoreCase(newPath)) {
File f = new File(newPath);
if ( !f.isAbsolute()) {
newPath = relativeTo + File.separator + newPath;
f = new File(newPath);
}
if (!f.exists()) {
getLog().warn("configured file:["+newPath+"] does not exist.");
}
}
return newPath;
}
java version "1.7.0_07"
To reproduce (on windows):
1.
Install a cert to the windows cert manager (start run certmgr.msc).
2.
Configure the SSL connector with cert alias ('issued to' column value of the cert in the cermgr)
<Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
SSLEnabled="true"
maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
keyAlias="ssl.cert.alias"
keystoreFile=""
keystoreType="Windows-My"
clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
3.
Start tomcat
The fix has been tested on windows 7 and windows server 2012.
