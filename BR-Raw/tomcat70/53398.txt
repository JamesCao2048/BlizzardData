53398 – Incorrect tag on XML response when calling 'manager/status?XML=true'

Manager Status XML Response
When calling 'manager/status?XML=true' on Tomcat Server the XML response includes incorrect 'requestBytesRecieved' attributes on some '<worker>' nodes.
Attribute should read 'requestBytesReceived'.
 Seems like a typo when generating the 'requestBytesReceived' attribute for some nodes (Recieved != Received).
Error can be generated using the CURL command to get the Tomcat status response:
curl "http://<tomcat-server-address>/manager/status?XML=true" --basic -u <user>
(This assumes a user has already been defined with the proper privileges to access the status API command).
