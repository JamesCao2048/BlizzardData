50667 – Tribes | RpcChannel | Add a callback for cases when an error occured sending a reply to an RP call
The RpcChannel API user registers an RpcCallback to be notified of
communication events.
However, there is no callback method for the case where
the sending of a response message fails.
This entry proposes the addition of a callback method for such cases.
CAVEAT: this proposal modifies the RpcCallback interface.
RpcCallback is currently implemented by at least four tomcat classes, EchoRpcTest in org.apache.catalina.tribes.demos, and AbstractReplicatedMap, ReplicatedMap ad LazyReplicatedMap in org.apache.catalina.tribes.tipis.
The attached patch does not include the implementation of the additional interface method for those classes, as this coder did not feel qualified to tell how it should be implemented.
They could probably simply be NOOPs, however.
