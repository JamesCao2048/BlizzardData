60043 – suspectTimeout does not work as expected without removeAbandoned="true" which does not match its documentation
Already posted this to the mailinglist here:
http://tomcat.10.x6.nabble.com/Question-about-suspectTimeout-property-of-pool-configuration-possible-Bug-does-only-work-with-removed-td5054070.html
If you configure the pool to have:
logAbandoned="true"
suspectTimeout="120"
set it does not report leaked connections even if you got leaked connections hanging in the busy queue.
To me this looks like a bug.
Docs tell this:
Similar to to the removeAbandonedTimeout value but instead of treating
the connection as abandoned, and potentially closing the connection,
this simply logs the warning if logAbandoned is set to true.
Looking at the code however the suspect() method of a connection is only called from the PoolCleaner thread in the "checkAbandoned()" method.
But before calling that one it does check the pool configuration like this:
if (pool.getPoolProperties().isRemoveAbandoned())
pool.checkAbandoned();
but i don't want to configure removeAbandoned to true - i just want to get the suspect working like expected from reading the documentation of the property without actually removing the leaked connections.
Imho this needs to be changed - either the condition here is extended to look for suspectTimeout or the suspect is called in an extra method - i don't care which one is used ;).
