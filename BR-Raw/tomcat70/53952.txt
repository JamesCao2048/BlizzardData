53952 – Add support for TLS 1.1 and 1.2
Created attachment 29433 [details]
patch for tomcat trunk that adds support for newer TLS versions
It would be nice to have support for newer versions of TLS protocol.
Due to BEAST attack, the only usable ciphersuites supported by TLS version 1.0 are those based on RC4.
I'll attach compile-tested patches for both tcnative and tomcat.
