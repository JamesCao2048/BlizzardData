54521 – DigestAuthenticator: nonceCountValid() fails in case of simultaneous asynchronous requests of the same client
Concerned components:
org.apache.catalina.authenticator.DigestAuthenticator
org.apache.catalina.authenticator.DigestAuthenticator.NonceInfo
Scenario:
A multithreaded client sends two requests within one millisecond.
The DigestAuthenticator creates for each request a nonce as well as a NonceInfo instance.
The two nonces are equal, as they were created within the same millisecond.
When writing data into the cache (method generateNonce()), the second NonceInfo instance overwrites the first one (same key!).
Problem:
The two client threads then send a second request with a digest authentication header.
In both requests, â€œncâ€? (nonce count) is equal â€œ1â€?, as the nonce has been newly created.
In the NonceInfo of the first request, array â€œseenâ€? is set to â€œtrueâ€? for index ((nonceCount + offset) % seen.length).
In the second request the same NonceInfo instance is used, as the instance is retrieved from map â€œnoncesâ€? using â€œnonceâ€? as a key, that is, in both requests the same key is used.
Consequently, method â€œnonceCountValid()â€œ returns â€žfalseâ€œ, as  seen[(nonceCount + offset) % seen.length)] has already been set to â€žtrueâ€œ.
 Therefore the authentication fails, although the client has sent a valid digest authentication header.
Conclusion:
Working with multi-threaded clients with many requests, digest authentication does not function reliably.
