51099 – SPNEGO loginConfigName does not work
As reported by fhanik on the dev list:
2.
com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.accept is not configurable
While the authenticator has the attribute loginConfigName, there seems to be a place in the code where it omits this entry.
renaming this entry in jaas.conf and setting the loginConfigName will fail to validate a ticket
The problem code is here:
gssContext = manager.createContext(manager.createCredential(null,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
new Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.2"),
GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY));
should look like
final GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();
final PrivilegedExceptionAction<GSSCredential> action =
new PrivilegedExceptionAction<GSSCredential>() {
public GSSCredential run() throws GSSException {
return manager.createCredential(null,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
new Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.2"),
GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);
}
};
gssContext = manager.createContext(Subject.doAs(lc.getSubject(), action));||
