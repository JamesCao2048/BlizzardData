Close InputStream after use.
Factor out common code into a private method.
InputStreams are not closed after using them for loading the content into properties.
This happens a few times in the code base and seems to be a common task.
Maybe we should create a utility-method to capsulate that funtion.
For DefaultInstanceManager I have created a private method.
For ContextConfig I adapted to local logic only.
