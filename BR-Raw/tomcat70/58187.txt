58187 – Tomcat manager incorrect deployment status
When using the manager to deploy a war file (using html or text version of the manager), the response sent from the tomcat manager appears before the application ends its starting.
It appears after deployment but before application's context is fully up.
That means if the application fails in its start process, Tomcat manager will already have answered that the application has been deployed.
It was not the case with Tomcat 7.0.61.
It affects versions 7.0.63, and 7.0.62 of the Tomcat manager.
The parameters used are:
- war file located on server (/home/xxx.war),
- update = true,
- simple context (my-context)
Maybe the response has become asynchronous when Tomcat manager is deploying war file ?
It would be very strange since the reload is not asynchronous in all Tomcat versions.
