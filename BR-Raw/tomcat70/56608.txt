56608 – WatchedResource configured in $TomcatHome\conf\Catalina\localhost context XML file not triggering context reload after working for several days
Created attachment 31700 [details]
Log files for the day the error occurred and context reloading stopped being automatic.
 Context file for app in question included.
I have set up a context XML file within $TOMCAT_HOME\conf\Catalina\localhost which has a docbase on a network fileshare.
 I have set up a WatchedResource for a handful of files on this fileshare so that whenever one of the files is updated, the context is refreshed.
 This works fine for sometime, but after a while, I see an error in the logs saying "java.io.IOException: The semaphore timeout period has expired" (Log file with full stack trace is uploaded).
After we notice this error, I had to start the context back via the Tomcat manager (to be expected, since it appears that a short network unavailability caused the issue).
 However, once the application is started manually, the WatchedResources being updated no longer force the context to reload.
 We have to reload the context manually until we do a full restart of the Tomcat service.
