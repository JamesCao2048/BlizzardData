50222 – JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener should speculatively cause memory leaks using the system ClassLoader
JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener intentionally invokes methods known to pin the context ClassLoader in memory in order to avoid having a WebappClassLoader unintentionally pin itself.
This may cause undesirable behavior in embedded environments.
Instead, JMLPL could use a security context to temporarily set the current context ClassLoader to be the system ClassLoader and solve the embedded situation without the client having to remember to take this care.
