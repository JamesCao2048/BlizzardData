50230 – Recursive dependency between the tomcat-catalina-ha and tomcat-catalina
From the pom file of tomcat-catalina-ha, it depends on the tomcat-catalina.
But one class HTMLManagerServlet in the tomcat-catalina has a reference to a class BackupManager in the tomcat-catalina-ha.
 Is there a way to remove the recursive dependency between those two components ?
By the way, there mightbe a NullPointerException issue while using the BackupManager in the HTMLManagerServlet.
---> line.523
Manager manager = ctxt.getManager();
if (manager instanceof BackupManager && showProxySessions) {
args[5] = new Integer(
((BackupManager)manager).getActiveSessionsFull());
} else if (ctxt.getManager() != null){
args[5] = new Integer(manager.getActiveSessions());
} else {
args[5] = new Integer(0);
}
