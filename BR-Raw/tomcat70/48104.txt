48104 – the javadoc of class 'org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina' is not complete, as in the usage() method
Below is the javadoc of class 'org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina':
/**
* Startup/Shutdown shell program for Catalina.
 The following command line
* options are recognized:
* <ul>
* <li><b>-config {pathname}</b> - Set the pathname of the configuration file
*     to be processed.
 If a relative path is specified, it will be
*     interpreted as relative to the directory pathname specified by the
*     "catalina.base" system property.
  [conf/server.xml]
* <li><b>-help</b> - Display usage information.
* <li><b>-stop</b> - Stop the currently running instance of Catalina.
* </u>
*
* Should do the same thing as Embedded, but using a server.xml file.

*/
However, it doesn't allude the '-nonmaing' option, and 'start' option.
Below is the usage() method of the same class:
/**
* Print usage information for this application.
*/
protected void usage() {
System.out.println
("usage: java org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina"
+ " [ -config {pathname} ]"
+ " [ -nonaming ] { start | stop }");
}
It is not complete either.
It lacks the '-help' option.
