50680 – NPE in TagFileProcessor when tag file is in an expanded directory "jar"
Created attachment 26570 [details]
Patch against current trunk to add a null check to TagFileProcessor
When using VirtualDirContext, or the equivalent in the Web Tools Tomcat support, an expanded directory can be used in place of a jar file.
 In this case, tag files in the directory's META-INF folder will result in an NPE because the jarResource obtained from the TldLocation is null.
