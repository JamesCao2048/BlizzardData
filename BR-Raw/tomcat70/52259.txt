52259 – synchonization issues and dead lock if no realm is presented in configuration
Problem:
Tomcat 7.0.23 startup freezes at "INFO: Deploying web application directory ..."
Nuances:
- no errors are displayed in logs
- tomcat process can't be shutted down with shutdown.sh script
- http request on 80 port wait forever
- it's a multi host configuration
- the same setup works well on all previous build, including 7.0.22
- when lib/*.jar files of tomcat-7.0.23 are replaced with lib/*.jar files of tomcat-7.0.23 - everything works just fine
fix it asap!
thank you!
