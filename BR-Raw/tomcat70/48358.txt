48358 – JSP-unloading reloaded
Created attachment 24684 [details]
Patch including tests that fixed the problem for us.
Currently Tomcat does not support unloading JSPs.
When constantly changing and reloading JSP files (especially during development time) this causes the JVM to run out of memory.
The patch fixes this problem by tracking the last time a JSP page was requested.
Objects are destroyed if a configurable number of JSPs is live, starting with the "oldest" ones.
This behaviour is deactivated by default.
It must be configured explicitly.
The patch comes with tests that check the added functionality.
To make testing easier I added easymock as dependency to the classpath.
I'd appreciate any feedback on the code changes - suggestions for improvement, potential problems with the code etc.
This work was done in collaboration with some of my colleagues at work.
I will forward a link to this bug entry to those involved so they can provide more information on the background of the patch if needed.
On a side note: Just in case you might like to include the patch - I couldn't find a "patch intended for inclusion" check box (like the one in jira) in bugzilla - thus stating explicitly: License to ASF granted for inclusion in ASF works (as per the Apache License Â§5).
