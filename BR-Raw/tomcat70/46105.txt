46105 – URIEncoding doesn't affect after form-authentication redirect
How to reproduce bug.
Configure tomcat connector with URIEncoding=UTF-8 attribute.
Make a simple page that write out any request parameter.
Configure this page as protected with form-based authentication.
Try to access page, e.g.
/site/page.jsp?q=%xx%yy%zz%tt
where q=%xx%yy%zz is value in UTF-8 charset.
When page is being accessed for the first time, then after authentication, parameter "q" is incorrectly interpreted (it seems as it was in ISO8859-1 or anything else, but not UTF-8).
But subsequent access to the _same_ URI, i.e.
/site/page.jsp?q=%xx%yy%zz%tt
gives perfect result.
I also tried useBobyEncodingForURI=true and request.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") - nothing is changed.
