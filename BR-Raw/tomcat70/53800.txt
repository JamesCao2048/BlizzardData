53800 – Infinte loop cause by FileDirContext in a CDI/Weld project when using Eclipse's "Server modules without publishing"
Created attachment 29302 [details]
Patch for FileDirContext.java
Weld's TomcatListener is using the recurse method recited below.
In the case I am encountering the DirContext that Tomcat provides is a FileDirContext.
The discovery code used by Weld encounters what appears to be a bug in FileDirContext where FileDirContexts for child directories are created with the current FileDirContext's path.
This causes an infinite loop while it searches the root directory over and over.
Assuming the class discovery code Weld is using is correct, I tracked down the problem to a specific line in FileDirContext.java.
 Fixing this line to set the path of the new child FileDirContext to the matching child directory fixes the issue I am encountering.
With this change the project appears to still pass all the unit tests ran with "ant test".
I have attached the patch to this issue.
Here is Weld's recurse function which I am assuming is correct...
protected static void recurse(DirContext context, Set<String> classes, Set<URL> urls, String prefix) throws Exception {
if (prefix.length() > 0)
prefix += ".";
NamingEnumeration ne = context.listBindings("");
while (ne.hasMoreElements()) {
Binding next = (Binding) ne.nextElement();
String name = prefix + next.getName();
if (name.endsWith(".class")) {
classes.add(name.substring(0, name.length() - 6));
continue;
}
Object nextObject = next.getObject();
if (nextObject instanceof DirContext) {
recurse((DirContext) nextObject, classes, urls, name);
}
}
}
