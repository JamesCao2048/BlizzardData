51212 – QueryStats has synchornisation issues
Created attachment 27017 [details]
Patch with Atomic approach
Hello,
I don't know if it is volontary but I think QueryStats fields should be Atomic because they are accessed by multiple threads at same time.
I made a Load test with heavy load and collected results of SlowQueryReport and I get Sql queries with 0 as number of executions which is wrong as they have been executed at least once.
By the way I don't know which approach will perform better:
- synchronize add/failure
- Use Atomic
Maybe you did this for performance reasons.
