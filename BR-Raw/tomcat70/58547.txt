58547 – Avoid new Integer and new Long instances when doing conversions
Created attachment 33219 [details]
Replaced new Integer/Long with valueOf calls
Discovered cases where an inefficient Number constructor is being called instead of the static valueOf.
Using new Integer(int) is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas Integer.valueOf(int) allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM.
Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster.
