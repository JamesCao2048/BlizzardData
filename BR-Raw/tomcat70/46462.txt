46462 – JSPWiki JSP compilation prevented by org.apache.jasper.Constants.JSP_PACKAGE_NAME
Hi,
JSPWiki is currently an Incubator project at Apache.
We intend to use the package name org.apache.jspwiki.
However, any classes in this package tree fail to load when imported into a JSP page, specifically during Jasper's attempt to compile it.
For example,
<%@ page import="org.apache.jspwiki.WikiPage" %>
does not compile.
My colleague Harry Metske traced the cause to this line in org.apache.jasper.servlet.JasperLoader:
if( !name.startsWith(Constants.JSP_PACKAGE_NAME) ) {
// Class is not in org.apache.jsp, therefore, have our
// parent load it
clazz = parent.loadClass(name);
if( resolve )
resolveClass(clazz);
return clazz;
}
The recommended bug fix would be to append a period (".") to the expression passed into name.startsWith(), which in this case would then evaluate to "org.apache.jsp.", and allow JSPWiki classes to load and compile.
This issue is important for us as we emerge from incubation.
Lack of a fix means that JSPWiki cannot release under the desired package name "org.apache.jspwiki."
