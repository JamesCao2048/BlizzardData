52999 – Performance issue with locking in ContainerBase.fireContainerEvent()

I confirm that I see fireContainerEvent() calls in many places in StandardSession.
Moreover those are two nested loops:  a loop in StandardSession over array
of context.getApplicationEventListeners(); x copying the list of container listeners inside into array in context.fireContainerEvent().
I cannot confirm reported problem with request attributes - I do not see anything in the code that would send events from that access.
Is it possible to solve it with a ReadWriteLock?
Or it would be better to have a helper class that avoids copying the array over on every access (the said copy-on-write one)?
I classify this as an enhancement request.
