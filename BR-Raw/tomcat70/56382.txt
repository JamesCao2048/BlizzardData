56382 – Add logging of deployment time
Tomcat logs the start of the deployment directory, but doesn't log finish.
I've created the small patch, which logs when the particular deployment is finished, with the deployment time.
So output will be like this:
Apr 10, 2014 4:26:17 PM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory
INFO: Deploying web application directory C:\AAA\Tools\apache-tomcat-7.0.52\webapps\aaa-admin
....
Apr 10, 2014 4:31:10 PM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployDirectory
INFO: Deployment of web application directory C:\AAA\Tools\apache-tomcat-7.0.52\webapps\aaa-admin has finished in 292,516 ms.
