44223 – Tomcat ignores the "javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType" system property
Set up a SSL Connector with a keystore in JKS format:
<Connector ...
SSLEnabled="true"
keystoreFile="tomcat.keystore" keystoreType="JKS">
Let's say you need a custom truststore (e.g.
for authenticating self-signed
client certificates), and that this truststore is also needed by some of your
webapps, not only Tomcat.
The natural thing to do then is to configure this
truststore globally for the whole JVM, not in server.xml.
Let's also assume this truststore is in a different format (e.g.
PKCS#12).
So
before starting Tomcat, you do this:
export JAVA_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=trusted.keystore -
Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=PKCS12"
Well, it doesn't work.
If you look at tomcat/logs/catalina.out, you will see a
keystore-related exception.
Upon further debugging, you will discover the
problem is that Tomcat is trying to open the truststore as if it were in JKS
format, even though it is clearly specified as type PKCS12 in JAVA_OPTS above.
