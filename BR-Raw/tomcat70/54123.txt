54123 – servlet 3.0 spec violation in async timeout processing
Created attachment 29575 [details]
test war file within java source
Servlet 3.0 Spec.
says that
2.3.3.3 Asynchronous processing
...
In the event that an asynchronous operation times out, the container must run
through the following steps:
â–  Invoke the AsyncListener.onTimeout method on all the AsyncListener
instances registered with the ServletRequest on which the asynchronous
operation was initiated.
â–  If none of the listeners called AsyncContext.complete() or any of the
AsyncContext.dispatch methods, perform an error dispatch with a status
code equal to HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.
â–  If no matching error page was found, or the error page did not call
AsyncContext.complete() or any of the AsyncContext.dispatch
methods, the container MUST call AsyncContext.complete().
(servlet-3_0-mrel-spec.pdf / pdf page 40, Spec page 18)
In other words, if there are no AsyncListeners which calls AsyncContext.complete() or any of the
AsyncContext.dispatch, the container must perform an error dispatch with 500 error code.
But tomcat 7 does not send 500 error response.
It sends 200 OK.
In org.apache.catalina.core.AsyncContextImpl.timeout(),
if (listenerInvoked) {
request.getCoyoteRequest().action(
ActionCode.ASYNC_IS_TIMINGOUT, result);
return !result.get();
} else {
// No listeners, container calls complete
complete();
}
it just calls complete().
So I think it must be spec violation.
I've attached the test war file within a test source.
Test URL is http://localhost:8080/asyncTimeoutTest/AsyncTimeoutTestServlet .
