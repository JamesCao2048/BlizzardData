51905 – Infinite loop when shutting down AprEndpoint
If unlocking the acceptor during AprEndpoint shutdown fails, it enters an infinite loop, printing endpoint.warn.unlockAcceptorFailed message
(Acceptor thread [{0}] failed to unlock.
Forcing hard socket shutdown.)
It was reported on users@ mailing lists,
http://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/xo2jolyr44ijuu34
It might be caused by a firewall preventing Tomcat from connecting to its own HTTP port.
I can reproduce it if I turn the unlockAccept() method in endpoint into an noop (e.g.
by adding "if(true){ return; }"), both in 6.0 and in trunk.
In 6.0 this bug was introduced in r1065945 and affects 6.0.32 and 6.0.33.
