47866 – NullPointerException in embedded tomcat
It seems that the WebappClassLoader was stopped?

Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException

All I did was launch a server add a context and then ask it to load a resource from its classpath.
 It's a bit more complicated than that, so I'll try and narrow it down if needed.
