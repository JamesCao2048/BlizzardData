50928 – [patch] JSSESocketFactory - wrong password in KeyManagerFactory.init
Created attachment 26768 [details]
Patch to fix problem
JSSESocketFactory does not use the keyPass when calling KeyManagerFactory.init()
Attached patch fixes the error.
However, it might be better to fix up the handling of keyPass and keyStorePass defaults in the AbstractEndPoint super-class.
Patch also fixes a throw clause to ensure that the true cause of the exception is reported.
