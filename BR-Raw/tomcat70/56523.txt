56523 – SPNEGO auth failures are leading to stack trace prints of PrivilegedActionExceptions
Created attachment 31620 [details]
GNU Unified diff format of proposed fix
In the event of a privilegedactionexception in SpnegoAuthenticator, the error is always logged.
Hence the stack trace of the error always appears in catalina.out.
This leads to spurious logs even when debugging is not enabled
In the event of GSSException, its logged only when debugging is enabled.
It is imperative to note that The privilegedactions are AcceptAction and action both of which only have the capacity to throw GSSException.
Hence I am suggesting a fix which logs privileged action exception only when debugging is enabled in tomcat.
This is added as an attachment and is a unified diff of the SpnegoAuthenticator before and after the change.
Please let me know if you have any doubts about the fix or if you need a sample catalina.out highlighting the problem.
