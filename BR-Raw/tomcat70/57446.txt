57446 – Catalina presents a wrapped ServletContext in de-init phase to application listeners
JSF Applications (Mojarra 2.2.x) fail to shutdown properly, because Catalina presents a wrapped ServletContext (NoPluggabilityServletContext) in de-init phase (e.g.
stop webapp cmd issued via jmx).
The problem here is that the wrapped ServletContext (NoPluggabilityServletContext) does not appear to be "equal" (equals, etc.
methods not delegated) as the one in the init phase (start).
I filed a bug on the mojarra JIRA: https://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES-3687 but it was not accepted, because they argue this is a container issue.
Maybe a workaround could fix it for context "comparing" webapps.
In this case the mojarra implementation uses a List (CopyOnWriteArrayList) to match (contains) if the ServletContext has been initialized.
So a delegation of the "equals" method in the NoPluggabilityServletContext class could do the fix, but might cause other sideeffects in the container, which i didn't lookout.
A more detailed approach would be to get a light on the specification - what doues it say about the ServletContext instance and presented proxies in the application lifecycle.
