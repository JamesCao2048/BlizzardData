52731 – An incomplete fix for the resource leak bug in JDTCompiler.java
The fix revision 1043157 was aimed to remove an resource leak bug on the BufferedReader object "reader " (created in line 115), the FileInputStream object "is" (created in line 112) in the method "getContents()" of the file "/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/jasper/compiler/JDTCompiler.java" , but it is incomplete.
There are some problems:
1.
when "reader" is not created successfully but the temp InputStreamReader is created successfully at line 114, the temp InputStreamReader will be leaked.
The best way to close such resource objects is putting such close operations in the finaly block of a try-catch-finally structure.
