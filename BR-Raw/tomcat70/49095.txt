Patch to fix issue
org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint.unlockAccept does not wakeup accepts with deferred accept or BSD filters.
This is because it only connects to its connector for causing the accept call to return.
This is not enough in the case of a deferred accept / BSD filters as the accept call only returns from the kernel if data was sent / a HTTP request was sent.
The attached patch fixes that by sending and OPTIONS * in this case.
