52974 – NameNotFoundException is thrown when field/method is annotated with @Resource annotation
Created attachment 28500 [details]
Patch proposal
Hi,
I have a web application (attached) that has a Servlet with an annotated (@Resource) field and an annotated (@Resource) method.
When I request the Servlet I'm receiving:
javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Name test.TestServlet is not bound in this Context
org.apache.naming.NamingContext.lookup(NamingContext.java:820)
org.apache.naming.NamingContext.lookup(NamingContext.java:168)
org.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.invoke(AuthenticatorBase.java:472)
org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:98)
I searched the sources and found that org.apache.catalina.startup.WebAnnotationSet processes and prepares for binding only @Resource annotation on a class level.
However org.apache.catalina.core.DefaultInstanceManager tries to process @Resource annotation on field/method level and to inject the necessary Object.
Unfortunately as the information is not processed and bound in the naming previously, NameNotFoundException is thrown.
I would like to propose a patch (attached).
I'm looking forward to your comments.
Thanks in advance.
