57959 – Deadlock in FileHandler.java when log is rotated
Tomcat 7 will deadlock when a log file is rotated.
 This issue has been fixed in latest tomcat 6 and tomcat 8 but not in tomcat 7.
The issue is in following code (apache-tomcat-7.0.62-src/java/org/apache/juli/FileHandler.java:188)
} finally {
writerLock.writeLock().unlock();
// Down grade to read-lock.
This ensures the writer remains valid
// until the log message is written
writerLock.readLock().lock();
}
}
Despite the comment the order is wrong, you have to acquire a read lock then release write lock to make sure the race condition does not occur.
The correct way to do it is:
} finally {
writerLock.readLock().lock();
writerLock.writeLock().unlock();
}
}
In tomcat 6 (apache-tomcat-6.0.44-src/java/org/apache/juli/FileHandler.java:187) and tomcat 8 (apache-tomcat-8.0.22-src/java/org/apache/juli/FileHandler.java:186) the order is correct.
