50629 – Make the bindThread/unbindThread method protected
In the latest Tomcat codes, I saw that a new thread is created for listener start, filter start and loadOnStartup.
But the two methods bindThread and unbindThread is marked as private, how about making those methods protected ? So that other containers could use those two methods for their own initialization works.
Thanks.
