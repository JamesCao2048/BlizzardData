28852 – failonerror attribute on Ant tasks
failonerror boolean attribute on manager Ant tasks would be a nice have to
allow for more flexible operation within Ant build files.
I will attach a patch next week that also fixes unecessary CRs during response
read/print and missing url encoding in some tasks.
