47378 – welcome-file ignores servlet mapping
Web applications that use a servlet mapping for their welcome-file are ignored
and the server returns either a directory listing or a 404 if the listing is
disabled.
I have JSF servlet defined and a servlet-mapping for *.jsf to go to the
FacesServlet.
I have "index.jsf" listed as by welcome-file and I get a 404 with directory
listing disabled.
I also have a custom servlet defined with its mapping and set the welcome-file
to its mapping and get a 404 as well.
