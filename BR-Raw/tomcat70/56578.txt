56578 – session.invalidate does not work on cluster enabled webapps
session invalidate does not work in 7.0.54 when Tomcat is clustered.
7.0.53 is OK.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Use Clustered Tomcat, with the following added to the <Host/> in server.xml:
<Cluster className="org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.SimpleTcpCluster"/>
2.
Drop session.jsp and invalidate.jsp from attachments into a directory.
3.
Open session.jsp in a browser.
Note creation time.
4.
Refresh page and note creation time stays the same.
5.
Click on Invalidate and note that creation time is updated.
On Tomcat 7.0.53 all steps above succeed.
On Tomcat 7.0.54 step 5 fails.
