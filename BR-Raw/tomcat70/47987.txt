47987 – Out of memory being caused by notFoundResources in org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader
Guys
Tomcat 6.0.20, java 1.6, linux x64
org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader records every resource you asked
for that doesn't exist.
On our site we have alot of pages ( > 800,000 )
all of which are using struts2 with validation.
every hit means the validator does a request for a resource actionName-validation.xml
This then gets cached in the WebappClassLoader
about line 249
/**
* The list of not found resources.
*/
protected HashMap notFoundResources = new HashMap();
Can this be made into a weak hash map perchance ?
or something so that it won't invoke a out of memory.
I'm also looking at removing the validator from those urls
if anyone knows how to tell the validation interceptor that we don't use the xml files
and ONLY use annotations then that would be great :)
