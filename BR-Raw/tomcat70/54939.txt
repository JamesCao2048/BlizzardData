54939 – No useful logging when maxHeaderCount hit
Recent versions of tomcat 6 & 7 added the maxHeaderCount parameter to the connector configuration with a default value of 100.
When this limit is hit Tomcat returns a HTTP 400 response with a blank page and in the default configuration nothing is logged by the server.
The org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProcessor class logs the error at DEBUG level but that doesn't get written anywhere using the default configuration.
The use case for more than 100 headers is the use of SSO systems that provide user attributes via HTTP headers.
The Internet2 Shibboleth project is one good example, it is quite common to have well over 100 headers getting passed to Tomcat when using these systems.
I'd like to propose one of the following fixes:
- Write a message to the response explaining why the 400 response was returned.
This would make it much easier for application deployers to determine the cause of the non-functional application.
- Have a default logger setup for the AJP connector and change the log level to INFO.
Perhaps this gets treated as a one time warning and the first request that hits this limit is logged as WARN and the subsequent requests are logged at DEBUG to avoid log clutter.
- Increase the default value of maxHeaderCount to 1000 which would more easily accommodate the use of HTTP headers to pass user attributes.
I'd be happy to provide a patch for any of these solutions or other proposed ideas.
