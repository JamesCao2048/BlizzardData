51453 – Requests to open URL that include an Authorization header do not reach servlet
In Tomcat 7, I've noticed that a request to a URL that does not require authentication will get forwarded to the login page if the request contains an "Authorization" header.
Our application expects these requests to be processed by the servlet.
 The servlet parses the Authorization header and takes appropriate action (possibly redirecting to the login page or allowing the request if the headers contain an acceptible token).
 This has worked in older versions of Tomcat.
The relevant part of our web.xml looks like:
<security-constraint>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>open</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
<!-- several other url patterns -->
</web-resource-collection>
<user-data-constraint>
<transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
</user-data-constraint>
<!-- Notice no auth-constraint element -->
</security-constraint>
I observed the behavior of org.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.invoke(), here's what I saw:
The constraints variable contains a single constraint that matches the security constraint from our web.xml above.
On line 520, authRequired is set to true because of the presence of the Authorization header.
The authenticate() call on line 535 fails and redirects to the login page.
