52792 – Incomplete error message when lookup a resource that is not bound in the naming
Created attachment 28401 [details]
Patch proposal
Hi,
I have a servlet that specifies @Resource on a field level.
(see attached sample application)
When a request comes for this servlet, Tomcat tries to inject this resource and to instantiate the servlet.
If the resource is not found, 500 ISE is returned as a response code.
In the error message returned in the error page, it is not specified the full composite name that Tomcat tries to lookup, but only the first part (the context) (see incorrect.png).
Thus the end user cannot understand which is the resource that causes the problem, but only the context that cannot be found.
I would like to propose a patch (attached).
A screenshot (correct.png) with corrected error message is also attached.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Violeta Georgieva
