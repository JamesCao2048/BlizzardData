48998 – Proposal : port mod_expires in java as ExpiresFilter Servlet Filter
Created attachment 25189 [details]
Port of mod_expires as ExpiresFilter
Here is a proposal to port Apache Httpd mod_expires in java as ExpiresFilter, a standard Servlet Filter.
I detailed a standalone version on http://code.google.com/p/xebia-france/wiki/ExpiresFilter .
More over, I tried my best to provide very detailed javadocs and docs (in filter.html).
The proposed contribution is slightly different because it uses Tomcat logging, few Servlet 3 enhancements and test cases use Tomcat engine.
The attached patch contains :
* ExpiresFilter.java : the Expires Filter
* TestExpiresFilter : detailed test cases
* filter.xml : doc updates
The filter has been optimized using a profiler and stress tested with Apache Bench under high load.
