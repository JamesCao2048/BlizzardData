49116 – Memory leak by HttpSession.
When session is stored in StandardManager#doUnload method,
an invalid session is stored.
For instance,
If HttpSession#invalidate is executed while executing StandardManager#doUnload,
session of "isValid=false" is stored.
The session of isValid=false is restored in StandardManager#doLoad,
and it registers in session map (sessions).
However, no one can invalidate this session.
If isValid is false, StandardSession#invalidate() and StandardSession#isValid() can not expire session.
They are throws IllegalStateException or return immediately.
Consequently, the session of isValid=false is never deleted from the session map(sessions).
I made a patch.
If session is already invalid, expire session to prevent memory leak.
Best Regards.
