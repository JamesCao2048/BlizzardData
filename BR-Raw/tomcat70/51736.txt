51736 – Make rpcTimeout configurable in BackupManager.
Default rpcTimeout that BackupManager sets to AbstractReplicatedMap is 15000 msec.
This is not configurable.
When receiving MapMessage.MSG_START (and after a new member is added),
publishEntryInfo is called for all sessions where primary and backup node are not included.
And, the backup node is set to the session.
When only one Tomcat starts in cluster, publishEntryInfo will be called for all sessions.
As a result, the RPC message has the possibility of the timeout.
When acquiring session from restarting Tomcat,
warning of "Unable to retrieve remote object for key:XXX" is logged.
And the session cannot be continued.
I make rpcTimeout configurable in BackupManager.
Additionally, if RPC message timeouted in AbstractReplicatedMap#broadcast, add warning message.
Best Regards.
