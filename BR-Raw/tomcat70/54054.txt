54054 – 2 CGIServlet's with different Parameter passShellEnvironment
Created attachment 29511 [details]
2 webapps test1/test2.
I'm running Tomcat 6.0.36 with Java 1.6.0_32 on Ubuntu 12.04 (64 Bit).
I have 2 webapps test1 and test2 which use CGI with CGIServlet.
The difference between test1 and test2 is the Parameter passShellEnvironment.
test1 sets it to true, test2 to false.
When I call .../cgi-bin/getenv.pl, both apps show the complete environment.
I searched the source of CGIServlet and found, that there is a static
Hashtable:
static Hashtable<String,String> shellEnv = new Hashtable<String,String>();
So test1 sets this Hashtable and test2 has it too.
I suggest to remove the static.
Then only test1 has the environment.
In Tomcat 7.0.32 the problem is the same.
