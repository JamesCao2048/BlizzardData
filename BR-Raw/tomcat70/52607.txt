52607 – It is not well defined how "Dependencies on extensions" mechanism can be used in Tomcat
Hi,
As a result of the mail thread [1] I'm opening a bug.
In short it is not clear how exactly "Dependencies on extensions" mechanism can be used.
I have two proposals:
1.
Tomcat can continue to use in its implementation a separate property ("catalina.ext.dirs") that provides extensions' location.
But its value should be added by default to the Tomcat's classpath directories (e.g.
"shared.loader").
- Pros: Tomcat users will know that this property specifies the directory for their extensions and only the files located there will be scanned during ExtensionValidator.validateApplication invocation.
- Cons: Additional configuration that has to be maintained.
2.
Tomcat can remove this separate property ("catalina.ext.dirs") and start searching for such extensions in the Tomcat's classpath directories (e.g.
shared.loader).
- Pros: No additional configuration is needed.
One can specify the shared libraries and the extensions with one and the same property.
- Cons: During ExtensionValidator.validateApplication, it may appear that a lot of files are scanned which might be not necessary.
I'm willing to provide a patch once we agree on the solution.
My favourite is the first proposal.
I'm looking forward to your comments.
Thanks in advance.

Violeta Georgieva
