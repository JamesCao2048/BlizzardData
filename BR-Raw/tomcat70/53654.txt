53654 – JSP file is always recompiled for using file based TLD URL
Now, in Jasper codes, it only supports jar URL and relative URL, that may be enough for common web applications.
While, it is possible that the third-party uses other protocol URL, like file: protocol based URL.
So, the JSP files will be always recompiled for each access for the target page.
The codes are located in Compiler.isOutDated() method.
Is it possible to provide more generic handlering for the URL ?
