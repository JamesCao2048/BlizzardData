54536 – ErrorReportValve doesn't respect HttpServletResponse.sendError(int sc, String msg)
The changes of the ErrorSupportValve introduced in catalina-v7.0.30 does not respect HttpServletResponse.sendError(int sc, String msg)  because when a msg is provided with a status which is not present in the LocalStrings.properties of the 'org.apache.catalina.valves' package, the error page won't be forwarded to the response body.
This issue was triggered due to the following change which was performed at revision 1348777:
The change of the
report = sm.getString("http." + statusCode, message);
to
report = sm.getString("http." + statusCode);
results in 'report==null' for custom status codes returning a response without the error page body.
if (report == null) {
return;
}
