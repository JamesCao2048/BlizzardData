52547 – incorrect byeswritten log after completed async request under http1.0
AbstractHttp11Processor does not call nextRequest() if the socket will be closed because keepAlive=false (i.e.
http/1.0).
See line 1539 in
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc7.0.x/tags/TOMCAT_7_0_25/java/org/apache/coyote/http11/AbstractHttp11Processor.java
Presumably the recycle() caused by the socket close is expected to subsume the behaviour of nextRequest()
But in AbstractOutputBuffer recycle() does not have byteCount = 0, whereas nextRequest() does.
See lines 260, 280 in
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc7.0.x/tags/TOMCAT_7_0_25/java/org/apache/coyote/http11/AbstractOutputBuffer.java
The result is that the bytesWritten log of the following request will be incorrectly increased by the size of the async http/1.0 request
