48729 – JNDIRealm.java not parsing roles correctly
Created attachment 24972 [details]
small patch for JNDIRealm.java
According to the docs:
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/realm-howto.html
it says roles can be specified by both userRoleName, AND roleName
mechanisms.
But, if both are used then the result is that userRoleName roles are
excluded.
 I believe the correct approach is in the attached patch.
