53793 – Change webapp links in Manager to point to /appname/ instead of /appname
The first column of the table that lists Web Applications in Tomcat Manager webapp contains links to those applications, e.g.
<a href="/examples">/examples</a>
When the link is clicked and browser navigates to "/examples", it results in 302 redirect to "/examples/".
It would be better to change that link to point directly to "/examples/".
<a href="/examples/">/examples</a>
I am changing the link address only, but not the text on it.
That is because the "Path" of the web application displayed in that column (and used in Manager commands elsewhere) does not have the additional '/'.
