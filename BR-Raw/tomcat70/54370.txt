54370 – NPE mapping method in EL

Patch
NPE when using null parameters in some cases: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-3177
I did put a workaround for it, but I don't know how legitimate it is.
It looks a bit similar to the NPE with a null toString that got reverted, where a null object is used as an argument.
