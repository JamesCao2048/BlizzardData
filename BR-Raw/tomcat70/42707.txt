42707 – add host alias using jmx doesn't take affect until restart
Adding a host alias using jmx doesn't take affect until tomcat is restarted.
To test it I started tomcat using
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=6702
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
I created a webapps_test/test/index.html
I created a new host
<Host
appBase="webapps_test"
name="test.localdomain">
</Host>
I tested the url http://test.localdomain:8080/test/ and the index page showed up
as expected.
I used jconsole under Catalina/Host/test.localdomain/Operations/addAlias and
added test1.localdomain (I edited my /etc/hosts file to map test.localdomain and
test1.localdomain to 127.0.0.1).
I went to the url http://test1.localdomain:8080/test/ and instead of the
index.html page I received a 404 error.
I tried starting and stopping the host
from within jmx, it didn't help, I tried Catalina/Server/Operations/storeConfig
and starting and stopping the host and that didn't help either.
I tested with the following versions for the server
jdk 1.6.0_01-b06
tomcat 5.5.20, 6.0.10, 6.0.13
for the client I was using the jdk 1.6.0_01-b06 jconsole, as well as a custom
application I had written as well as the the "administration web application 5.5.23"
all the combinations above had similar results.
I will briefly mention that in tomcat 6.0.10/13 I was unable to save the
configuration due to an error :
Jun 20, 2007 5:26:11 PM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer storeConfig
SEVERE: StoreConfig mbean not registeredCatalina:type=StoreConfig
I will open a separate bug for that.
In tomcat 5 I was able to save the config.
If I restart tomcat5 after saving the config (using catalina.sh stop / start)
the new alias works properly.
Likewise, if I edit the tomcat 6 conf/server.xml and add the alias entry in
manually and restart tomcat, the url http://test1.localdomain:8080/test/ works fine.
So, the main problem is that adding an alias dynamically doesn't seem to work.
