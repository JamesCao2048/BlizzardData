50535 – Support resources serving from /WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/resources directory
Servlet 3.0 introduced the feature to serve static files from META-INF/resources directory.
The specification only demands support for this if the META-INF/resources is inside of a jar file in the /WEB-INF/lib directory.
Tomcat passes this requirement because it serves files from jar but not from WEB-INF/classes.
It seems Glassfish 3.0.1 however supports both type of locations.
It would be nice if Tomcat would support it too.
