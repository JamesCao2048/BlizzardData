54239 – Extensible EL Interpreter
Created attachment 29684 [details]
Interface of ELInterpreter
In some cases, applications need doing code generation for EL to make EL evaluation more faster.
It's better for tomcat to provide an extensible EL Interpreter.
So application can inject it's own ELInterpreter to replace the default JspUtil.interpreterCall.
Attached an implementation.
