43538 – [patch] Show the hostname and IP address in the manager webapp
We have an environment with a couple of load-balanced Tomcats fronted by httpd.
If someone accesses the manager application through the load-balancer, they will
not know which of the load-balanced Tomcats they end up at.
In these situations,
and others as well, it would be nice if the manager could tell the hostname and
IP address of the machine it is running on.
