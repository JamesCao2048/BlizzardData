56902 – DefaultServlet could leak resource in method copy - CID-45243

always close istream in DefaultServlet#copy
In method copy istream could be left unclosed, if write operations on ostream would throw an exception before copyRange is called.
A simple fix is to wrap the ostream-operations together with copyRange in a try-finally block.
If the exceptions should be catched into the variable exception like copyRange does, it could be done so in an additionally catch block (which is missing from the attached patch).
