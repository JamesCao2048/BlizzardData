53322 – Odd decapitalization when inferring JavaBean property from setter name for an injection target
There is code in DefaultInstanceManager class that converts a setter method name into JavaBean property name.
The code is wrong: it removes "set" prefix and then converts the first character into lowercase.
That is a wrong way to get JavaBeans property name.
The correct way would be to follow JavaBeans specification 1.01 ch.8.8 [1] and use java.beans.Introspector#decapitalize(String) method.
E.g.
for method setURL(..) the correct property name would be "URL", not "uRL".
