49299 – Servlet 3.0 ch.7.1.1 says that custom cookie name affects URL rewriting
Created attachment 25442 [details]
cookiename.war
In chapter 7.1.1 of servlet-3_0-final-spec.pdf it is said that
"If a web application configures a custom name for its session tracking cookies, the
same custom name will also be used as the name of the URI parameter if the session
id is encoded in the URL (provided that URL rewriting has been enabled)."
That is not true for the current trunk: the default "jsessionid" is used instead.
I am attaching a war file that reproduces this issue.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Deploy it as cookiename.war
2.
Access http://localhost:8080/cookiename/
3.
Actual result:
The page sends the following cookie:
Set-Cookie: MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F; Path=/cookiename; HttpOnly
but the Reload link on the page uses "jsessionid":
http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;jsessionid=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F
4.
Expected result: if that phrase in 7.1.1 is to be followed, I would expect the Reload link to be
http://localhost:8080/cookiename/index.jsp;MYSESSIONCOOKIE=658C60E714E9C7C833F4FDA366E0477F
