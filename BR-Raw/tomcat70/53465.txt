53465 – mapped-name is read when in @Resource, but not when in web.xml
Created attachment 28995 [details]
Patch proposal
Hi,
When I have the code below in a servlet
@Resource(mappedName="test")
private DataSource ds;
'mapped name' is read when @Resource is processed (org.apache.catalina.startup.WebAnnotationSet.addResource(WebAnnotationSet.java:377)) so later on it is available through Reference object as StringRefAddr
But when I have the declaration below in web.xml
<resource-ref>
<res-ref-name>datasource</res-ref-name>
<res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
<mapped-name>test</mapped-name>
</resource-ref>
'mapped name' is not read at all.
I would like to propose a patch that adds additional Rule to WebRuleSet so that 'mapped name' is process and set as property.
I'm looking forward to your comments.
Regards
Violeta Georgieva
