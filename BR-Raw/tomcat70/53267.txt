Increases timeout on sun.misc.GC.requestLatency in JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener
The JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener causes a full GC every hour when gcDaemonProtection=true.
The prevention technique invokes sun.misc.GC.requestLatency with a value of 360000.
 Increasing the value to Long.MAX_VALUE would be beneficial.
The attached patches add a default setting of Long.MAX_VALUE (add documentation update), but also permit it to be configured to a lower value using a System property.
