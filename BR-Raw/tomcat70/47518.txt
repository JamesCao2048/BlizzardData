47518 – Valve Interface Javadocs for invoke method references non-existent method
It appears that the Valve interface javadoc hasn't been updated since around TC 5.5.
Here is a snip of what it currently available from TC's website (6.0.20 I would guess):
"
# If the corresponding Response was not generated (and control was not returned, call the next Valve in the pipeline (if there is one) by executing context.invokeNext().
.
.
.
# Modify the HTTP headers included with the Response after the invokeNext() method has returned.
# Perform any actions on the output stream associated with the specified Response after the invokeNext() method has returned.
"
The invokeNext method has not existed in the Valve interface in many versions.
I believe the replacement is:
this.getNext().invoke(request, response)
I'm happy to provide a doc patch if getNext().invoke(request, response) is the expected replacement for invokeNext(request, response).
Note that the docs for 5.5 also have the same problem.
Please let me know if I should log that separately.
