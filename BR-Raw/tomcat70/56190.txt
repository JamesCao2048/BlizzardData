56190 – Connection keep-alive not working with asynchronous servlet
Created attachment 31346 [details]
AsyncHelloServlet.java
I am trying to use asynchronous servlets.
It looks like whenever you call request.startAsync() keep-alive is disabled and the response is sent in chunked transfer encoding.
I attached the code of a simple servlet.
I get these headers in the response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2014 13:25:29 GMT
With a regular blocking servlet I get:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Content-Length: 11
