49890 – Nio Selector issue on linux platform
Created attachment 25997 [details]
NioEndpoint.java and simple web application
sometimes ,server's cpu reaches 100%,and keep 100% all the time,until restart
the server.
Reproduced with java versions: 1.6.0_07,  1.6.0_18, 1.6.0_21.
It is duplicate of issue: Bug 46373.
It seams that Jetty guys fixed that problem: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-937?focusedCommentId=168060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel.
I added some logging to NioEndpoint.java.
With this logging we can see that selector.select(timeout) sometimes return zero keys on linux plutform.
And it is never reproduced on windows platform.
In the attach:
NioEndpoint.7z - patched NioEndpoint.java (with logging)
web.7z - simple web application.
To reproduce jvm bug we should do several requests(we can just press F5 in browser and hold button) to web application.
