52055 – ChunkedInputFilter is not recycled for servlet 3.0 asynchronous request
I'm using the standard servlet 3.0 async APIs with tomcat 7.0.22.
The server side code is something like the following:
final AsyncContext asyncContext = request.startAsync();
...
// in a processing thread
asyncContext.getRequest().getInputStream();
...
read the input stream
asyncContext.complete();
The InputStream returns 0 bytes for the HTTP post with chunking.
After debugging, I found that the ChunkedInputFilter is reused by org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractInputBuffer.
But it has never been recycled (nextRequest()?) before the reuse for another request.
As a result, the endChunk flag is always true after the first request.
And it always return immediately without reading more from the buffer.
