43819 – Support latest JSR245 proposal to make EL "self-contained"
Please add the two static methods ExpressionFactory.newInstance(..) as described
in http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr245/245-MR1.html.
These changes make the EL "self-contained" and allow to plug-in third party EL
implementations like JUEL (http://juel.sf.net).
