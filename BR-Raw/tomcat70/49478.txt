49478 – Add encoding parameter to AddDefaultCharSetFilter
AddDefaultCharSetFilter adds a default charset to each request.
It assumes ISO-8859-1 as the default charset.
The attached patch makes it configurable by introducing an "encoding" parameter.
This parameter can take one of two special values "default" or "system".
Every other value will be interpreted as a name of an character set, e.g "utf-8".
The meaning of the two special values are as follows:
default: use ISO-8859-1.
This value will also be used, if no parameter was specified, or if it is empty
system: the jvm will be asked for the default charset.
This charset will usually be set by system locale.
Together with this functional change, there are two minor changes and one bigger changes hidden.
First use of annotation "Override" at overriden methods.
Second use of keyword "static" for the ResponseWrapper, since it has no reference to outer class.
The third and somewhat bigger change is use of HttpServletResponse#setCharacterEncoding(encoding) instead of manipulating the content-type.
