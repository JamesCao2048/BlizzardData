40551 – Sticky sessions using PersistentManager enter indeterminate state on node failover
If a cluster of nodes is being load balanced with sticky sessions, and a
particular node becomes unavailable, any sessions bound to that node must be
redistributed.
 Particularly in the case of mod_jk these sessions will not be
bound to whichever node the failover occurred on because the jessionid will
still contain the JVM route of the original failed node, thus placing the
session in an indeterminate state and losing sticky properties.
I am attaching a patch that will trigger a session to rebind itself to a new
node if the jvmroutes don't match and replace the jessionid in the browser's cookie.
