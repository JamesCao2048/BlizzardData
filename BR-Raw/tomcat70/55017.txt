55017 – Ability to configure RMI bind address
Created attachment 30319 [details]
Patch to provider bind rmi bind address setup ability
There is a patch which adds rmiBindAddress property to JmxRemoteLifecycleListener, which allows to bind RMI server to specific interface instead of 0.0.0.0.
It may useful for binding RMI to localhost and avoiding firewall configuration (and then monitoring through SSH tunnel).
Unfortunatly using of rmiBindAddress incompatible with rmiSSL, but i think it's not an issue because of rarely intersecting use cases.
