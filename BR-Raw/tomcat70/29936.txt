29936 – XML parser loading problems by container
I'm trying to use JSTL 1.1 with this version of tomcat and have both saxon and
crimson in my web-app.
If we have crimson and saxon in our webapp lib then tomcat tries to use crimson
as the xml parser when reading the web.xml and compiling the jsp and we get the
prefix error:
org.apache.jasper.JasperException: <h3>Validation error messages from
TagLibraryValidator for c</h3><p>null: java.lang.IllegalStateException: can't
declare any more prefixes in this context</p><h3>Validation error messages from
TagLibraryValidator for fmt</h3><p>null: java.lang.IllegalStateException: can't
declare any more prefixes in this context</p>
If we remove crimson, tomcat uses saxon (aelfred parser) and this fails on
reading the web.xml (javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException: AElfred
parser is namespace-aware)
If we remove saxon and crimson then we are okay (defaults to xerces in the
tomcat endorsed directory?)
It seems to me that tomcat is using the parser in my web-app to read the
web.xml rather than using xerces from the endorsed directory.
The same web-app runs without problems in version 5.0.16.
Tomcat seems to be using the service provider mechanism in 5.0.25 as I have
property files in C:\Java\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.25
\work\Catalina\localhost\diabetes\loader\META-INF\services (can't find any
documents on this).
If I'm using more than one parser won't this cause problems as tomcat is
setting only one parser and xslt processor here?
Any comments are gratefully received.
Thanks,
