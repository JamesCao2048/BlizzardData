50273 ñ AprEndpoint logs socket accept fails altough error is harmless
I use the above Tomcat on my HP-UX 11.23 system.
I have compiled libtcnative 1.1.20 successfully.
Tomcat is spamming my log files with this error message:
5.11.2010 09:06:29 org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint$Acceptor run
SCHWERWIEGEND: Socket accept failed
org.apache.tomcat.jni.Error: Kein Pufferplatz verf√ºgbar
at org.apache.tomcat.jni.Socket.accept(Native Method)
at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint$Acceptor.run(AprEndpoint.java:1169)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
In English: No buffer space available.
I googled for the problem and this out:

This bug occurs with the IE6 & IE8 on our setup.
I wasn't able to filter this our with java logging, it simple ignored loading my filter.
Searching the APR docs I found this: http://dev.ariel-networks.com/apr/apr-tutorial/html/apr-tutorial-13.html Section "Detection of the remote host closed the socket"
The error seems to be harmless, a debug or info would satisfy here but in the level severe it simply spams my disk.
Is there a way to fix that according to the APR docs? I have no clue in C.
