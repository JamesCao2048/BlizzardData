43117 – Dangerousness of workDir setting on Context
Hi, I'd like to point out the dangerousness of workDir setting on Context.
If workDir is an empty string, i.e.
workDir=AA, then workDir will be set as
CATALINA_HOME.
Therefore if application will be reloaded, then the files in CATALINA_HOME will
be deleted.
I know this problem is caused by wrong configuration, but it is too dangerous,
anyway.
I propose a patch.
