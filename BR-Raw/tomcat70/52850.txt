52850 – Various miscellaneous fixes to Tomcat Memory Leak Detection code
Problem Description -
----------------------
Tomcat memory leak detection has the following issues
- Most of the detection and fixing code has been tested ONLY on Sun JVMs.
A lot of  the reflection based code does not work with the IBM JDK.
- Tests in tomcat7.source\test\org\apache\catalina\loader do not seem to run successfully and are incomplete for all the protection that Tomcat provides for classloader memory leaks.
- For some categories of threadlocal memory leaks the key and value are not displayed correctly in the warning messages; particularly ones dealing with indirect references to threadlocals
-  org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadedByThisOrChild(Object) incorrectly traverses the object classloader hierarchy instead of the current (this) classloader hierarchy
Problem Conclusion -
--------------------
- After extensive testing with the IBM JDKs, I have cleaned up and sanitized some of the reflection code to stop executors, timers, threads etc on the IBM JDK
- Added new tests for detecting threadlocal leaks and thread leaks
- Better ThreadLocal leak reporting with corrected loadedByThisOrChild method and addition of expungeStaleEntries method
- Make code more resilient in certain leak detection scenarios.
