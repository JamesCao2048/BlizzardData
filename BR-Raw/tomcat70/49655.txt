49655 – ExpressionFactoryImpl.createMethodExpression() is not EL 2.2 Spec conform
org.apache.el.ExpressionFactoryImpl.createMethodExpression(ELContext context,
String expression, Class expectedReturnType, Class[] expectedParamTypes)
does not correctly impl EL Specification 2.2 (Maintenance Release 2 - December
10, 2009)
The spezfication say at site 72 (last paragraph):
expectedParamTypes - The expected parameter types for the method to be found.
Must be an array with no elements if there are no parameters expected.
It is
illegal to pass null, unless the method is specified with arugments in the EL
expression, in which case these arguments are used for method selection, and
this parameter is ignored.
The part ", unless the method is specified...." was added in 2.2 and is not
implemented.
If i call the method with expectedParamTypes == null i get NullPointerException,
although expression #{bean.sayHello('World')} has arguments.
The Sun 2.2.1-b04 el (com.sun.el.ExpressionFactoryImpl) has the same defect.
The
code looks identical.
JUEL 2.2.1 (http://juel.sourceforge.net/) works fine.
