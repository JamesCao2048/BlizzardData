54660 – AccessLogValve fileDateFormat can not be changed through JMX
When an AccessLogValve is added to a catalina host with the JMX addVale() operation on the Host object name, the valve will start with the default fileDateFormat.
Changing the attribute on the valve through it's JMX object name has no effect because the valve is already started.
Executing a rotate() operation on the valve does also have no effect.
Steps to Reproduce:
- Start tomcat server
- Add Host using JMX
- Add valve to Host using JMX
- Set valve attribute fileDateFormat to something else than yyyy-MM-dd, for example yy-MM
Actual Results:
The access log file format will include the default fileDateFormat of yyyy-MM-dd
Expected Results:
The access log file format with yy-MM, as from the example.
