47774 – Illegal context class loader is used when HttpSessionListener is executed.
When HttpSessionListener is executed, illegal class loader is set to the context classLoader.
I think that the problem is in CoyoteAdapter#parseSessionCookiesId method.
JSESSION COOKIE is parsed in this method, and sessionId is set to the request.
To check sessionId, Request#isRequestedSessionIdValid method is called in this method.
And, Session#isValid() might be called in Request#isRequestedSessionIdValid method.
However, the context class loader of a current thread is StandardClassLoader.
It is not WebappClassLoader.
For instance,
When the session has already passed session-timeout,
Session#expire is executed.
At this time, the context class loader of the thread that executes HttpSessionListenner#sessionDestroyed is StanderdClassLoader.
This is not good.
The context class loader of the thread that executes HttpSessionListenner should be WebAppClassLoader.
Best regards.
