43001 – JspC lacks setMappedFile and setDie for use in Ant task
The output files of the task (which defaults to false) will differ vs.
what is
generated at runtime with the web.xml 'mappedfile' parameter set true.
 I just
did a quick check and 'die' seemed to be the only other option that was
missing that might make sense in the task.
 These also occur in all versions
of Tomcat and might be ported to 5.x.
