45618 – Selector is not closed.
In the class ParallelNioSender [1], a Selector (selector) is declared as a field.
In line 60, it is opened (selector = Selector.open()).
However, it is not closed in any situations.
As shown by its Javadoc [2], it has a close() method, and this method should be called to close the selector.
