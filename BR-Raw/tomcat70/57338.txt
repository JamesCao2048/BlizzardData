57338 – SingleSignOnEntry cache of ClusterSingleSignOn valve is not synchronized on Tomcat startup
When using the ClusterSingleSignOn valve, it looks like the single sign on session state is not synchronized to cluster nodes when they start.
The state is instead only replicated at the moment that an action is performed, so any nodes that come online after that action are out of sync.
