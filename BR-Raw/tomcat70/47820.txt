47820 – Static utility methods in Tomcat should be instance methods
Why are the static addServlet() methods in Tomcat static?  I can see
they don't use any state from the instance, but isn't it cleaner to use
an instance method, so that the API is uniform (everything I want to do
to a tomcat instance goes through the instance)?  It would be more
consistent to follow the pattern of addServlet(String,String,String),
and search for the context by name instead of requiring the instance to
be passed in to a static method.
