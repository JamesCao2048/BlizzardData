57154 – Failure of TestWsWebSocketContainer when directory %TEMP%\test exists
Steps to reproduce:
1) Go to the temporary directory (System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")) and create a directory named "test" there.
2) Run org.apache.tomcat.websocket.TestWsWebSocketContainer test case with Nio or Nio 2.
The following two test cases are failing:
testWriteTimeoutServerEndpoint
testWriteTimeoutServerContainer
Cause of the failure is the following ERROR:
The HTTP response from the server [HTTP/1.1 302 Found
] did not permit the HTTP upgrade to WebSocket
javax.websocket.DeploymentException: The HTTP response from the server [HTTP/1.1 302 Found
] did not permit the HTTP upgrade to WebSocket
This test case configures DefaultServlet and tries to access
"ws://localhost:" + getPort() + "/test".
I suspect that Mapper responds with 302 redirect before the upgrade request reaches web application.
This issue is observed at Buildbot.
