37984 – JNDIRealm.java not able to handle MD5 password
I'm using JNDIRealm to authenticate to OpenLDAP 2.2.28.
 Within OpenLDAP I've
configured the userPassword attribute for each user to contain the MD5 digest,
and each is prefixed with the string "{MD5}".
 I am not an LDAP expert by any
means but I believe this prefix is a standard convention.
 Anyway assuming this
is a convention then JNDIRealm needs to strip off the "{MD5}" portion much like
it does with "{SHA1}".
 See attached patch which accomplishes this and I
verified it works in my environment.
