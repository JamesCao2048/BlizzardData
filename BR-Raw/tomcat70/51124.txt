51124 – ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException after setting org.apache.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl.LIMIT_BUFFER=true
First of all, I know that there has been a bug regarding a similar problem before and that it was fixed.
But currently this bugs occurs even with tomcat version 6.0.32.
We have a problem with the tomcat runnign with the parameter org.apache.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl.LIMIT_BUFFER=true.
After the tomcat has just started, everything is fine but after one or two days a lot of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occur on random pages of the application.
Tomcats started without this parameter don't seem to have that problem.
Unfortunately we weren't able reproduce the bug locally, It appears only on our production system.
Could there be a concurrency problem, that only shows if a lot it going on on the platform?
I can provide two small stackstraces that can show the classes where the problem occurs:
