58342 – org.apache.tomcat.websocket.WsSession has repeated conditional tests
Created attachment 33078 [details]
Patch file
In the method WsSession.removeMessageHandler(), two `if` statements have repeated conditional tests.
I did not investigate whether older versions of Tomcat have it however they're present in trunk.
I am attaching a patch to fix it.
I ran the tests and they passed with my changes.
