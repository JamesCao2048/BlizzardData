56273 – Manager webapp: when command is skipped because web application is being serviced, say about it
Looking at deploy/undeploy/upload methods in ManagerServlet, HtmlManagerServlet
The methods call "if (!isServiced(name))"  and if the web application is being serviced (e.g.
by another command running in parallel) the methods skip their work and report success.
Instead of that they should report that they skipped their work.
