54801 – EL-like expressions in jsp:scriptlet break compilation of JSP XML documents
Created attachment 30152 [details]
helloWorld.tagx
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Go to  webapps\examples\WEB-INF\tags\
2.
Delete "helloWorld.tag" file and put there "helloWorld.tagx" file attached to this issue.
The file contains the following plus AL header:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<jsp:root xmlns:jsp="http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page" version="2.0">
<jsp:scriptlet><![CDATA[//
// ${foo}
out.println("Hello, world!!");
]]></jsp:scriptlet>
</jsp:root>
3.
Start Tomcat and try to open the following page in a browser:
http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/jsp2/tagfiles/hello.jsp
ACTUAL result:
in current TC8 trunk:
org.xml.sax.SAXException: Body of scriptlet element must not contain any XML elements
org.apache.jasper.compiler.JspDocumentParser.checkScriptingBody(JspDocumentParser.java:1332)
org.apache.jasper.compiler.JspDocumentParser.endElement(JspDocumentParser.java:650)
This behaviour is caused by "${foo}" being present inside the scriptlet.
If I remove that line, the page is displayed successfully.
EXPECTED RESULT
I think EL expressions should not be recognized inside of jsp:scriptlet, jsp:declaration or jsp:expression and should not trigger such an error.
As a confirmation, the following "helloWorld.tag" in JSP syntax compiles and executes successfully.
Thus this issue is with XML syntax only,
<%
// ${foo}
%>
Hello, world!++
Alternative solution could be to change the error message, but I think it is not the issue here,
s/ any XML elements / any XML elements or EL expressions/
