53138 – Not able to download a file size of 740KB using NIO connector in tomcat version 7.0.27. But with the same configuration I was able to download that in tomcat 7.0.26.
We have an application that uses a java script file of size around 700Kb that will be downloaded as part of the client.
The connector used was NIO .
All these days we did not see any issue till Tomcat 7.0.26.
When we upgraded it to the latest Tomcat version 7.0.27 we started getting this problem.
The file is never getting downloaded the connection will be broken in middle.
And we used fiddler to see what is happening and it gives us a message as below
â€œContent-Length mismatch: Response Header indicated 757,692 bytes, but server sent 262,142 bytes.â€?
If I use the default connector there is no issues.
it works fine.
To reproduce this we have created a sample application.
Please follow the steps below.
Clean up all the browser cash:
1.	Deploy  TestNIOConnector app in tomcat.
2.	In server.xml change to connect to NIO as shown below.
<Connector port="9880" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" maxThreads="150" connectionTimeout="70000"
acceptCount="100" compression="on" acceptorThreadCount="2" redirectPort="8443" />
3.	Start the service and try to access this file using the following URL in IE.
http://localhost:9880/TestNIOConnector/apidocs.js
