47320 – Decoding jsessionid bug on z/os
If you receive a rewritten URL on z/os with uss (unix on a mainframe), Tomcat
does not properly decode the jsessionid portion of the URL.
The problem is in org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter in the parseSessionId method.
The two instantiations of a String object do not specify the encdoding to use.
e.g.
String sid = new String(uriBC.getBuffer(), start + sessionIdStart,
semicolon2 - sessionIdStart);
...as well as the second String instantiation in this method.
Consequently z/os uses its default encoding which (I think) is EBCDIC.
If I recompile with a hardcoded "UTF-8" for the encoding then the jsessionid decodes properly.
 Not that I am suggesting this literally for the official fix.
e.g.
String sid = new String(uriBC.getBuffer(), start + sessionIdStart,
semicolon2 - sessionIdStart, "UTF-8");
