54381 – Websocket StreamInbound never reports receipt of a Pong
The tomcat websocket api now allows the send of a Ping frame by the server (as of 7.0.33), via WsOutbound, but never reports the receipt of a Pong.
See StreamInbound in the onData() method...
} else if (opCode == Constants.OPCODE_PONG) {
// NO-OP
}
As the intended use of Pings is for heartbeat messages, allowing a Ping without informing the server extension of the returned Pong leaves out half the utility.
I would suggest these changes to StreamInbound as a fix...
1) In the onData() method...
} else if (opCode == Constants.OPCODE_PONG) {
onPong(frame.getPayLoad());
}
2) Add a method onPong (ByteBuffer buffer)...
protected void onPong(ByteBuffer buffer) {
// NO-OP
}
...which implementations may now override to handle Pong receipt and heartbeat logic.
This is necessary as onData() is marked final, so there's no alternate workaround.
