50771 – HttpServletRequest#getAuthType() returns null though the request is authenticated.
Created attachment 26648 [details]
I made a patch.
When Tomcat registers an authenticated Principal and authentication Type with current session,
only authenticated Principal is replicated, and authentication Type is not replicated.
Therefore, Request#getAuthType() returns null though the request is authenticated when the node changed.
Best Regards.
