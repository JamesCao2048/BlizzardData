39769 – Wrong class loader when the myServlet.destroy() called if myServlet is in the T5 shared directory
Hi all,
My web app needs to have Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() always
right.
 When the application is unload it seem not be the case.
My classes are under the T5's shared directory (so all my
servlet.getClass().getClassLoader() == the shared classloader i.e.:
StandardCalssLoader.
My understanding is that when executing the code in my web app
Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() should always give the
WebappLoader used in the StandardContext.
The problem occurs in StandardWrapper.unload()  before calling the
servlet.destroy() method
....
ClassLoader oldCtxClassLoader =
Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
ClassLoader classLoader = instance.getClass().getClassLoader();
PrintStream out = System.out;
if (swallowOutput) {
SystemLogHandler.startCapture();
}
// Call the servlet destroy() method
try {
instanceSupport.fireInstanceEvent
(InstanceEvent.BEFORE_DESTROY_EVENT, instance);
Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(classLoader);
if( System.getSecurityManager() != null) {
SecurityUtil.doAsPrivilege("destroy",
instance);
SecurityUtil.remove(instance);
} else {
instance.destroy();
}
....
In the code, the INSTANCE variable is my servlet and it have been loaded by the
SHARED classloader.
 So the classloader set in the thread is not the right one.
It Should be the classloader related to StandardContext.getLoader()
This problem occurs when I try to close my T5 dos windows and I suppose will
occurs when I will uninstall any webApp from my T5.
I notice the problem in T5 5.5.16 but I verified and it's the same code in
5.5.17.
 So probably the problem is still there
