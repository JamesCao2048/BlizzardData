51503 – Additional error checking required for connector port attribute (e.g. for port="")
With 7.0.18 packaged as a candidate for release and finally unreleased, when I stop the Tomcat service (only 1 war deployed), the service takes a lot of time to stop and finally was killed by system.
Having a look into the stderr log, I see it paused right after the folowing line :
INFO: Stopping ProtocolHandler [http-apr-0]
Then went into a slow loop and fill the log with these lines :
13 juil.
2011 14:30:30 org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint stopInternal
ATTENTION: Acceptor thread [http-apr-0-Acceptor-0] failed to unlock.
Forcing hard socket shutdown.
13 juil.
2011 14:30:31 org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint stopInternal
ATTENTION: Acceptor thread [http-apr-0-Acceptor-0] failed to unlock.
Forcing hard socket shutdown.
13 juil.
2011 14:30:32 org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint stopInternal
ATTENTION: Acceptor thread [http-apr-0-Acceptor-0] failed to unlock.
Forcing hard socket shutdown.
etc.
(about 30 times before it was killed)
I think there was no such issue with 7.0.16.
