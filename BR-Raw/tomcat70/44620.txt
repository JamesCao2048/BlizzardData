44620 – infinit loop in nio connector code
The code below has a chance to cause tomcat enter dead loop in class InternalNioOutputBuffer
private synchronized void addToBB(byte[] buf, int offset, int length) throws IOException {
-->       while (socket.getBufHandler().getWriteBuffer().remaining() < length) {
flushBuffer();
}
when the buffer size of socket is smaller than length.
The default size of socket comes from socket.appWriteBufSize, which is 8192; The value of length is limited by maxHttpHeaderSize, which is 9000.
Well, the chance for dead loop exists and happened.
It can be avoid if we config the two value correctly in server.xml
