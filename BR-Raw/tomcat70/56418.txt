56418 – Manager incorrectly reports deployment as OK even though it failed
Created attachment 31536 [details]
Proposed patch on tomcat7 trunk
When using the Manager to deploy a webapp remotely (uploading the war with an http PUT), the deployment status is incorrectly reported.
It does not occur when deploying a WAR that is on the server filesystem.
The proposed patch factors the check for the context state.
