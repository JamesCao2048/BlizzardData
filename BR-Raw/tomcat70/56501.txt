56501 – problems with urlencoding in webapp name
we have a webapp with a filter, that generates an index.html file if the app is called on its root directory or with index.html as path.
there is one edge case where this filter is ignored and tomcat trys to open an actual index.html (which does not exist).
this happens when the webapp contains a underscore (_) in its name and the app is opened with %5F encoding instead of the underscore and a leading /.
we found this issue while migrating our apps from tomcat 6 to tomcat 7(.0.52).
the manager app links the webapps with "/test%5Fapp/" (tomcat 6 used "/test%5Fapp" without the leading /) on tomcat 6 clicking the link the webapp opened as expected.
on tomcat 7 we get 404 or if we place a real index.html it is shown.
on tomcat 8 the real index.html is accessed too, haven't checked how the manager links to the app.
eg
WepApp name: test_app
http://tomcat/test_app - Filter
http://tomcat/test_app/ - Filter
http://tomcat/test%5Fapp - Filter
http://tomcat/test%5Fapp/ - index.html (404)
http://tomcat/test_app/index.html - Filter
http://tomcat/test%5Fapp/index.html - Filter
with name: testapp
http://tomcat/testapp - Filter
http://tomcat/testapp/ - Filter
http://tomcat/testapp/index.html - Filter
