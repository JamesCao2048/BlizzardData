53180 – DefaultInstanceManager#populateAnnotationsCache - incomplete check is used when validating for a setter method
Created attachment 28711 [details]
Patch proposal
Hi,
In org.apache.catalina.core.DefaultInstanceManager#populateAnnotationsCache, when iterating over methods in a given class, in one of the cases (when injection-target is specified) you validate whether the method is a valid setter method.
In my opinion the check that is used for that validation is not complete.
I would like to propose a patch (attached) that introduces additional checks in order to guarantee that the corresponding method is really suitable to be an injection target.
I'm looking forward to your commends.
Best Regards
Violeta Georgieva
