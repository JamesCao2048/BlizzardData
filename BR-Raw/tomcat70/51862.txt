51862 – JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener enhancement to load configurable classes
Enhancement proposed : add a "classesToInitialize" parameter to JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener to provoke the loading of arbitrary classes.
This will allow users to tune the memory leak protection features to avoid leaks triggered when loading JRE classes not yet identified as leaky, or even third-party classes.
I'll commit a patch in the next days...
