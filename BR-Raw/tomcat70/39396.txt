39396 – OPTIONS request on directory with no default file reports an incorrect list of allowed HTTP verbs
When an "options" http request is made to Tomcat to a directory that has no
default file (like index.jsp) in it, Tomcat reports a full list of allowed
verbs, when in fact, most of them are NOT allowed.
 For example, a request to
a generic img directory:
OPTIONS /img/ HTTP/1.0
Cookie: JSESSIONID=C46C2E18BE95AD91828C9370CBDF0AF2
Content-Length: 0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;
SV1; .NET CLR 1.1
4322; InfoPath.1)
Returns:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS
Content-Length: 0
Date: Mon, 24 Apr 2006 15:11:16 GMT
Connection: close
Which shows several destructive options available (PUT, DELETE).
 But a
request to DELETE or PUT (correctly) returns a 403 FORBIDDEN result:
DELETE /img/ HTTP/1.0
Cookie: JSESSIONID=C46C2E18BE95AD91828C9370CBDF0AF2
Content-Length: 0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;
SV1; .NET CLR 1.1
4322; InfoPath.1)
Returns:
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 964
Date: Mon, 24 Apr 2006 15:12:31 GMT
Connection: close
Because the initial OPTIONS request returns a list containing dangerous verbs,
the directory will be flagged as a serious security vulnerability by most
scanners (a false positive).
The issue DOES NOT occur when the directory HAS a default file in it:
OPTIONS /user_management/ HTTP/1.0
Cookie: JSESSIONID=C46C2E18BE95AD91828C9370CBDF0AF2
Content-Length: 0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;
SV1; .NET CLR 1.1
4322; InfoPath.1)
Returns:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
