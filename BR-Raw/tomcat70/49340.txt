49340 – Webapp unavailable after deploy then stop then start
Occurs with tomcat 7.0 RC3 but not with 6.0.26
Using the manager/html :
- deploy a war
- test one of its page, it should be deployed properly
- stop the webapp
- start the webapp
- test one of its page : FAILURE : tomcat returns a 404.
Notes :
- if using "reload" instead of stop/start it's OK, but it does not fix the unavailability
- if the webapp is present when tomcat is started, then the stop/start works normally
- The work around is to undeploy the webapp and redeploy it.
