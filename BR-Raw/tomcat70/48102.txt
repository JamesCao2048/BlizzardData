48102 – 'Bootstrap' is misspelled as 'Boostrap' in the javadoc of the class of 'org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap'
Below is the javadoc of the class of 'org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap':
/**
* Boostrap loader for Catalina.
 This application constructs a class loader
* for use in loading the Catalina internal classes (by accumulating all of the
* JAR files found in the "server" directory under "catalina.home"), and
* starts the regular execution of the container.
 The purpose of this
* roundabout approach is to keep the Catalina internal classes (and any
* other classes they depend on, such as an XML parser) out of the system
* class path and therefore not visible to application level classes.

the first word ommits a 't' letter.
It sould be 'Bootstrap', not 'Boostrap'.
