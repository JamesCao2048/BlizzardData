44562 – HEAD requests cannot go through request dispatch include.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-3896
briefly...
tomcat complains:
Servlet.service() for servlet SimpleDispatchServlet threw exception
javax.servlet.ServletException: Original SevletResponse or wrapped original ServletResponse not passed to
RequestDispatcher in violation of SRV.8.2 and SRV.14.2.5.1
at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher.checkSameObjects(ApplicationDispatcher.java:985)
...
The relevant code seems to be in javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
protected void doHead(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
throws ServletException, IOException
{
NoBodyResponse response = new NoBodyResponse(resp);
doGet(req, response);
response.setContentLength();
}
which is fine but
class NoBodyResponse implements HttpServletResponse {
rather than
class NoBodyResponse extends HttpServletResponseWrapper {
The patch attached to the jira issue makes this change and adapts NoBodyResponse to be a subclass of HttpServletResponseWrapper and the user reports that it fixes the problem.
  I don't know if there would be formatting issues applying the patch to tomcat's copy of the spec classes.
