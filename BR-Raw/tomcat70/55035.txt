55035 – Deploy ROOT webapp with version through text manager using Ant
Currently Ant "deploy" task does not support separate parameter "version" and, thanks to URLEncoder, there is no workaround for that.
But for apps with not empty context it's possible to define version using ##, like setting path to "/someContext#someVersion".
For apps with empty context we receive error:
Case #1:
<deploy url="{tomcat.manager}/text" username="${username}", password="${password}" path="/ROOT##12345" war="${pathtowar}" />
Result:
Failed to deploy application at context path /ROOT##12345
Case #1:
<deploy url="{tomcat.manager}/text" username="${username}", password="${password}" path="/##12345" war="${pathtowar}" />
Result:
Failed to deploy application at context path /##12345
