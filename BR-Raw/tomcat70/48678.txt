48678 – org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina incorrectly duplicates super class member
Catalina declares its own protected member variable "server" and a corresponding "setServer" method, while Catalina's super class Embedded has a private member "server" and a "getServer" method, so that Catalina sets its "service" member, but when asking, will return super.server which is consistently null.
This means that Catalina cannot be used as Tomcat embedding directly but at least requires an extension like so:
public class MyCatalina extends Catalina {
public Server getServer() {
return this.server;
}
}
It might have other ramifications though and was most likely not intended.
