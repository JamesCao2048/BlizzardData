54984 – multipart/form-data is not always read with correct encoding
The bug occurs when form data is posted as multipart/form-data and using Servlet 3 API to get posted files.
In a servlet, if we set the encoding:
request.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
Then invoke:
request.getParts()
And then invoke:
String text = request.getParameter("sometextfield");
UTF-8 characters in the text have been garbled.
Order of method calls are significant, if a getParameter is called before getParts, the correct encoding will be used.
However, the order which you invoke the methods should not matter.
