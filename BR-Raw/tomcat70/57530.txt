57530 – Reimplement TestAbstractHttp11Processor.testNon2xxResponseWithExpectation test using SimpleHttpClient instead of Java 6
As was noted when testing 7.0.59 release candidate, the testNon2xxResponseWithExpectation test in org.apache.coyote.http11.TestAbstractHttp11Processor fails when running with Java 6,
[[[

The test sets up a web application with a security constraint that
forbids access to an echo servlet.
It sends a request with "Expect:
100-continue"  and expects a 403 response with "Connection: close"
header.
Running with a debugger, Java 6u45 does not send the "Expect:
100-continue" header, as the test expects.
I have not found a java bug report for this specific issue, but from those that I found I think that
- handling of "Expect: 100-continue" is a late addition (since Java 7 only?) and
- it is more complicated than necessary for this simple test (HttpURLConnection handles the full request-response cycle, including 100 (Continue) response, timeouts etc).
I think that this case can be reimplemented using a more simple client implementation,
org.apache.catalina.startup.SimpleHttpClient
I also expect that Tomcat rejects the request immediately without sending a 100 (Continue) response.
This detail can be tested by reimplementing the test with SimpleHttpClient.
