57324 – Change in Expect100Continue behaviour in Tomcat is breaking existing clients with "keepalive" connections
1) In the version of Tomcat 7.0.50, the behavior of Coyote handler is modified to handle "Expect: 100-continue" clients.
To be specific look at this change in the following line, http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-coyote/7.0.50/org/apache/coyote/http11/AbstractHttp11Processor.java#1088
2) In the above change, the fix was done to handle cases against misbehaving client while POST requests are submitted to Tomcat.
3) While it is done with a "security" intent, the fix only takes into account status codes ranging in 2xx series.
It breaks some legitimate cases where other status codes are returned for legitimate usecases.
An example is given below.
Example:
* It is quite normal to have a keepalive connections with different resources having different authorization controls
* HTTP 401 is typical of webservers to inform clients of unauthorized access to resources and triggering client to resubmit the request.
Please refer http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html for 401 behavior.
* The change done in Tomcat breaks this legitimate case.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Install a version of Tomcat 7.0.50 or above
2) Write a client that uses Expect100Continue behavior along with KeepAlive
3) Make atleast two requests with the first request succeeding and second request simulating a HTTP 401 scenario.
4) Notice that the server closes the connection after the second response
5) This will break clients which are in the process of responding to the second request with valid credentials
Why blocker:
1) .NET defaults to Expect 100 behaviour
2) .NET clients optimize the keepalive connections and do not send credentials with every request going out on keepalive connections
3) This induces 401 situation more often in communications between Tomcat and .NET clients
4) Closing of server connections is causing existing connections to break and our customers are complaining this started happening after upgrading Tomcat (7.0.50)
5) Hence, this needs attention.
