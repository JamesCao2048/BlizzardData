57837 – add "text/css" to default of compressableMimeType
as per https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html
I put compression="10" into the server.xml, but https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed claims gzip is not yet activated.
I have also tried
compression="on" compressionMinSize="512"
with the same result.
