54068 – Web fragment sorting incorrectly detects circular reference
Created attachment 29522 [details]
Test case implementation
The implementation of web fragment sorting with relative ordering constraints may detect circular references, even though there is no such circle.
This occurrence of this bug depends on the iteration order of the input map.
Consider the attached test case, defining a simple chain of three web fragments:
* web fragments a, b, c, with relative constraints "b after a", "c after b".
* expected result: a, b, c
* actual result:
Testcase: testOrderWebFragmentsRelative4 took 0,002 sec
Caused an ERROR
Fragment relative ordering contains circular references.
Thsi can be resolved by using absolute ordering in web.xml.
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Fragment relative ordering contains circular references.
Thsi can be resolved by using absolute ordering in web.xml.

Workaround: use absolute ordering.
