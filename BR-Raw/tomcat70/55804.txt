55804 – SPNEGOAUTHENTICATOR - GSSCredential does not get renewed after RemainingLifeTime is less than zero
In SpnegoAuthenticator, we check for request.getUserPrincipal() if it returns a prinicpal we do not do a fresh authentication.
This happens even when the GSSCredential returned by GenericPrincipal has remainingLife time less than zero.
This causes issues in delegating the credential as the credential is not valid any more.
Can we add additional check to reauthenticate when the credental has expired and put GSSCredential in the same session?
