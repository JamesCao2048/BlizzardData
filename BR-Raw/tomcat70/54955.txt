54955 – Mapping to application context root returns 404 after reload
Created attachment 30273 [details]
A minimum war file to reproduce the bug with sources attached
URL mapping specified as ""(empty string) maps a servlet to the context root according to servlet specification.
This feature is working when an application is deployed, but broken when it's reloaded.
A reload will result in 404 error.
(Other url mappings are OK, only "")
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a servlet with URL mapping as empty string, you can either use @WebServlet("") annotation or <url-pattern></url-pattern> in web.xml
2) If you deploy it in Tomcat 7.0.40, it will work.
(e.g.
http://localhost:8080/myapp/)
3) But if you reload the app (say using the manager app), http://localhost:8080/myapp/ will give 404 error.
Servlet in step 1 is never called this time.
Actual Results: 404 Not Found
Expected Results: Show the context root page.
Env: Tomcat 7.0.40, Java 7, Windows 8
