46985 – Impossible condition in coyote.http11.Http11Processor.process(Socket socket)
coyote.http11.Http11Processor.process(Socket socket)
...
int soTimeout = socket.getSoTimeout();
int oldSoTimeout = soTimeout;
int threadRatio = (endpoint.getCurrentThreadsBusy() * 100)
/ endpoint.getMaxThreads();
if (threadRatio > 75) {
keepAliveLeft = 1;
}
if (soTimeout != oldSoTimeout) {
The above condition will never be true.
It looks like the code is trying to reset the timeout if it has not changed, but it will never do so.
Both the method and the class have a variable called "socket" which may be part of the problem - is the method trying to set the instance socket to have the same timeout as the parameter socket, or vice versa?
The socket parameter should be renamed.
Note that the Javadoc appears to be completely wrong as well.
