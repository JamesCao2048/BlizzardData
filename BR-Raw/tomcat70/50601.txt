50601 – Redundant null checks before instanceof in equals()
Created attachment 26497 [details]
Patch to remove null checks
There are several instances of the following code in equals methods:
if (obj == null) return false;
if (!(obj instanceof SomeClass)) return false;
The null check is redundant, as null will fail the instanceof check.
