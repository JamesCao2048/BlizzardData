49785 – Enable STARTTLS for JNDIRealm
Created attachment 25916 [details]
InitialContextFactory which produces TLS enabled LdapContext instances
To enable TLS for LDAP inside JNDIRealm one has to either patch JNDIRealm directly and introduce another state variable to hold TLS-state - and thus make introduction of pooling harder, or use a factory which produces TLS enabled DirContext instances.
Such a factory is attached.
It can be configured by specifying a contextFactory in JNDIRealm config:
&lt;Realm
...
contextFactory="org.apache.catalina.realm.LdapTlsContextFactory"
...
/&gt;
I think it would be a good idea to add a parameter startTLS to JNDIRealm, which would automatically use the above TLS-ContextFactory.
If wanted, I could supply a patch.
(the patch is against tomcat 6.0.x trunk, but I think it will apply fine to trunk too)
