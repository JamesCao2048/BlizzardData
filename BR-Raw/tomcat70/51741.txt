51741 – Eclipse WTP "Serve modules without publishing" broken with tc7, needs patch in tomcat
Eclipse WTP has an option "Serve modules without publishing" that works well with tc6, but not with tc7.
After investigation by the WTP team, there seem to be no way for them to fix this without modifying tomcat.
The problem in WTP is reported here : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=333102
Basically, their DirContext implementation (org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.loader.WtpDirContext) returns a ResourceAttributes that correctly points to an existing location, but org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.findResourceInternal(String, String) ignores it and returns a ResourceEntry whose codeBase and source fields point to a non-existing location.
This breaks applications that call getResource(...) on the Thread ContextClassLoader and use the returned URL.
A call to getResourceAsStream(...) on the Thread CCL is OK.
