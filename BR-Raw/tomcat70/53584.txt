53584 – Forms authentication without cookies requires double submission in 6.0.33
Created attachment 29093 [details]
Standalone test app which reproduces the issue
We have an application which uses the forms authentication provided by Servlet specification and is configured store session IDs in the URL rather than using cookies.
This configuration has been working as expected under Tomcat 6.0.32 and earlier.
On upgrading to Tomcat 6.0.33 or 6.0.35 this combination no longer works as expected.
Specifically, when a user initially submits the login form they are immediately returned back to the form-login-page.
Submitting the login form a second time allows them to log in.
The only difference I have been able to spot between the first and second form submission is for the second submission the request attribute "javax.servlet.forward.request_uri" now has the jsessionid appended to the URL.
Attached is a standalone WAR which reliably reproduces the problem with 6.0.33 and 6.0.35.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Unpack tomcat 6.0.33.
I used windows version "apache-tomcat-6.0.33-windows-x86.zip".
2) Drop forms-auth-test.war into the webapps directory.
3) Disable cookies by editing conf/context.xml:
<Context cookies="false">
....
</Context>
4) Add a user to authenticated with to conf/tomcat-users.xml:
<tomcat-users>
<role rolename="tomcat"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat"/>
</tomcat-users>
5) Launch tomcat, I used "bin/catalina.bat start".
6) Navigate to http://localhost:8080/forms-auth-test/index.jsp
7) Enter user:tomcat pass:tomcat (should be prefilled).
Click login.
8) Observe that you are returned to the login page (with a session ID in the URL this time).
9) Enter the username and password again and click login.
10) Login should succeed this time.
