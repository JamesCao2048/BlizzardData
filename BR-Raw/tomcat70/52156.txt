52156 – ServletContext.getResource(path) doesn't accept ".." anymore
With WAR-packaged webapp,
getServletContext().getResource("/mydata/../mydata/myfile.txt")
should return the same URL as
getServletContext().getResource("/mydata/myfile.txt")
but returns NULL instead.
It's ok for folder-based webapp.
It was working in Tomcat 6.0.20.
It looks like Bug 10629 (WARDirContext.java regression?).
