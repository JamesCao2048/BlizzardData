52091 – TagHandlerPool is slow when high concurrently
TagHandlerPool is slow when I ran stress test my web application using tomcat7.
It occured in 7.0.19.
Profiler said that it causes are followings:
1.
Lock of log instance at org.apache.jasper.runtime.TagHandlerPool.
2.
Lock of parameters field at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapper.getInitParameter.
An attached patch resolve this issue in my environment.
It makes following changes:
1.
Makes log field to static.
2.
At StandardWrapper, changes lock policy from synchronized block to ReentrantReadWriteLock.
