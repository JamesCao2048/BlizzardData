48387 – Make RemoteIpFilter parameters consistent with RemoteIpValve
Created attachment 24705 [details]
Rename RemoteIpFilter#protocolHeaderSslValue into protocolHeaderHttpsValue
RemoteIpFilter field 'protocolHeaderSslValue' is not consistent with RemoteIpValve where it is named 'protocolHeaderHttpsValue'.
Proposed patch renames 'protocolHeaderSslValue' into 'protocolHeaderHttpsValue' (field + getter and setter) and enhance one javadoc sentence.
