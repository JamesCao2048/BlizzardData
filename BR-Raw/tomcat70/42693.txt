42693 – JSP-Generation error with recursive tagfile structure
addendum: it's Version 6.13 (not available in combobox above)
scenario:
=========
a menu is decribed by a tree structure;
rendering the menu is done by a tagfile 'render_menuitem', which renders the
current item either as a leaf item (clicking on it causes an action) or as a
node item (clicking on it opens another next-level submenu);
rendering the submenu is done by calling the tagfile again from within its body;
this worked fine with tomcat 5.0.x and 5.5.x
to make it clear see the following pseudo code (the original code is to
voluminous):
tagfile 'render_menuitem.tagx':
<jsp:root ...>
<jsp:directive.attribute name="menu_item"/>
<c:choose>
<c:when test="${menu_item.isNode}
<div>node: ${menu_item.label}</div>
<c:forEach var="sub_item" items="menu_item.children">
<!-- THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH TOMCAT6: -->
<tags:render_menuitem menu_item="${sub_item}"/>
</c:forEach>
<c:when>
<c:otherwise>
<div>leaf: ${menu_item.label}</div>
</c:otherwise>
</c:choose>
</jsp:root>
faulty behaviour:
================
with tomcat 6.0.13, the generated Java-Source for the tagfile reveals, that the
body of the doTag() method is empty and therefore emits no html; the compilation
itself was silently done, no error or warning was shown in the logfiles.
