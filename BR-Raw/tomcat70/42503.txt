42503 – ServletContext.getResourceAsStream returns stale data
Under certain conditions, the resource cache implementation used by the
servlet/JSP engine (in org.apache.naming.resource) does not detect that a file
in its cache has been modified and therefore returns the previous contents of
the file.
This happens only
* when the file contents are modified but the file length doesn't change
* until the time the first change in the file is detected after server startup
To reproduce the problem, put the attached test.jsp and test.txt into the ROOT
web app and then do the following.
(I used Tomcat 6's trunk for the test)
% cat test.txt
abcd
% telnet .
