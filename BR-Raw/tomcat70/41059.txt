41059 – WebAppClassLoader clearReferences code break running threads
When the WebAppClassLoader stops it manually sets all static and final
variables to null in the clearReferences method.
 This results in NPEs for any
thread that was not stopped and not expecting its final or static variables to
be null.
 This is particularly a problem with hot deploys since the unload
fails and terminating the deploy.
