testcase demonstrating the bug
when starting a new thread from a startAsync Runnable, an infinite amount of doPosts is generated.
Also, the GET status is: 500 Internal Server Error,
however, there is no exception thrown by tomcat.
The attached code demonstrates this, by printing "Start async()" an infinite amount of times.
