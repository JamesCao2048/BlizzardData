47343 – Fails re-deploying, when we update context.xml.
When context.xml of the conf/<engine>/<host>directory is updated, docBase directory is deleted and fails re-deploying.
Reproduction.
(The context name is assumed to be testWebapp.
)
1.<<Tomcat_home>>/webapps/testWebapp/META-INF/context.xml is prepared.
2.Context.xml is not put under the conf/<engine>/<host> directory.
(means first deployed)
3.Tomcat is started.
(testWebapp.xml is created to the conf/<engine>/<host> directory.
)
4.testWebapp.xml of conf/<engine>/<host > is updated.
Result.
<<Tomcat_home>>/webapps/testWebapp directory is deleted.
The cause is in the fixed of "http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=712464".
The order of the resource added to HostConfig$DeployedApplication#redeployResources was changed by this fix.
order of the redploy resources is as follows.
[before fix]
Case of Deploy war.
war -> context.xml(conf/<engine>/<host>) -> doceBase directory
Case of Deploy directory.
doceBase directory -> context.xml(META-INF/context.xml)
[after fix]
Case of Deploy war.
context.xml(conf/<engine>/<host>) -> war -> doceBase directory
Case of Deploy directory.
context.xml(META-INF/context.xml) -> doceBase directory
HostConfig#checkResources is as follows.
for (int i = 0; i < resources.length; i++) {
...omits
if ((!resource.isDirectory()) && resource.lastModified() > lastModified) {
...omits
// Delete other redeploy resources
for (int j = i + 1; j < resources.length; j++) {
try {
File current = new File(resources[j]);
...omits
ExpandWar.delete(current);
}
} catch (IOException e) {
log.warn(sm.getString
("hostConfig.canonicalizing", app.name), e);
}
}
...omits
After all,
When testWebapp.xml of conf/<engine>/<host > is updated,
directory is deleted or war and the directory are deleted.
As a result,
It fails in deploying because it tries to deploy it only with context.xml (docBase direcotry doesn't exist).
Regards.
