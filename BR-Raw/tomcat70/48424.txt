48424 – Keep same logic for creating the objectnames for connector mbeans
Currently, for connector MBeans, they are registered and unregistered by Connector classes themselves.
But in the ServerLifecycle and MBeanUtils, there are also codes for unregistering the connector MBeans.
Suppose it is used for double check ?
The question is that the codes for creating connector object name are not same, in the MBeanUtils, it always assume that address property is of String type, sometimes that a ClassCastException would be thrown.
