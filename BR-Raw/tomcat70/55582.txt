55582 – Concurrent issue of TagFileProcessor
Created attachment 30871 [details]
Unsynchronized getting wrapper from RuntimeContext
The following code has concurrent issue.
JspRuntimeContext rctxt = ctxt.getRuntimeContext();
JspServletWrapper wrapper = rctxt.getWrapper(wrapperUri);
synchronized (rctxt) {
if (wrapper == null) {
....
It creates duplicated JspServletWrapper in this scenario,
A.jsp --> C.tag
B.jsp --> C.tag
A.jsp and B.jsp are both compiling and come to the given lines.
Two threads all get null from JspRuntimeContext(JspServletWrapper == null).
So two instances of JspServletWrapper was created.
