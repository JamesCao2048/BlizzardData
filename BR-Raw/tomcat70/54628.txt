there is something wrong when send binary data by websocket.
see org.apache.catalina.websocket.WsOutbound.doWriteBytes(ByteBuffer, boolean)
I think
// Write the content
upgradeOutbound.write(buffer.array(), 0, buffer.limit());
upgradeOutbound.flush();
should change to :
// Write the content
upgradeOutbound.write(buffer.array(), buffer.arrayOffset(), buffer.limit());
upgradeOutbound.flush();
For example:
byte[] bts = new byte[]{1,2,3,4,5}
ByteBuffer bf = ByteBuffer.wrap(bts, 2, 2);
out.writeBinaryMessage(bf);
I mean write [3,4] to the client, but in fact [1,2,3,4] be sent;
