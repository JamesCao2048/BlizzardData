58489 – QueryStatsComparator throws IllegalArgumentException: Comparison method violates its general contract!
Created attachment 33177 [details]
JUnit test to show the exception
Overview:
QueryStatsComparator may throw java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Comparison method violates its general contract!
This happens in specific situations depending on the data in the reported queries.
In our environment this occurs every time we keep the server running until the maxCapacity (1000 items) is reached and the removeOldest method is called.
I have managed to narrow down the test data from more than 1000 records to around 40 items and created a JUnit test to showcase the error.
I needed to copy some parts out of the SlowQueryReport class and made some simplifications as the QueryStatsComparator is not reachable from outside.
Steps to Reproduce:
Please use the attached JUnit source code to reproduce this error.
Additional Builds and Platforms:
This bug seems to happen on all platforms.
We are using Tomcat 8, tomcat-dbcp 8.0.24, JDK 1.80.0_60.
Additional Information:
It seems to be a problem of the first two lines of the QueryStatsComparator.
Note that a single change in the data of the unit test may cause the Exception not to occur.
Stacktrace:
