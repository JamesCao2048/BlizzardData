34399 – Undeploying fails when context defined in server.xml & server fails to stop
Steps to reproduce:
1.
autodeploy a web application by defining its context in server.xml
2.
start the Tomcat server
3.
use the Tomcat Manager to undeploy the application
You will get the "OK - Undeployed application at context path /WebApplication"
message, but the application will NOT be undeployed, it will be only stopped.
If you try to stop the server after that, it will fail!
I have used the shared installation (CATALINA_BASE dir), but I guess this
won't work for standalone Tomcat isntallation either.
