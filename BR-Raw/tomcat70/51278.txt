51278 – Unable to override default servlet other than in main web.xml
The default web.xml gets merged into the application's web.xml before processing of fragments, annotations and ServletContextInitializers.
This means it can only be overridden in the application's web.xml.
It should be possible to override in fragments, annotations and ServletContextInitializers.
