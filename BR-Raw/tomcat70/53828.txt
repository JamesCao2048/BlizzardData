53828 – StreamInbound.closeOutboundConnection(WsFrame) closes with an opcode instead of status
201	private void closeOutboundConnection(WsFrame frame) throws IOException {
202	  try {
203	    getWsOutbound().close(frame);
204	  } finally {
205	    doOnClose(Constants.OPCODE_CLOSE);
206	  }
207	}
Line 205 uses the close opcode instead of a valid status (Constants.STATUS_*).
Not sure of the exact context of this called but it seems to only be called when the last frame from the client was a close frame, thus a Constants.STATUS_NORMAL may be in order.
If not, the frame's opcode could be inspected and mapped to an appropriate status (normal, shutdown, etc...).
Thanks,
