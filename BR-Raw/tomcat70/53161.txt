53161 – Need better error message for annotation scanning errors
See this question on SO:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10373077/tomcat-7-severe-a-child-container-failed-during-start
There is a problem scanning a class but no info on which one.
It could be fault input of BCEL could need updating for a newer Java version.
If the error message identified the class triggering the problem, it could be analysed.
A better error message is required that names the class having the problem.
