55158 – Wasted work in AttributeNamesEnumerator constructor
Created attachment 30498 [details]
patch
The problem appears in version 7.0.41 and in revision 1497999.
 I
attached a two-line patch  that fixes it.
In the "AttributeNamesEnumerator" constructor, the loop over
"specials" keeps overriding "last" with "i".
 Therefore, only the last
written value is visible out of the loop and all the other writes and
iterations are not necessary.
 The patch iterates from the end of
"specials" and breaks the first time when "last" is set.
