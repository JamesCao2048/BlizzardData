52726 – An incomplete fix for the resource leak bug in MemoryUserDatabase.java
The fix revision 423920 was aimed to remove an resource leak bug on the  FileInputStream object "fis" (created line 418) in the method "open()" of the file "/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/users/MemoryUserDatabase.java" , but it is incomplete.
There are some problems:
1.
when the statements at lines 420-439 throw some exception, the "fis" can not be closed as expected.
The best way to close such resource objects is putting such close operations in the finaly block of a try-catch-finally structure.
