54379 – Implement support for post-construct and pre-destroy elements in web.xml
There appears to be a feature that web[-fragment].xml file can contain such elements as <post-construct> and <pre-destroy>, and they are treated as equivalents to @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations being present on the classes mentioned in them.
This feature is
1.
mentioned in the Java EE 6 Platform Specification, chapter "EE.5.2.5 Annotations and Injection" [1]
2.
mentioned in chapter "8.2.3 Assembling the descriptor from web.xml, webfragment.xml and annotations",
see points "k." and "l." on page 81 (103/230) of servlet-3_0-mrel-spec.pdf

An example can be found in Jetty wiki:

Searching by the tag names, I do not see any code in the current trunk that processes those XML elements.
