55956 – Regarding Tomcat Manager Application Status
In Tomcat Manager Application, when we browse status page report for currently running request, there is column name which shows Client IP address.
If my tomcat is running Behind Proxy or Behind NGINX or Behind Apache Mod Proxy, then Client IP is IP address of Last Proxy.
I have tried to pass X-Forwarded-For parameter but there is no change in Client IP address.
Same problem exist in request.getRemoteAddr() (always returns proxy IP address) and Access Log Configuration (logs proxy IP address in access log file).
It would be nice if we can incorporate X-Forwarded-For (or like wise HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR,Proxy-Client-IP etc) in above situations.
