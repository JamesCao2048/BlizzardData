49129 – DigestAuthenticator.md5Helper - possible incorrect lazy initialisation
Findbugs says:
"This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field.
Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions, threads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object, if the method can be called by multiple threads.
You can make the field volatile to correct the problem."
