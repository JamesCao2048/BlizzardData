51294 – Since 7.0.12 do not work option unpackWARs=true for WARs outside appBase
In 7.0.12 was added in Changelog this line:
--
Don't unpack WAR files if they are not located in the Host's appBase.
(markt)
--
It's change method of deployment from older versions of Tomcat (5.5, 6.0, 7.0.11) and forced to change logics on early configured servers.
May be need to add new parameter like 'unpackExternalWARs=true' to be able to configure this? (Why outside WARs is worse than inside?)
