54141 – Configuration does not allow Realms to be nested more than 2 levels deep
The use case is to have one Realm that is configured for lock-out with another that is not: the two should be combined together.
The obvious configuration attempt is this:
<CombinedRealm>
<LockoutRealm>
<DataSourceRealm/>
</LockoutRealm>
<UserDatabaseRealm/>
</CombinedRealm>
Unfortunately, this configuration yields an error:
No rules found matching 'Server/Service/Engine/Realm/Realm/Realm'
org.apache.catalina.startup.RealmRuleSet.addRuleInstances only goes 2 levels deep when it comes to Realms (that is, only allows "Realm" and "Realm/Realm").
Adding a 3rd level would certainly work here and might be sufficient.
Another option would be to configure the digester to allow arbitrary levels of Realm-nesting for even the most pathological cases.
