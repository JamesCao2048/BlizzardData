57308 – Replace System.getProperty("file.separator") with File.separator throughout
Most of Tomcat uses File.separator, but there are a few instances of System.getProperty("file.separator")
The two can be different, but still allow the JVM to start up.
I found the following worked:
java -Dfile.separator=/xyz
for Unix or the equivalent \xyz on Windows.
Using a different first character does not work - the JVM usually throws an exception as it cannot find some required files if the sep.
is incorrect.
It looks like only the first character of the property is used by the JVM.
However, this is not done by the application code I have seen, which means that there could be a discrepancy between the two methods.
File.separator has the additional benefit that it is not subject to a privilege check.
