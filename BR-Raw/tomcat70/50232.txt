50232 – org.apache.catalina.session.StoreBase has a hidden dependency on PersistentManager
Created attachment 26270 [details]
Removes hidden dependency on PersistentStore
StoreBase.java depends explicitly on the Manager interface, however, it later casts the manager object to the PersistentManager class with out any check.
This removes that dependency, therefore allowing the usage of this store with any manager that does not extend PersistentManager.
I will later attach a path that removes the offending isLoaded() method as that may induce the same problem further along...
