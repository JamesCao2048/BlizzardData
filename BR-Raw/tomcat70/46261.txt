Context with %2F in name causes tomcat crash on shutdown
Several years ago I worked on integrating tomcat 5.5 into our web application management infrastructure.
 During the process I fixed several tomcat 5.5 bugs, but apparently never sent the fixes upstream.
 Oops.
Our application needs to be deployed to create a URL that looks like this:
/product/customername/servlet
I worked with several people on IRC to get tomcat5.5 to do this.
 We had previously been using the path= parameter in the context xml file element with tomcat 4.1.
 Unfortunately, it appears this feature was removed from tomcat5.5, and tomcat5.5 does not recurse into subdirectories when reading .xml context files.
 The recommendation on IRC (after several suggestions which would not work for our environment) was to put %2F in the context xml file's name.
 Such as this
product%2Fcustomername.xml
This does work, however when you try to shutdown tomcat 6.0.18, you will get this crash:
