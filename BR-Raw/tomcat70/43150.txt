43150 – Tomcat and path with pound sign (#) -> ClassNotFoundException
Tomcat will not start if it's located and launched from a path with a # (pound)
character somewhere.
You'll find all informations in the given mail-thread on
tomcat-user, including some developer specific informations.
One part of the problem is the usage of File.toURL in URLClassloader...
I'd really appreciate it if this problem could be fixed/worked around (see
mail-thread for hints).
btw.
the same applies to version 5.5 and probably earlier versions too.
thanks!
