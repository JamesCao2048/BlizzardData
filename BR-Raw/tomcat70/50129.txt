50129 – ContextConfig - unnecessary null checks
Created attachment 26192 [details]
Patch to remove null checks
Sample code:
urlPatterns = processAnnotationsStringArray(evp.getValue());
urlPatternsSet = urlPatterns != null && urlPatterns.length > 0;
for (String urlPattern : urlPatterns) {
The check "urlPatterns != null" is unnecessary as the method call never returns null.
If it could return null, then the for loop would cause an NPE.
