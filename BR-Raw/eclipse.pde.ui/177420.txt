Bug 177420 – EquinoxLaunchConfiguration does not consider bundle version when launching
Build ID: I20070209-1006
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Set the PDE target environment to one that contains 2 bundles with the same ID but different versions
2.
Select either of the bundles to be launched
3.
Launch the configuration
4.
Observe that the generated config.ini does not change depending on which bundle is chosen (the same .jar file is referenced
5.
Reopen the launch configuration.
 Both bundles are selected.
More information:
It looks like EquinoxLaunchConfiguration doesn't take into account bundle versions when generating program arguments.
 The getBundles(boolean) method iterates over 'fAllBundles', obtaining an IPluginModelBase for each plugin.
 It then uses only the ID when calling LaunchConfigurationHelper.getBundleURL to generate the bundle URL, losing the version information.
I'm not sure if this is the only place where version info is lost.
