Bug 329218 – Provide a consumer based report launch config UI
Extension to bug 322571.
 The consumer oriented report should be available from the existing launch configuration.
 We should have a radio button or combo to select the type of report.
 Most of the controls will be the same between the settings.
We could also add an option to produce both reports.
