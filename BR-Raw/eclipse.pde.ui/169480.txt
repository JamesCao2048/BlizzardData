Bug 169480 – MANIFEST.MF editor does not display plug-in names with commas
I don't know if commas are supposed to be allowed in a plug-in's name (not the id), but they are not being properly displayed in the 'Overview' tab of the multi-page editor if you do use them.
If you put in 'a,b' and save, the text field is set to just 'a'.
If you click on the 'MANIFEST.MF' tab, you do see 'a,b' as the name though.
The same applies for 'a,b,c', resetting to 'a'.
If you use 'a,,b', the text field is cleared to '', the empty string, so I guess some kind of comma parser is involved here.
Either way, I guess the parser needs to be updated to flag an error for using commas or changed to return the correct name with the comma(s).
