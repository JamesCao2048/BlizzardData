Bug 314595 – Prevent PluginModelManager from being instantiated
Bug 313922 was caused by additional PluginModelManagers being instantiated whenever a feature launch occurred.
 Each time a manager is instantiated it registers listeners that affect the java build path.
To prevent bugs like this in the future we should prevent PluginModelManager from being instantiated.
 We can add a javadoc comment, make the constructor package visible (PDECore being the only place that should instantiate), and/or make the class a singleton (with getInstance() instead of a public constructor).
