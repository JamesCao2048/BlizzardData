Bug 269685 – Importing plug-ins as source should not import .class files
I20090317-1745
Importing plug-ins as source should not import .class files.
Currently, all class files from the binary plug-in end up in the root of the imported plug-in (in their folders, so you usually just see an 'org' or 'com' folder inside the project).
