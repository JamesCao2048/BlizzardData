Bug 435321 – Char range is off by one marking constructor method reference
Created attachment 243309 [details]
screen shot
consider the following snippet:
public class MethodRefConstructorTest {
class MR {
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public <T> void mr(Supplier<T> supplier) {}
};
void m1() {
MR mr = new MR();
mr.mr(MySupplier<String>::new);
}
}
where MySupplier is restricted and comes from a required bundle.
The section marked for the error is '(MySupplier<String>::new'.
I would not expect the leading '(' to be marked.
See the attached screen shot.
