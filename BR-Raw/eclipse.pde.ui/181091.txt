Bug 181091 – [Plug-in Dependencies View} Show version number in label
It is odd that we don't show a bundle version in this view.
 We show it everywhere else in PDE.
This is particularly important when we are dealing with multiple versions of the same plug-in.
 It is good to see what you are getting wired to.
P.S.
 The new implementation of the view is awesome.
