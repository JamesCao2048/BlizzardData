Bug 210131 – Extension Registry enhancement - include disabled plug-ins
This bug is to track the updates to the extension registry.
 The original implementation discarded disabled plug-ins.
 This caused problems such as bug 202410.
 Also, this leads to inaccurate results when doing a plug-in search for extensions when you select "All plug-ins".
 Another area this changed was producing errors on extension references to plug-ins that were disabled.
When the extension registry is updated to handle disabled plug-ins, this should fix all these problems.
