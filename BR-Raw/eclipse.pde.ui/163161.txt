Bug 163161 – PDE Extension Wizard creates bad plugin.xml file
When you use the PDE Add Extension (at least for hello, world action) the plugin.xml file is messed up.
steps to reproduce:
1) create a new plugin project (call it test)
2) open the Manifest edtor
3) open the extension tab
4) add a new extension (select action set -> hello, world)
5) save the file
look the plugin.xml file.
 Some of the xml is outside the <plugin> </plugin> tags.
