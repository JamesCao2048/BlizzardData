Bug 221019 – Duplicated entries in classpath container
When a bundle is added as a Require-Bundle to the Manifest and is included in the dependency management section, the jar is added to the classpath twice.
 This causes errors in JDT.
 PDE should update its logic to not include a jar if it is already included in the classpath container.
