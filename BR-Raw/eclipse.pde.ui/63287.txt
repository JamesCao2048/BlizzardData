Bug 63287 – Flickering in the â€œImport plug-insâ€? dialog on the Mac
I am using Build id: 200405201226.
This only happens on the Mac (and Linux I believe).
Steps:
- Go to "File->Import"
- Select "External Plug-ins and Fragments" and press "Next"
- Uncheck the "Target platform" box
- Type random characters in the "Plug-in Location" field
- Notice the flickering of the dialog's error message
I have traced this back to "PluginImportWizardFirstPage#validateDropLocation()".
I put print statements in "WizardPage#setErrorMessage(String newMessage)".
It
turns out that the "validateDropLocatoin()" method is calling the
"setErrorMessage()" twice on every keystroke.
By looking at the code, I noticed you call a "setErrorMessage(null)" at the
beginning, then the error message is set again later in the code.
I commented
out the "setErrorMessage(null)" call at the beginning of the method and the
flickering went away.
I am unaware of the reasons behind having the "setErrorMessage(null)â€? at the
beginning of the method even though the message is set again in that same
method, so I am logging this to your team.
