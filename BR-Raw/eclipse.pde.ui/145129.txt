Bug 145129 – [Product Editor] Add progress and message bar feature in Splash page is incomplete
"Note that by default, no progress will be reported at startup.
To enable startup progress reporting, set the following preference to true, for example in the preference customization file: IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants.SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP"
This was added to org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/product_configproduct.htm, and should probably be repeated in org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/guide/tools/editors/product_editor/branding.htm
