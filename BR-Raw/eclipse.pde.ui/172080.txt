Bug 172080 – Quick fix broken: Externalize manifest header value
Eclipse version > Build id: I20070123-1715
Steps To Reproduce:
(1) Open PDE compiler preferences
Window -> Preferences...
-> Plug-in Development -> Compilers
(2) Set option "Usage of non-externalized strings" to "Error" on "Plug-ins"
tab and apply
(3) Create a plug-in project using the hello world template
-> Builder shows an error
(4) Switch to "MANIFEST.MF" source page
-> Quick fix available next to "Bundle-Name" header
(5) Click quick fix
(6) Select "Externalize the Bundle-Name header"
-> Properties file key is generated and substitutes the String value
-> "null.properties" is created in the project root with the String value
in it
-> An error is still present saying that the key is not found in the
properties file
