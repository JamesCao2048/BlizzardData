Bug 461549 – [patch] [target] Dont increment sequence number during reload and provide tooltips for reload and update
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #441190 +++
Additional discussion on Bug 439034.
 We should consider having a reload button that clears the cached p2 profile, allowing the p2 sites to query the remote repositories.
We now allow this after a successful update as well as when the resolution returned an error status.
