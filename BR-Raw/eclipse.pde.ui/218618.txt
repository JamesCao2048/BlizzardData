Bug 218618 – x-friend and internal decorators incorrectly refreshed in the manifest editor
Steps to reproduce:
0/ Create a bundle with some packages inside
1/ Export a package
---> no decorator in the Exported Packages section
2/ Make the package internal changing the radio button ("hidden from all...")
---> OK, we have the 'internal' decorator
3/ Add a bundle as friend
--> KO, no refresh, the decorator is still "internal".
But OK if you close and reopen the editor.
4/ Remove all friends (when there are ones) until the package becomes an 'internal' package again
--> KO, the "friend" icon remains in the Exported Packages viewer.
4bis/ Add some friends, and then check "visible to downstream plugins", the package is still decorated as a "friend" one even if it now is a normal one.
(in fact friends are kept in memory in case we check "hidden from all..." and the "friend" flag is not computed well.
