Bug 205493 – Invalid Manifests cause multiple BundleDescription per project
If a developer modifies a Manifest so it becomes invalid and the state can no longer create a BundleDescription, we leave the old BundleDescription in the state.
 This causes multiple copies of the plug-in to be contained in the resolver state.
Steps to recreate:
1.
Open the Plug-in Dependencies View with "Show State Status" enabled, this allows you to see the current resolver state information.
2.
create a basic plug-in project with only a bundle activator
3.
create the following version range on a require bundle entry "[3.3.0,4.0)" and save the file
4.
modify the version range to "[3.3.0,4.0.a)" and save the file.
5.
modify the version range back to "[3.3.0,4.0)" and save the file
Note how there are two copies of the plug-in created in step #2.
 This is because the model manager tries create/add a new BundleDescription with the same id as the original.
 If the new BundleDescription is not created correctly, the old BundleDescription stays in the resolver state.
 When the problem is corrected we look at the cached BundleDescription (which is null) and create a new entry in the state for the bundle, hence the two copies.
