Bug 247553 – Export-Package version when creating Plug-in from existing JAR archives
When using Eclipse to develop OSGi bundles you quite often need to "osgify" external libraries.
To do this you can use "File -> New -> Project -> Plug-in Development -> Plug-in from existing JAR archives"
When plug-in is created, the "Export-Package" entries in the generated MANIFEST do not hold any version attribute.
According to OSGi R4 specs it means exported packages do have version "0.0.0" instead of having the same version as the Bundle-Version meta tag.
Missing versioning from Export-Package and Import-Package meta tags is a common issue in OSGi development and specifying them is considered as a "best practice".
It would be great if the "Plug-in from existing JAR archives" functionality would by default add version attribute to ""Export-Package" entries.
The version value would be the same as the "Bundle-Version".
