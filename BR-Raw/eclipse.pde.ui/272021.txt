Bug 272021 – [preferences] Javadoc the PDEPreferencesManager
The new preferences manager in PDE aims to streamline the usage of preferences in PDE (bug 264394).
 Unfortunately, even though it is now used throughout the platform it is not documented properly.
 New classes, especially those used throughout the component, should have javadoc to ensure they are used correctly.
