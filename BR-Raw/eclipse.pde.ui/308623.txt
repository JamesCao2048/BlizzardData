Bug 308623 – IPluginModelBase.getBuildModel() always returns null
I am using the following code:
IPluginModelBase pluginModel = PluginRegistry.findModel(project);
IBuildModel buildModel = pluginModel.getBuildModel();
buildModel is always null here.
This is the only API I found to get IBuildModel.
Am I missing something?
