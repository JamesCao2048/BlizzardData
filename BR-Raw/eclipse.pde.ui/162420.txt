Bug 162420 – OSGi Console view
A Plugin that lets you launch an OSGi Console from the console view, while Eclipse is running.
Requires changes to org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.FrameworkConsole and FrameworkCommandProvider (Bug 162415).
The plugin creates a FrameworkConsole, and extends IOConsole, then sends it's input to the framework, and takes FrameworkCOnsole's ouput.
Then it registers itself with the IConsoleManager.
It overrides the dispose() method to close the FrameworkConsole, then close normally.
