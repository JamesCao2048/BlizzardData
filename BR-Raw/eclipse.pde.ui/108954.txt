Bug 108954 – Error at project creation - no manifest file created with classpath contains '&'
To reproduce (on Windows):
1) Use plug-in project creation wizard
2) On the second page ("Plug-in content" page), enter classpath containing '&',
such as "abc&.jar"
3) Click on "Finish".
The project is created, but there is no manifest.mf file under the project
resource.
The editor attempts to open manifest file, with the following message
displayed: "File project_name/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF does not exist".
If '&' is not allowed in the jar name, some validation is needed to prevent
wizard to go forward.
