Bug 391828 – TargetEnvironmentTestCase tests fail locally
The tests have been around for some time and it became accepted fact that they were flaky when run locally.
org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests.target.TargetEnvironmentTestCase.testStateDictionaryNumber()
Debugging through this test shows that the state's platform properties have nothing to do with the known execution environments.
 This test is not comparing anything useful.
 The platform properties have an execution environment property.
 However, it is a list of supported execution environments.
 The list of execution environments is given to us directly from JavaRuntime.
I'm proposing to delete this test.
org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests.target.TargetEnvironmentTestCase.testExecutionEnvironment()
This test is very similar in that it pulls the state's platform properties and checks for execution environments.
 This is not necessary as PDE never collects execution environment information from the state.
 Also, the test isn't actually testing that the properties contain all the execution environemnts, it simply checks that all sets of properties have an execution environment.
 This fails locally because the jdt debug tests have a test profile called 'systempackage' that I have copied below.
{org.osgi.framework.os.name=win32, osgi.resolveOptional=true, osgi.os=win32, org.osgi.framework.language=en, osgi.nl=en_CA, org.osgi.framework.processor=x86, osgi.arch=x86, osgi.resolverMode=development, osgi.system.bundle=org.eclipse.osgi, osgi.ws=win32, org.osgi.framework.system.packages=one.two,three.four}
This test should also be deleted.
***
If we were concerned about the contents of our state's properties, we could craft a test to do a better comparison.
 However, in PDE we never need the state properties describing EE profiles so I recommend just removing the tests.
