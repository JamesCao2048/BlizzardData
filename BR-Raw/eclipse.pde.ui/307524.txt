Bug 307524 – Using org.eclipse.wst.xml_* makes the Plug-in Manifest Editor unreliable
I have an installation where I use the XML-Editor provided by the org.eclipse.wst.xml_* features.
With that the PDE Manifest Editor no longer works reliably:
- Opening a plugin.xml for the first time, the outline view "flickers" a few
seconds
- Copy and pasting an XML snippet in the plugin.xml source editor tab
does not syntax-highlight the new snippet.
- Editing the plugin.xml source directly is not immediately reflected in the
Extensions tab
- Using the Extensions tab to edit a dirty plugin.xml is unreliable.
 The XML
content gets easily distorted.
The reason seems to be that the 'org.eclipse.wst.xml.core' plugin specifies an IDocumentFactory that ends up creating the document for the plugin.xml file.
