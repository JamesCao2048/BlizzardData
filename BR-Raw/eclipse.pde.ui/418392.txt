Bug 418392 – PDE Build's dependency on runtime compatibility should not be optional
At least, that was one suggestion coming from bug 415008 comment 65.
There might be other, more "direct" solutions (such as to "require" the "compatibility.state" bundle? Or ...
to avoid the need for even that?
I forget where we "left" that issue, but wanted to open this bug to track it.
Let me know if I am mis-remembering.
Thanks,
