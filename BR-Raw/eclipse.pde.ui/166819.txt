Bug 166819 – Renaming project's name won't be renamed Bundle-SymbolicName
When you rename a project's name in PDE, the Bundle-SymbolicName of manifest won't be renamed (also ID in manifest editor overview won't be renamed).
Also when you copy a project into another, the new project contains the same Bundle-SymbolicName (and ID).
Sometimes it causes trouble.
Renaming Bundle-SymbolicName and ID automatically might be preferred.
What do you think ?
