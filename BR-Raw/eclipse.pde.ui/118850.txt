Bug 118850 – PDE Launcher does not put the "program arguments" at the end of the command line arguments
The PDE Launcher does not put the "program arguments" at the end of the command arguments.
This breaks the antRunner application since it expects the ant script target to be at the end of the command line.
Scenario:
Take a project with a build script
Try to run the antRunner in the runtime workbench picking a target other then the defaultTarget.
This makes it difficult to run anything that wants to use antRunner and the runtime workbench.
