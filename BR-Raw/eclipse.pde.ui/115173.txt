Bug 115173 – Help template is missing
Hi!
The help template is missing as "favorite" when creating a new project
It is only choosable by using the custom template wizard
If I do not want to use a UI contribution (which is not necessaryly needed for
help) I can't choose a template at all
Also no dependency to org.eclipse.help is added to the manifest.
It would be a greate idea to add a posibility to add all dependencies needed for
a standalone help.
(Missing help-plugins is one of the most common error when
adding help to a rcp app)
The required plugins are:
org.eclipse.help
org.eclipse.help.appserver,
org.eclipse.help.base
org.eclipse.help.webapp,
org.eclipse.help.ui
org.apache.lucene,
org.eclipse.core.runtime
org.eclipse.core.expressions
org.eclipse.jface
org.eclipse.ui.workbench
org.eclipse.update.configurator
AFAIK, at least for Win and Linux
Thanks a lot
Bernd
