Bug 152059 – Warning in build.properties about plugin.xml not listed when using wildcards
I20060725-0800
I have the following in my build.properties:
source.helptests.jar=src/
bin.includes = data/,\
livehelp/,\
nl/,\
about.html,\
*.xml,\
doc.zip,\
plugin.properties,\
*.bat,\
*.jar,\
META-INF/
bin.excludes=build.xml
I get the following warning:
Severity and Description	Path	Resource	Location	Creation Time	Id
An entry for plugin.xml is required in bin.includes	org.eclipse.help.tests	build.properties	line 12	1154030652621	47219
However the *.xml entry covers this file, it's just not listed individually.
