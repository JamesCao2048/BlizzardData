Bug 198050 – [Manifest][Editor] schema file deleted on extension point delete, not restored on revert
- Open the manifest editor to the Extension Points page.
- Delete an extension point.
- Say yes to the dialog asking if you want to delete the schema too.
- Revert the editor or close without saving.
BUG: The extension point is restored to the file, but the schema is still deleted.
The contents of the deleted schemas should be held in buffers until the changes are saved or the editor is reverted/disposed.
If the extension point delete is reverted, the file should be restored.
