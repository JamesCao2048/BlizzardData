Bug 277611 – [target] Target Platform brings plugins back from previous installations
...installed Riena RC1 into my target using PDE Target Platform Definition via Updatesite.
worked well, all bundles there - also all .source bundles
but I dont get the sources per ex.
if hovering about a classname.
...nothing attached...
but the .sorce bundles are there and I can import them into workspace and can see the sources.
all other .source bundles (like equinox) are well recognized from target platform
