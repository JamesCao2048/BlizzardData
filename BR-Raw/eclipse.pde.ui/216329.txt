Bug 216329 – [api tooling] Refactoring participants required for filters
In our code we have many places that record/cache/persist qualified names/sigatures/etc.
for reuse.
If a refactoring is done on one of these referenced types then the cached information about the (previous) type is stale and never gets removed.
We need to add in refactoring participants for:
1.
api descriptions, for package/type/member rename/signature changes
2.
api filters, for package/type/member rename/signature changes
