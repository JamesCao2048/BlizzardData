Bug 183070 – [Plug-in Dependencies View] Show Optional does not work in table mode
1.
Focus on org.eclipse.pde.junit.runtime.
2.
Show callees in hierarchy mode.
 Looks fine.
3.
Now deselect 'Show optional dependencies' in the drop down menu.
 org.eclipse.ui should vanish.
 Fine.
4.
Switch to Table Mode.
 You now see a list that filters out org.eclipse.ui but includes all the dependencies of org.eclipse.ui, which is not correct.
5.
Now switch to Tree mode.
 Toggling 'show optional dependencies' does nothing anymore.
