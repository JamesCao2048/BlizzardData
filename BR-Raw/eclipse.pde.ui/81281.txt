Bug 81281 – automatically add target plugins to Java search?
Would it make sense to (optionally) add all the plugins in the target to the
Java search path?
Currently when you manage your target and add plugins you then have to go and
open a Plugins view (which means you need to know that such a thing exists),
select the newly added plugins (or some superset) and say Add to Java Search.
Failure to do this results in somewhat incomplete search results and some
confusion for the developer.
Perhaps either there could be an Add to Java Search button in the prefs page or
an option to simply have PDE manage the Java Search additions/removals.
 Are
there any problems with the latter approach?  The eliminates two more things
(Plugins view and Java Search Path) that normal developers have to know
about/manage.
Would we have to add only the ones that are not shadowed by workspace plugins
to prevent duplicate search results?
