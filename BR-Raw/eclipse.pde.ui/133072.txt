Bug 133072 – Cannot launch an "Eclipse Application" without the -ws argument
When trying to launch an Eclipse Application that does NOT use SWT under OSX from 3.1 or 3.2M5, you get the following problems:
When running against 1.4.2_09, you get the dreaded "2006-03-23
15:35:27.340 java[1053] Apple AWT Java VM was loaded on first thread
-- can't start AWT."  The application then stops.
When running against 1.5.0_06 you get these messages on startup:
2006-03-23 15:29:59.468 java[1047] [Java CocoaComponent compatibility
mode]: Enabled
2006-03-23 15:29:59.468 java[1047] [Java CocoaComponent compatibility
mode]: Setting timeout for SWT to 0.100000
Under 1.5.0_06, the app appears to run, but there is no menu-bar,
dock-icon, or window that shows up.
 Basically nothing happens, but
the event thread is running and you have to kill it.
Under 3.0 (i think) you used to be able to tell Eclipse not to force
any "first-thread" flags by not passing the -ws carbon flag to the
application.
 However, it appears that we no longer have the ability to suppress that flag.
We hacked around this by removing the check for the "-ws" flag in the  org.eclipse.jdt.internal.launching.macosx.MacOSXVMInstall.java class and rebuilding that plugin.
 But this is not a good all-around solution.
 Better would be to be able to override and not pass the -ws flag at all if we wanted to per Launch configuration.
Here's the test class we used:
package Fred;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;
import org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPlatformRunnable;
public class Main implements IPlatformRunnable {
public Object run(Object args) throws Exception {
SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
public void run() {
new JFrame("Fred").setVisible(true);
}
});
synchronized(this)
{
wait();
}
return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_OK;
}
}
