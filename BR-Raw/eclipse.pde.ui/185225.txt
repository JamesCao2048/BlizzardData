Bug 185225 – State of State view doesn't refresh with plug-in changes
Wassim found this bug during testing.
 It appears the fool who developed the State of State view must have just blindly forgot to implement IPluginModelChangeListener.
 This causes the view to become out of sync with the actual state of the state very quickly.
