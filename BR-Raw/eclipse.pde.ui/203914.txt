Bug 203914 – jars.extra.classpath should not mark entries starting with ANT variables as Errors
This was found when going through the use case for bug 203375.
 User should be able to use ANT variables to reference jars in the extra.jars.classpath property in the build.properties.
 Right now, if the user does this there is an error.
 We should treat this the same way as we do when validating bin.includes and not mark it as an error.
