Bug 278818 – [target] duplicate bundles appear when restoring state
3.5 RC3
The LoadTargetDefinitionJob automatically removes duplicate bundles when creating target platform state (fixed by bug 274225).
However, when state is restored on workspace restart, duplicates are not removed - PDE just scans all locations.
