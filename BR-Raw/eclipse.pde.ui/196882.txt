Bug 196882 – [Schema][Editors] Remove "Label Property" and "Icon" fields from "Element Details" section
Problems:
(1) Nobody understands what these fields are for
(2) These fields make the details section of elements more cluttered
(3) The fields only affect the presentation of elements in the manifest
editor Extensions tree viewer (icon and name)
-> This should be calculated dynamically rather than having to
specified manually
Criteria:
For the element's presentation name, the element's first translatable attribute of type string should be used.
For the element's presentation icon, the element's first attribute of type resource should be used.
Recommendation:
I think the easiest and cleanest way to do this is to update the element's schema annotation everytime a new attribute is added (in the schema editor) only if a value has not already been specified:
<appInfo>
<meta.element labelAttribute="name" icon="icon"/>
</appInfo>
Care has to be taken to preserve values already specified that do not meet the specified criteria above.
