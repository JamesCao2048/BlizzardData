Bug 170516 – [Schema][Editors][Actions] Preview Reference Document should offer to save file
Create a PDE schema file "schemaTest.exsd" extension, give it some content and save.
Now make some more changes without saving the editor.
From the package explorer right click on schemaTest.exsd and select
PDE Tools/Preview Reference Document
Expected result: I am asked if I want to first save the file.
Actual result: The last saved version is previewed and the unsaved changes do not show.
