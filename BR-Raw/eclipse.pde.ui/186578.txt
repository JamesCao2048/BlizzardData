Bug 186578 – Should Plug-ins view have "Show In" as one menu with submenus?
3.3 N0510
The Package Explorer and other navigators have one "Show In" menu, with a submenu with entries for each of the different target views.
The Plug-ins view has two menus, "Show in Resource Navigator" and "Show in Package Explorer".
It would be good to have some consistency in this regard and I'd suggest we follow the Package Explorer pattern, since a submenu makes it easier to add targets and takes up less top level menu space.
Thus:
1.
 The plug-ins view should be one menu with a submenu with "Navigator" and "Packapge Explorer".
2.
 The Show-In menu should probably be bound to Alt-Shift-W like in the Package Explorer.
