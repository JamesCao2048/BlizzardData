Bug 186701 – Target Environment Amnesia
Latest code from HEAD
1.
Create a Hello World plug-in project
2.
Change the os/ws target environment on the preference page to linux/gtk
3.
Observe how the Hellow world plug-in now has compiler errors, since the swt.win32 fragment is now unresolved and not on the classpath.
 Good.
4.
 Shut down and restart.
 The hello world plug-in is now fine.
 It is expected to still have errors.
