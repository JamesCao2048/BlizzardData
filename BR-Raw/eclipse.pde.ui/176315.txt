Bug 176315 – whackiness with dependencies view
in i0228
I was playing around with targets and ended up in a situtation where I had javax.servlet and org.eclipse.equinox.servlet.api in different parts of the target.
 Both export javax.servlet (the package).
 I have another bundle B that imports that package using something like.
 Note that the service.http reference comes from the org.eclipse.osgi.services bundle.
Import-Package: javax.servlet,
javax.servlet.http,
org.osgi.service.http
When I looked at the plugin dependencies view and focused on B I did not see either of these as a direct child.
Rather, javax.servlet (the bundle) was listed as a child under org.eclipse.osgi.services.
 This is strange because services does not reexport the pakcages that B needs.
Ok, whatever.
 javax.servlet the bundle is bugging me (causing some compilatin problems) so I delete it from the target (as in from the dir on disk that the target definition points to) and reload, refresh, spin around twice.
 My compilation errors went away but the plugin dependeince view still showed javax.servlet (now with a red X on it).
 There does not seem to be anything I can do to make it go away.
Related to this, it is kind of confusing that the dependencies view shows dependents that are not in the current target or workspace.
 The plugins view seems to have filters that will show just this subset of the universe and the Focus on...
selection list shows just that set as well.
