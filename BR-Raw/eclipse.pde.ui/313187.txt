Bug 313187 – OpenSchemaAction does not handle locations with spaces in it
1) Open an Eclipse that is installed at a path with a space in it
2) Create a plug-in project,add an extension that comes from the default target platform
3) Select the extension and click "Open extension point schema"
Result:
Nothing happens, no error dialog, no schema is opened
Two fixes should be made:
1) OpenSchemaAction.run(), line 192 and 194, where we get a path from the url we should use the URIUtils to correctly handle spaces and other special characters.
2) Inside openSchemaFile and openSchemaJar, we should check that the file exists and report an error if it doesn't.
