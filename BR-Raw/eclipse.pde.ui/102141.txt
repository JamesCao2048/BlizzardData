Bug 102141 – X.P. schema should indicate if dependency is required
Some extension points require that extending plug-ins declare dependency on
the plug-in declaring the extension point.
 In other cases, where extension
can be viewed as optional, or does not provide code, the dependency is not
necessary.
To help PDE determine what is the case, the extension point schema could
contain information if given extension point requires dependency from
extenders.
