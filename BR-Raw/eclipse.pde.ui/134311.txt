Bug 134311 – No validation done for Java project source/output folders in New Plug-in Project Wizard
The source and output folder fields in the New Plug-in Project Wizard are not validated in any way within the wizard.
 If you enter invalid characters into the folder name (* for example), no error is shown, and the wizard allows you to continue to the next page.
 If you hit Finish, the Wizard partially completes creating the project, then pops up an error dialog "* is an invalid character in resource name src*"  The wizard does not exit after this error - and if you go back and fix the problem then try Finish again, it'll complain that a project with that name already exists.
These fields should be validated like the Project name field is.
