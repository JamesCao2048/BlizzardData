Steps to reproduce:
1.
create a new product
2.
base the product on features

add three features.
 Arrange the features so the last feature will be sorted to the top (ex.
org.eclipse.pde.source, org.eclipse.jdt, org.eclipse.cvs).
4.
Select the last feature.
 Note how the up button is enabled and the down button is disabled.
5.
Sort using action in section header
6.
Unsort using action in section header
Result: order and selection is restored to same state as step 4, except the down button is now enabled and the up button is disabled.
