Bug 264696 – [target] No information on current target if backing target definition file deleted
Steps:
1) Create a new target definition in local metadata
2) Set it as the target platform
3) Close Eclipse
4) Delete the backing target definition in pde.core metadata
5) Open Eclipse, open target preference page
Result:
Nothing is selected, but there is still a target platform.
Once we remove the old target platform preference page we will have to handle this case where something happens to the fiel backing the current target platform.
 We should probably log an exception and create a new target platform based on the current settings.
This should happen for workspace files as well.
 If we add support to open external files and set them as the target platform this problem will get worse (bug 264056).
