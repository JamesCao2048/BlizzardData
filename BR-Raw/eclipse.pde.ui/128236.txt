Bug 128236 – [Manifest Editor] Opening plugin.xml then Manifest.mf no longer shares same editor
build I20060216-0800
- open the plugin.xml in a plugin project (e.g.
org.eclipse.ui)
- it opens the manifest editor
- open the Manifest.mf
- it opens a second manifest editor
- open the build.properties
- it reuses the second editor
Expectation:
- only one manifest editor is opened, and it's reused for all 3 files
Separate issue: this expectation also breaks down if build.properties is opened first, as it still opens a dedicated build properties editor if there was no matching manifest editor.
 So opening build.properties then plugin.xml has a different effect than opening plugin.xml then build.properties.
