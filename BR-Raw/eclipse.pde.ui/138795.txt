Bug 138795 – Presentation names for features
I am trying to display the translated feature presentation names, but it does not appear to be working.
 Displaying plug-in names works fine though.
 Here are the calls I am making:
IFeatureModel model = PDECore.getDefault().getFeatureModelManager().findFeatureModel(((ITargetFeature)obj).getId());
IFeature feature = model.getFeature();
if (feature != null && isFullNameModeEnabled()) {
return (((FeatureObject)feature).getTranslatableLabel());
}
return super.getText(obj);
It seems that getTranslatableLabel always returns the %feature.name key from the feature.xml file.
 I traced through the code and eventually AbstractModel.createNLResourceHelper() gets called, but it simply returns null.
 Is this the expected behavior?  Can you recommend another way to get the translated feature name from the target platform by starting with the feature id or the associated ITargetFeature?
I looked at the feature import process (import external feature from target platform), but it does not seem to honor the presentation name preference either.
 I did not trace it, but I would guess it is the same or a similar problem.
