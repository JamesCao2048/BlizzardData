Bug 270626 – [target] Change UI to separate content and location tabs
When creating the UI we thought we could simplify the UI by having targets always broken down by the locations they came from.
 So the contents of targets were displayed as a tree of locations with the plug-ins they contained as children.
Unfortunately several cases have been brought up where users want to work with plug-ins in the target as one large group.
 Features like "Select required", group by physical location, etc.
require a different UI.
There are a few other benefits to having separate tabs/sections for locations and content.
 We will require one less level of modal dialog to edit plug-in content.
 The display will more closely match what will eventually end up in the state.
