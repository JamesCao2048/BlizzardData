Bug 153093 – Inconsistent placement of labels in update site editor
In the update site editor, in the Site Map tab, if you select a category it shows name, label, and description fields to the right.
However the description field is centered vertically with its text field.
In the Archives tab you also have a description field, but this one is aligned with the top of its text field.
I would suggest always aligning with the top as it's easier to read (at least for me).
See screenshot.
