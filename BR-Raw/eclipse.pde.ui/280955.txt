Bug 280955 – Don't make Activator extend Plugin by default
Build: 3.5
I have a simple bundle with no dependency on org.eclipse.core.runtime.
If I click the "Activator" hyperlink in the Overview tab of the manifest editor, it opens the new Class wizard with the superclass set to "org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin".
We are trying to encourage people to convert to the OSGi practice of simply extending BundleActivator.
Dependency on Plugin and org.eclipse.core.runtime pulls in lots of extra baggage that an "OSGi-clean" bundle will often want to avoid.
In general I think the PDE tools should encourage best practices and avoid adding gratuitous dependencies, so I suggest changing this to simply implement BundleActivator instead.
