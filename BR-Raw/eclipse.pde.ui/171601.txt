Bug 171601 – Remove internal references to Java preferences
To be a good platform citizen, PDE currently reuses the JDT color preferences for their plain properties editor to color the build.properties file.
This is fine, but we currently access the jdt preferences via JavaPlugin.getDefault().getCombinedPreferenceStore(...) which is internal.
After consulting with our friend DJ, the preferred way to access other plug-in's preferences is via
Platform.getPreferencesService().getString("org.eclipse.jdt.ui", KEY, null, null)
