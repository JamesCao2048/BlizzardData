Bug 109003 – editing a plugin.xml located in subfolder of a plugin project, edits the MANIFEST.MF at the root
I have a plugin for testing of assembly and build.
It contains multiple
subfolders that replicate the structure of a plugin (they are test plugins, i.e.
test data for some tests): each contains a plugin.xml and a MANIFEST subfolder
containing a MANIFEST.MF.
They are "new style
If I open a "plugin.xml" from one of the subfolders in the plugin manifest
editor, the associated MANIFEST.MF that gets opened is not the one in the
MANIFEST subfolder corresponding to the plugin.xml, but instead the MANIFEST.MF
that lives in the MANIFEST subfolder of the project root.
The expected default behavior would be that the editor would take the
MANIFEST.MF relatively to the plugin.xml being edited.
