Bug 250340 – [API] Create template method in JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate
The JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate#collectExecutionArguments() figures out the application to be launched by introspecting and applying a set of heuristics.
SWTBot needs that tests run in a non-UI thread, which is why it needs to launch another application (internal to SWTBot) and point that application to the application that the user selects.
In order to do this the application in the case of SWTBot is always hardcoded to the application ID of swtbottestapplication.
This patch extracts the piece of code that determines the application id, into a protected method so that clients can override it to provide another application id.
Patch follows.
