Bug 125913 – New Extension dialog should give default focus to filter text field
I20060125-0800
- Open plugin manifest editor
- Switch to Extensions tab
- Click Add...
Keyboard focus on the resulting dialog is set on the list, rather than the text field, so I can't just type in the id.
I have to first click on the text field.
Elsewhere in eclipse it brings keyboard focus to the logical starting field..
see new java project/class/package toolbar buttons to see what I mean.
