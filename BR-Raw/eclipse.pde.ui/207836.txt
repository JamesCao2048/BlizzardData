Bug 207836 – Search results for extension point references don't always appear right for multiple versions
When a user has two plug-ins with the same Bundle-SymbolicName but different versions, the extension point search doesn't work correctly.
To recreate:
1.
Create plug-in project with version 1.0.0, using the Commands template
2.
Create another plug-in project with the same Bundle-SymbolicName as the first but with version 2.0.0, using the Commands template again.
3.
Do a plug-ins search for references to *.commands.
You should see two results (one for version 1.0.0 and one for version 2.0.0).
 Double click on each result.
 Some times they open up separate editors, but most times they open the same editor.
 If they do open the same editor, re-run the search.
