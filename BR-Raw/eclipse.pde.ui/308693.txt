Bug 308693 – Filter workspace features if target is managed using features
1) Create a target pointing at the Eclipse install
2) On the content tab, select manage using features
3) Deselect everything except one feature
4) Set the target as the active target platform
5) Open a new Eclipse launch config
6) On the plug-ins/content tab use "selected features below"
Result:
All features in the installation are visible in the table.
We should filter the list of features in the model manager if the user is managing the target by features and a subset is selected.
