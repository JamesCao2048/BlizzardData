Bug 488805 – DSAnnotationCompilationParticipant performs unnecessary model modification
This is in follow-up to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488440.
In cases when there have been no added or removed descriptor files in a given build (in buildFinished), the participant still performs a project modification operation; this operation won't find any changes and won't modify the model in the end, but still performs unnecessary model loading, setup, etc.
when we already know that there are no changes to reconcile.
