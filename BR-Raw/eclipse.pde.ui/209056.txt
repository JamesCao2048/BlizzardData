Bug 209056 – config.ini generated for eclipse launch configuration does not work against a p2 target
Setup:
- A 3.4 M3 p2 provisioned SDK
- Target platform set to its default value (in this case the bundle pool)
When in this setup I create an eclipse launch configuration (or PDE Junit one), my  instance does not come up.
The reason is because no applications are registered and this stemmed from the *non* started state of org.eclipse.core.runtime.
My guess:
- PDE is not generating the proper config.ini
- PDE does not have the information to generate the proper config.ini because it does not find the config.ini.
