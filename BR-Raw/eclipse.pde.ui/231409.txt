Bug 231409 – Conversion of org.eclipse.update.core is causing weird results
When convertion this bundle, the api restriction tags inside the type org.eclipse.update.configuration.IActivity are duplicated and you can find:
@noextend null multiple times.
This should be fixed to help people to convert.
