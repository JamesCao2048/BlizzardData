Bug 312495 – BundleProjectDescription.apply() very slow on 1st call in clean workspace
Build Identifier: 3.6.0.v20100405
I am working on an adopting product which calls org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.project.BundleProjectDescription.apply() when creating a new project.
I am investigating a performance issue where the first new project created in a clean workspace takes approximately 2 minutes to complete, compared to roughly o.5s for subsequent projects.
I gathered some profiling data which indicated that 66s was spent in BundleProjectDescription.apply() (screenshot attached).
Is there any possibility of speeding this up, or deferring the majority of the work to a background thread to release the UI?
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Regrettably I don't know how to reproduce this problem in eclipse.
With our adopting product, the problem can be reproduced by:
1.
start with a clean workspace
2.
create a new project
