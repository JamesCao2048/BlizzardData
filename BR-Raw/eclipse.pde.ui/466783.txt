Bug 466783 – [apitools] Add New API Baseline wizard opened with wrong parent shell
Build Id: 4.5.0.I20150506-2000
Found another location in ApiBaselinePreferencePage wrongly using ApiUIPlugin#getShell() to set the parent shell for a dialog.
1.
Window > Preferences > Plug-in Development > API Baselines
2.
Click on Add Baseline
3.
Hit escape
Focus does not go back to the Preferences dialog.
Only seen on Windows; OS X seems to do the right thing.
