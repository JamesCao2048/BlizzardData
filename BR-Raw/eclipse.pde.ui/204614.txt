Bug 204614 – Validate more versions in Manifest
When a user specifies an invalid version in the new Fragment wizard, it gets flagged as an invalid format.
 If they enter the same version into the Manifest Editor, we mark an error on the Form editor but do not mark the error on the source page.
These version format errors result in the Manifest not registering correctly with the resolver state.
 Since this is the case, we should do our best to inform the user when they have a problem with their versions so they may be able to better utilize PDE tooling.
Same should be done for the Import-Package and Require-Bundle since version formatting errors in these headers also cause problems when registering the Manifest.
