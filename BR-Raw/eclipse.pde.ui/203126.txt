Bug 203126 – [WorkingSets] Allow location of WorkingSetConfigurationBlock to be changed by implementors
I really like the new WorkingSetConfigurationBlock.
 I think it can be very handy for many users.
The one thing I would like to see, is to allow others who extend the Platform's Wizards to place the location of the WorkingSetConfigurationBlock where they would like.
 The current implementation forces the working set block after the project creation block.
 For PDE, it would be nice to be able to move the working set block down on the page, similar to JDT's new project wizard.
