Bug 198965 – Feature Editor does not find feature dependencies correctly
When specifying a dependency on a feature in the Feature Editor on the Dependencies tab, the outline is updated.
 If there is a feature which PDE is tracking that meets the version and match rule, the outline's icon is created with no error.
 But when no feature can be found that satisfies the version constraint, a little red X appears on the icon.
Unfortunately, the validation for this is not working correctly.
 Add a dependency on a 3.3.0 feature.
 By default the version to match will be 3.3.0.....
 Change the version to match to 3.2.0.
 Then change the Match rule to 'Compatible'.
 Since the current 3.3.0 version is compatible with 3.2.0, no X should appear, but it does.
 Then change the version to match to 3.4.0.
 Note how this version is not compatible, yet the red X disappears.
