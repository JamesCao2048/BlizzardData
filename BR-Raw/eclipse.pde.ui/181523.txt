Bug 181523 – [Plug-in Dependencies View] Sorting is not correct
In the Plug-in Dependencies view,
1.
Focus on 'org.eclipse.core.expressions'
2.
Show Callees/Flat layout.
Note how org.eclipse.osgi.services is listed before org.eclipse.osgi
this is, of course, because a '.' is lexicographically smaller than a space.
We should use ListUtil.PluginComparator to sort.
