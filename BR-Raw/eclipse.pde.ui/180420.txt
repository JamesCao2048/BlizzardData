Bug 180420 – New Plug-in wizard defaults are biased toward plug-in development
There are a couple of settings in the New Plug-in Project wizard that should be persisted from one invocation of the wizard to the next to make for a friendlier workflow.
1.
The Eclipse Platform vs the OSGi framework choice on the first choice.
OSGi developers currently always have to change this selection.
2.
The selected values in the combo boxes should also be selected.
There are settings that we can persist on the second page, e.g.
whether or not an activator is needed or whether it is a UI plug-in or not, but this can be done for extra credit as I am not sure how annoying this part is, if at all.
