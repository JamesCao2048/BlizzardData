Bug 198961 – Feature's dependency calculations include too much
The Feature Editor has a compute button on the dependencies page.
 This button is suppose to calculate the dependencies of the plug-ins contained in the feature.
Unfortunately, some times a dependency is added when a plug-in is included in the feature which already satisfies the constraint.
Test:
1.
Create new plug-in project.
2.
Add 'org.eclipse.ant' as a required bundle.
 Mark the version range as [1.7.0-2.0.0).
3.
Create a new feature
4.
Add the plug-in project from step one into the feature on the plug-ins tab.
5.
Add 'org.eclipse.ant' to the same table.
6.
Go to the dependencies page and hit 'compute'.
 This adds org.eclipse.ant as a dependency.
 Since the version of org.eclipse.ant on the plug-ins page is 0.0.0, this is working correctly.
7.
Now go back to the plug-ins tab.
 Select org.eclipse.ant and change the specified version in the Plug-in Details Section to 1.8.0.
 This should satisfy the constraint of [1.7.0 - 2.0.0).
8.
Go to the dependencies page and hit compute.
 Note how org.eclipse.ant is not removed from the dependencies list.
 The feature contains a version which satisfies the dependency, so the org.eclipse.ant dependency should be removed.
9.
go back to the plug-ins tab.
 Select org.eclipse.ant and change the specified version in the Plug-in Details Section to 1.6.0.
 This will NOT satisfy the constraint of [1.7.0-2.0.0).
10.
Go to the dependencies page and hit compute.
Note how org.eclipse.ant is removed from the dependency list.
