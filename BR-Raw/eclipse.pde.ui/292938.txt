Bug 292938 – "Open extension point schema" link fails in plugin.xml editor
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.1; U; de) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.00
Build Identifier: 20090619-0625
In the plugin.xml editor the link "Open extension point schema" does not work under conditions described in steps to reproduce.
A warning message is presented: "Extension point schema for extension point <extpointname> cannot be found." (where <extpointname> is the name of the new extension point enclosed in quotes)
Also tested under Windows 2000, maybe all platforms are affected.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Add a new extension point in the plugin.xml editor in tab "Extension Points" (keep the "Edit extension point schema when done" checked) -> the extension point schema editor opens fine and is activated
2.
Close the extension point schema editor without doing any changes to the schema -> the plugin.xml editor is activate again
3.
Try to open extension point schema using the link "Open extension point schema" -> warning message, schema editor does not open
