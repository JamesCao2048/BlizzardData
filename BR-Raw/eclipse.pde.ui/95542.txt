Bug 95542 – PDE should not attempt to add external folder to classpath
3.1M7
JDT does not support external folders.
 If a fragment declares a folder as a
library and the fragment is not in the workspace, PDE currently attempts to
add it to the classpath (as it should).
 However, JDT chokes on it.
therefore, to avoid this unpleasantness, PDE should add the following
check/workaround:  If the external library is a folder, don't add it.
 It is
not correct, but better than what is happening today.
