Bug 179401 – Shells created by some launcher buttons has wrong parents
The "Workspace..." and "Variables..." and "Installed JREs..." buttons create shells who have the wrong parent.
 To test, use Alt key to trigger button, type ESC and then try the same Alt key combo.
 Since the focus is not on the right shell, the key combo will not work.
