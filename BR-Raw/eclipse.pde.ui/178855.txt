Bug 178855 – [refactoring] Cannot finish after trying to rename project to existing project
the new plug-in refactoring functionality allows users to update their project name to the name as the new plug-in id.
 Since we are changing project names, there is a chance the destination exists already.
 I encountered this problem and was able to display an error when the user tried to go rename the project to an existing project.
 Unfortunately, I was not able to fully test it.
When the user tries to update the project name to an existing project, they see a new error page in the wizard that allows them to go back.
 Unfortunately, after they go back the wizard never enables the OK button again so they have to exit and restart.
