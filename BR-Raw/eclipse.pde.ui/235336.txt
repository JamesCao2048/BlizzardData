Bug 235336 – [p2] cannot compile against plugins referenced via .link files
Build ID: I20080530-1730
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Use a .link file to integrate another plugin into the platform
2.
Run Eclipse and verify with Help -> About Eclipse SDK -> Plugin Details that the plugin is indeed available
3.
Create a new Plugin in the workbench
4.
In the MANIFEST.MF editor, try to set a dependency to the plugin that was integrated with the .link file
4) will not work, the dialog will not even display the plugin.
If you add the dependency textually, it will still not work, as the classpath will not be resolved.
If this is not supposed to work, then I suggest updating
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox_p2_Getting_Started#Links_Folder
which says "For backwards compatibility the links folder is supported by p2 with the same behavior.".
