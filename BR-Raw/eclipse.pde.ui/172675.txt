Bug 172675 – Name, Provider form fields on fragment overview page not updated when externalization quick fix applied
Eclipse version > Build id: I20070130-0800
Steps To Reproduce:
(1) Create a fragment project
(2) Set the externalized strings compiler option to Error
Windows -> Preferences -> Plug-in Development -> Compilers -> Usage of
Non-Externalized Strings
(3) Go to MANIFEST.MF source page
(4) Click on quick fix associated with the Bundle-Name header
-> Select Externalize Bundle-Name header
-> Externalization works well
(5) Switch to Overview Page
-> Notice the "Name" field in the "General Information" section still
contains the non-externalized
(6) Type some text in another field and click in another field
-> Note: The externalized string key now appears in the "Name" field
-> This problem is also applicable to the "Provider" field
-> However, this problem does not occur if it is a plug-in project
- only on fragment projects
From my investigation, it simply looks like a model changed event is not being
fired.
 Because the modelChanged method in the GeneralInformationSection is
not recieving any event to trigger the refresh.
