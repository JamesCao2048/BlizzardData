Bug 296457 – Problems with new problems and quick fixes for build.properties
N20091129-2000
The new Quick Fixes for build.properties (bug 253950, bug 154292) need some polish:
- Quick fix label should not have a '.' at the end
- 'Add all...' is missing the '+' image
- check out org.eclipse.core.expressions with tag v20090429-1800
=> order of the quick fixes should be predictable (I've seen different order in different workspaces)
- execute quick fix 'Add bin/ to the output..
build entry.'
=> after this, quick fix 'Add all missing java compiler build entries.' is redundant and should not be shown
- revert build.properties to version from CVS
- execute quick fix 'Add all missing java compiler build entries.'
=> only "jre.compilation.profile = J2SE-1.3" got added
=> there's still an error: "The 'jre.compilation.profile' build entry does not match the 'Compiler compliance level' project setting.".
That sentence is wrong, since the compiler compliance DOES match the entry.
Maybe this is about the EE.
Please fix the message or the error detection.
=> the 'Change the value...' quick fix does nothing
