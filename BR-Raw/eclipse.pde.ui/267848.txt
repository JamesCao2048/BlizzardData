Bug 267848 – PDE illegally complains about non-externalized strings
I20090310-0100, broken since 3.5 M4.
PDE illegally complains about non-externalized strings in old plug-ins (i.e.
those which do not have a MANIFEST.MF.
This used to work up to 3.5 M3.
While I understand that my pug-in does not use the newest format, I have no clue from PDE why I now get these warnings.
There is no warning/error saying that my plug-in is outdated.
