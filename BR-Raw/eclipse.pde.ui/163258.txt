Bug 163258 – Bundle-Localization Manifest Header not honored by plugin.xml editor
I'm seeing that if a Bundle-Localization other than the default of plugin.properties is specified in the MANIFEST.MF of a project, the plugin.xml editor no longer displays the value for any keys that were entered as attribute values.
For example, I have a project that specifies the Bundle-Localization in it's MANIFEST.MF as follows:
Bundle-Localization: OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle
I've created a a bundle.properties file in the OSGI-INF/l10n/ folder at the root of my project with the following content:
view.label=My View
Then, in the plug-in.xml for the same project I set the name attribute of one of my view extensions to %view.label.
 When I run the application the value for the view.label key ("My View") is automatically retrieved and displayed in the app.
 However, if I open the plugin.xml editor "My View" does not appear, but rather "%view.label".
Note that if I had not changed the location of the Bundle-Localization it would have defaulted to plugin.properties in the root of my project.
 In this situation the plugin.xml editor displays the key value correctly, and "My View" would appear next to the view extension.
So, whatever mechanism does the lookup is working correctly in the application, but the plugin.xml editor doesn't appear to do it's lookup based on Bundle-Localization.
