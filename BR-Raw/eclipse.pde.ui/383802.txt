Bug 383802 – Run button defaults to RAP in the "Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers" download

If I download "Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers" and press the "Start" button on the product configuration file it default to a RAP application.
I think as RAP is contributed and less used then pure Eclipse RCP application the default should be "Eclipse Application".
Maybe if the texts are adjusted this will change the order?
Launch a RAP Application -> Launch RAP Application
Launch an Eclipse Application -> Launch Eclipse Application
