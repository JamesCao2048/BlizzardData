Bug 125221 – [doc] missing context help
There are many instances in PDE (well, not just PDE) where there is no context help available - it is either just not there or we get the default parent help like for the new or import/export wizards.
This will become more apparent once the help button is added to dialogs.
Here are some examples as I was going through..
