Bug 218949 – Add "change" to setup for project nature addition
There should be a visible change in the setup for the API tooling nature addition to each project.
This way, projects with no component.xml will still show that they will have changes applied.
Ideally, the change would not be able to be disabled (but not sure that is possible).
