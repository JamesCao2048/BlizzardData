Bug 168126 – Warnings on project after importing w/ source folders a project that was exported with source
Steps to recreate:
1.
Create a Plug-in Project
2.
Export with Source
3.
Delete plug-in project
4.
Import exported plug-in with source folders
Result: There are warnings on the plugin.xml and Manifest.MF for any references to classes.
 This is because there are no source folders on the buildpath.
