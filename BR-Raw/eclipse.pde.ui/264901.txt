Bug 264901 – [target] target plaform pref page table & move operation
The new target platform preference page needs the following enhancements:
* The view of target definitions should be a table with 2 columns.
The first column should be "Name" (as shown currently), and the second column should be the "Location".
Definitions stored in the workspace will show their workspace path in this column.
Definitions stored with metadata will leave this column blank.
* The table should allow sorting on either column (by pressing the column header).
Sort order should be persisted (as a preference, perhaps), so that the order is consistent when the page is later re-opened.
* An image overlay should be used for definitions stored in the workspace - to visually distinguish them.
There is a project overlay available (ask Curtis for this...)
* A "Move..." action shold be added to the buttons on the right that enables when a metadata definition is selected, allowing the definition to be moved to the workspace.
A dialog should open to allow the user to specify a file location for the definition in the workspace (there should be a standard dialog for this).
Note that the preference page displays in memory copies of all workspace target definitions.
This allows all operations on the page to be canceled.
In this spirit, moving a target definition to the workspace is also cancelable (this is just copying a meta target def to ws target def that have different handles - the ITargetPlatformService provdies a copy method).
