Bug 155102 – Use ctrl+shift+G to find references of Extension points
ctrl+shift+G is a java short cut to find references to a java object.
 Currently, to find other references to an extension point, you have to click "find declaring extension point", then switch to the extension points tab, and click "Find references".
It would be handy if I could find other references by using ctrl+shift+g, or even right click on an extension point to find other references.
I figured this might be up your alley Chris, under sexiness.
