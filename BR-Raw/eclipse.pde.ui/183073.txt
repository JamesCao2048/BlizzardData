Bug 183073 – [Manifest][Editors] Go Home/Back/Into are not necessary
In the context menu of the Extensios section of the manifest editor, we have a Go Home/Back/Into triple menu contribution.
 This drilling is not useful in this context and becomes particularly confusing when you have drilled into an extension and pressed 'Add...'
We should just remove them.
 It would also unclutter the context menu.
