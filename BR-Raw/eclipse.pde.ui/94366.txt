- Create a new RCP app using the mail template
- Create a feature F, including the plugin previously created
- In F, create a product file called foo.product.
- In the product editor, change the product configuration to use 'features'
- Move to the configuration tab of the product editor and try to "add..." a
feature, you will notice that F appears twice.
