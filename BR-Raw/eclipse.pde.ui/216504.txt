Bug 216504 – Support multiple Lazy Activation headers
In an effort to provide maximum portability, it would be nice to support multiple lazy activation headers so that way a plug-in could be lazy activated when run in 3.0 and in 3.4.
This does provide some interesting delimas.
 The form editor has a check box that sets whether a bundle is started lazily.
 This check box will be initialized based on the most current header for your target platform (or the same way the runtime in your target platform will resolve the header).
 The current algorithm is:
3.3+ : Bundle-ActivationPolicy
3.2-3.3 : Eclipse-LazyStart
3.0-3.1 : Eclipse-AutoStart
The check box will then modify ALL lazy activation headers when its state is changed (un/checked).
 This is to try to keep all the headers in sync with each other.
