Bug 305232 – [feature] [launching] When choosing features to launch, counter does not update with filtering
1) Open launch config, plugins tab, choose "Selected features below"
2) Have a subset of features checked (counter is correct)
3) Apply a text filter that changes the visible checked
Result:
Counter only considers what is checked and visible
The fix will be to use the filtered checkbox tree's getCheckedLeafCount() method.
 It was implemented specifically to get a count that ignores the filters.
