Bug 218697 – dynamic plug-in project API description and API component
As plug-ins are modified in the workspace, the associated API descriptions, components, and workspace profile need to be kept up-to-date.
Implemented a new API description for plug-in projects that dynamically retrieve API description information from the workspace, using modification timestamps to know when the data is stale.
Modified the API profile manager to dispose the workspace API profile when a manifest, build.properties, or classpath changes.
This way our OSGi state stays up to date.
A new workspacep profile is created on demand.
