Bug 79794 – Adopt new hyperlink feature
N200412010010
Hyperlink (also known as Ctrl+Click) support has been added to text viewers and
editors.
For details see text build notes.
If you now hover over an URL while MOD is pressed in the PDE editor's source
page it will show up as hyperlink and you can open it.
There are two things to do:
1) use the shared hyperlink preferences.
AFAIK the PDE source
editor already sets a chained preference store but since its source viewer
configuration inherits from SourceViewerConfiguration and not from
TextSourceViewerConfiguration you need to copy all the getHyperlink* methods
from TextSourceViewerConfiguration.
2) PDE Source editors should offer to detect other links in plugin.xml (e.g.
type names) by writing an IHyperlink and IHyperlinkDetector for each
hyperlink target and by extending
SourceViewerConfiguration.getHyperlinkDetectors(...) to return yours and
the inherited ones (currently URLHyperlinkDetector).
