Bug 61185 – [Manifest][Editors]Browse for class attribute types could restrict using basedOn class/interface
When using the extension page of the plugin editor it would be handy if the
types returned when pressing the browse button were restricted to those that
implement/extend the class specified in the basedOn filed of the attribute (if
it has one).
 This would make it harder to put in classes that would fail
runtime type checks.
