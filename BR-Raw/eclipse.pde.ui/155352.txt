Bug 155352 – Enable "Properties..." button for multiple selected Imported Packages
On the Dependencies page of the manifest editor, the Imported Packages section allows the properties of the imported packages to be configured via the Properties...
button.
Unfortunately, this button is only enabled when a single Imported Package is selected.
 It would be a usability improvement if the button was enabled for multiple selected Imported Packages.
There should be no special considerations necessary for multiple selected Imported Packages, and any changes should be applied equally to each of the selected Imported Packages.
Once multiple Imported Packages can be selected, the title of the dialog box that is opened when the Properties...
button is clicked should probably be changed to simply "Imported Package Properties", since today it is set to the selected package, which is certainly unsual.
