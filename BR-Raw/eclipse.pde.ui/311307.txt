Bug 311307 – New OSGi Console needs polish
3.6 M7.
The new OSGi Console needs polish:
- each time I choose it from the Console view menu a new one is created which is
not the case with the other view actions (they just switch or create it when
called the first time)
- the name of each such created OSGi console is the same hence I have no clue
which one is which
- if I got the N&N right then this is the dev workspace console.
This is not
obvious to the user.
It might be quite dangerous if he misleads this and starts
to mess around with its dev workspace
