Bug 129689 – Unable to add extra dependencies to an RCP project
After creating an example eclipse RCP application everything runs great.
If I add another, new, dependency, I have been using org.eclipse.ui.forms or org.hibernate.eclipse as examples (since this is when I first noticed the bugs I kept using them for testing) the application does noet start anymore.
this is my log entry:

I was using eclipse wtp all-in-one and myeclipse, tried a 3.1.2 virgin eclipse, nothing changed, tried 3.2M5a, nothing changed, I can't do a decent rcp app at the moment on this machine anymore.
I have to note that it did work until shortly, nothing major changed, only notable difference with my laptop is that it's an x64 machine with windows x64, I've google'd my *ss off but found nothing directly related to this.
