Bug 197817 – Plug-in should be removed from Java Search when imported as source
I20070724-0800
Has already been reported as fixed in bug 56501, but apparently, no regression test caught the reappearance of this problem.
- new workspace
- Plug-ins view
- Select All
- Add to Java Search
- import org.eclipse.core.expressions as source
- Navigate > Open Type, enter "AndExpression"
=> two matches for same class (from source and from External Plug-in Libraries)
