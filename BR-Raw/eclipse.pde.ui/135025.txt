Bug 135025 – improve the import plugins/fragments filter
Eclipse 3.2M6
When you try to import plugins/fragments you are provided with a filter where you can type the plugin name or wild cards like "*".
The problem is when using wildcards the plugins from the list are only selected and not filtered out.
If you have 300 plugins and you type "*ui" as the filter, you still have to scroll the list of 300 plugins in order to find the ones that match your filter.
Besides being hard to use it is inconsistent with other filters provided by PDE.
For example, when you want to add a dependency to your plugin, when you type "*ui" all plugins that do not match the filter are removed from the list.
This is the behavior I would expect from the import wizard.
