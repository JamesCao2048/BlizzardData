Bug 166546 – Exporting the default package of a plug-in project does not allow other plug-ins to use classes in the default package
Build ID: I20061102-1715
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Create new class in the default package of a plug-in.
2.Export the default package.
Using the runtime tab, Add an Exported package, and choose (default pacakge); or add '.' to the export-package list in Manifest.MF.
3.In a differnt plug-in, add the first plug-in to the required plug-in list.
4.Try to reference a class from default package of the first bundle, in the second plug-in.
More information:
Also interesting, you can add the default package to the list of exported packages (in the Runtime tab) multiple times, which you can't do for actual packages.
If you close and re-open the Manifest File, the extra packages will be removed.
