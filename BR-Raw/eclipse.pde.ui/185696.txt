Bug 185696 – [Manifest][Editors] Automated Management of Dependencies: Title disappears
Build ID: The next integration build.
In the Dependencies section of the Plug-in Editor, the Automated Management of Dependencies section occasionally does not show its title until you click on it.
This was no doubt cause by my fix for bug 185406.
Whoops!
Please assign to me.
