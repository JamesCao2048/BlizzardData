Bug 66237 – Feature Wizard / Feature Patch Wizard can be shortened
Combine Custom Install Handler page with Feature/Patch properties pages and
beautify :)  Source and Java Build (aka Output) folders should be taken from JDT
Preferences.
For Patch wizard, the properties page should have
- a group for patch properties
- a group for properties of feature being patched
- a group for custom install handler settings
For Feature wizard, the properties page should have
- a group for feature properties
- a group for custom install handler settings
