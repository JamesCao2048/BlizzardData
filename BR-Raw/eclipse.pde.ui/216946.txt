Bug 216946 – Unable to run JUnit4 tests if org.eclipse.jdt.junit4.runtime is not in target platform
Build ID: I20070621-1340
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Create a target platform that doesn't contain the org.eclipse.jdt.* or org.eclipse.pde* projects.
 (In my situation those files are not even present in the folder not just deselected from preferences)
2.
Change your eclipse preferences to point to that directory.
3.
 Create a Plugin project that has a dependency on org.junit4 and contains a JUnit4 test that just does Assert.assertTrue(true);
4.
Right click on the test class and select to run as JUnit Plug-in Test
The console will appear as if it is starting the java process for the test but then after a time it will say the process is terminated.
 The Junit view will not display any results and no workspace for the launch configuration will be created.
 The test just dies with no feedback.
More information:
In my situation my target platform will contains only those bundles necessary to run my app and its test dependencies.
 It won't contain Eclipse endstates needed for the IDE.
This issue is also similar to one resolve for when Eclipse 3.3 was released (Bug 169452).
