Bug 182215 – [Plug-in Dependencies view] Initial empty state may be confusing
When opening the awesome plug-in dependencies view, there is no plug-in acting as a focal point, so it opens empty.
This can be confusing, since the only way to populate it is via a hidden context menu item.
Suggestions:
1.
Initially populate it with the state of the state.
2.
Add a toolbar icon (showing glasses - I'm sure we have one in the database), that would invoke the Plug-in selection dialog when pressed (ie a more visible alternate to 'focus...' in the context menu).
3.
Also, would it be possible to have the menu that shows/hides resolved bundles to be part of the 'Show state' toolbar item.
 It would look nicer and tighter.
 e.g.
kind of like the drop down on the History button in the view.
