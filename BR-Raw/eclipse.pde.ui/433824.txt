Bug 433824 – API scan filter should mention what was filtered from report
When using the API scan with filtering from an Ant script,
e.g.
<apitooling.apiuse
location="${test.build}"
scopepattern="${scope.pattern}"
referencepattern="${ref.pattern}"
report="${xml}"
considerapi="false"
considerinternal="true"
considerillegaluse="true"
excludelist="${exclude}"
filters="${filters}"
debug="true"
/>
The resulting xml, html report does not mention if or which filters were used.
Date of the Scan: 	Apr 30, 2014, 8:09:05 AM
Description:
Includes API References: 	false
Includes Internal References: 	true
Includes Illegal Use: 	true
Baseline Location: 	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Scope Pattern: 	com\.ibm\..*
Reference Pattern: 	org\.eclipse\..*
Report Location: 	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
API Patterns: 	None
Internal Patterns: 	None
Archive Patterns: 	None
From Filter Patterns: 	None
To Filter Patterns: 	None
So it is not clear if any filters were used to affect the scan.
