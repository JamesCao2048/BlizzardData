Bug 302928 – Target Definition problems with Helios
Build Identifier: I20100129-1300
I'm having some trouble with my target definition.
After adding http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios  as "software site", I selected a few projects.
Now if I want to add new projects (double click on the "software site") the dialog tells me "At least one item must be selected" and my previous selection is gone.
Far more worse is that I can not unselect "Group by Category", well I can but nothing happens.
Same result when I create a new target definition trying to unselect the "Group by Category" option.
I would like to add "Eclipse SDK" to my selected projects which is not possible.
I just tested it with Eclipse 3.5.1 and the Helios Update Site works properly.
Reproducible: Always
