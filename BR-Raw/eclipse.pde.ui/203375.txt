Bug 203375 – User defined ant properties not passed to export process
Users do crazy things all the time.
 I talked to a user who tried to reference a bunch of jars outside of the workspace.
 The jars are included in the runtime, therefore they don't need to be bundlized.
The project built just fine in the workspace, but fail on export.
 The solution is to use build.properties tags to specify additional jars to be included during the compilation of source code.
 In order to prompt as much reusability as possible, we decided to use an Ant property to specify the location.
 There was a slight problem with this approach.
The export process queries the Ant preferences for properties.
 Unfortunately, it only queries/sets properties contributed by extension points.
 Therefore, the user cannot add custom properties in either the build.properties or really in the build.xml.
