Bug 296970 – Plug-in import detail page has bad layout in linux
On the second page of the plug-in import wizard, there are two lists separated by buttons.
 These lists are intended to be of equal size, filling extra space in the dialog.
On linux, the sizes are not equal because the first list's width is forced to be as wide as the first checkbox option underneath it.
