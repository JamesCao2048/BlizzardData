Bug 138093 – Adding an Imported Package Should Provide Default Version
Using Eclipse 3.2 RC1
When using the Imported Package section of the manifest editor it is cumbersome to have to choose a package to import, and then click Properties...
to set the version.
 It would be nicer if when you click the Add...
button and choose a package the version is automatically set to that of the chosen package.
 If you wish to specify a different version then you'll have to use the Properties...
button, but this should be rare.
Additionally, when you click the Properties...
button it would be nice if the Minimum Version field was automatically populated with the version of the visible package.
 Again, this will be the most common use case.
