Bug 101524 – Support for extension refactoring for extension point ids
I was dividing a test plugin I have into separate plugins.
I used the Java
Move refactoring to move a bucnh of classes.
It would be nice if a similar
option existed for moving the extensions defined in the plugin manifest.
Here
are a couple of possibilities to think about:
1) PDE registeres a Java Move participant that will move any extensions that
reference any of the classes being moved.
This is the deluxe solution.
2) The plugin manifest editor provides a Move command that can move one or
more selected extensions to another plugin.
In both cases, you would want to be able to move a subset of the children of
any given extension definition.
