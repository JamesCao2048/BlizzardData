Bug 321891 – Missing import-package quick fix
Created attachment 175951 [details]
Project showing missing quick fix
PDE has lots of validation errors and quick fixes.
When a problem is due to missing dependencies in the manifest and PDE knows which bundle the missing package is from, there are usually two (or more) quick fixes:
- add an import-package (listed first, as per the best practise)
- add a require-bundle
Unfortunately, we've found one case where the first quick-fix is missing.
This has caused some of our testers to chose the require-bundle option, which caused problems later on (import-package was a better option, and works more often in our runtime).
I've attached a project that shows this issue.
It is a bit contrived, but I was trying to simplify a more complex testcase.
I think I've determined that this issue only appears when the missing dependency is a package from a bundle you are already importing a different package from (i.e.
the bundle is already in the PDE classpath container).
To see the issue, open BrokenClass.java and look at the compile errors on lines 3 and 8.
The quick fix for line 3 has both options, but the quick fix for line 8 only shows require-bundle.
