Bug 183260 – State out of sync after switching targets
build i0418-1012
- download and extract the RCP delta pack
- download and start Eclipse SDK on an empty workspace
- check out org.eclipse.pde.build and org.eclipse.update.core from HEAD
- change the target platform to be the RCP delta pack
- note the errors from missing plug-ins, this is ok
- switch the target back to the original (reset button)
- note that the errors still exist
