Bug 151501 – Vertical layout is weird on Extensions page
The Extensions/Extension Points pages of the plug-in manifest editor have toolbar buttons on the top right of the page that toggle the orientation (horizontal/vertical).
The vertical orientation looks weird, particularly on the Extensions page that also has a Body Text section.
I suggest removing these two buttons, as the horizontal orientation is the only desirable setting.
