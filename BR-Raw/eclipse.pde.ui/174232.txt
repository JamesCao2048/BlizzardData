Bug 174232 – macosx/Info.plist is out of date
The copy of Info.plist in org.eclipse.pde.core/macosx is not the same as the one shipped for eclipse itself.
 See org.eclipse.equinox.executable/bin/carbon/macosx/*/Eclipse.app/Contents/Info.plist
Note that any -vmargs in the plist file will cause the vmargs in the eclipse.ini file to be ignored.
 The vmargs here should be placed in the eclipse.ini instead.
 (As a side note, see bug 173572 about whether or not we still want the -Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.noFocusRing)
The -startup ../../../startup.jar can be removed completely since
(1) startup.jar has moved to the plugins directory and is org.eclipse.equinox.launcher, and
(2) the new launcher accounts for the difference in directories on the mac (the ../../..)
