Bug 56371 – Registry View does not show all activated plugins
Open the plug-in registry viewer and notice activated plug-ins such as o.e.swt
are NOT in the list.
 Go to the toolbar, drop-down menu, uncheck 'Show Active
Plug-ins Only'.
 Click on o.e.swt and notice that it actually has been activated
but the viewer never illustrated this fact.
Scrolling down the viewer, I noticed other plug-ins become activated as they're
selected (i.e.
jdt.source, jdt, jdt.doc.isv, pde.source, etc.)
Investigate why certain activated plug-ins aren't identified as being activated.
