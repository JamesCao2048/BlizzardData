Bug 179345 – import plugin dialog: unable to cancel operation
Build id: I20070323-1616
Steps to reproduce: start RAD and import all RAD plugins
the wizard opens, select Project with source folders
click next: I suspect the importable resources are being parsed / scanned
Note that the wizard has not Cancel button enabled.
I would like to Cancel my import and click on the top right red cross to close the import dialog.
--> in the to be attached screen shot, please note that there is nothing I can do to Cancel this import, but wait for the background operation to complete.
