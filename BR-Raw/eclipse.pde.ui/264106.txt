Bug 264106 – [target] Provide careful handling when the "Remove" button is pressed
Using Eclipse 3.5 M5.
The "Target Platform (experimental)" preference page gathers all the targets that exist in the .metadata and the workspace.
Unfortunately, the UI does not always show where the targets reside, and clicking the "Remove" button physically deletes the files, rather than just removing it from the list of managed targets.
 The downside of this is that a file from the workspace can be lost without the user realizing it.
Some suggestions:
1.
Show in the UI where the target file resides:
- For those that reside in the .metadata you could just say something like
"Private" or "Internal", or some such word.
- For those that reside in the workspace, the workspace's relative path would
suffice.
- And if/when in the future targets can reside in the local file system, but
outside of the workspace, the absolute path should be shown.
2.
Creating a target is not necessarily trivial, so please consider adding a
confirmation dialog to the "Remove" behavior.
- This will help prevent accidental deletion, somewhat.
- To delete a target that resides in either the workspace or the local
file system the dialog should contain a checkbox that the user is
required to check before the .target file is really deleted.
 This is
just like when you delete a Project from the workspace.
- You could add a "Don't ask me again" checkbox for those that find it
annoying.
Although I'm not convinced that this is a good thing.
