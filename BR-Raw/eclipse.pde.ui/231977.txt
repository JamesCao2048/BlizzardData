Bug 231977 – copying multiple extensions triggers java.lang.ClassCastException
Build ID: 3.4m7
Steps To Reproduce:
if you view the plugin manifest and click on the extensions tab, and then select multiple items and copy them (ctrl+c), clicking any extensions after that results in:
java.lang.ClassCastException
An error has occurred.
See error log for more details.
[Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to [Lorg.eclipse.pde.core.plugin.IPluginElement;
More information:
copying & pasting one extension at a time seems to work OK
ive seen this with every plugin ive happened to test, but specifically i tested with org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.gnu.ui and select all the GCC children of the org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.buildDefinitions tree and copy those
