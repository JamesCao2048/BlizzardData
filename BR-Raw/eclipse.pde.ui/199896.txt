Bug 199896 – [Import][Wizard] The layout of the express page is wasteful
Created attachment 76054 [details]
patch
- Open the "Import Plug-ins and Fragments" wizard.
- On the first page, select "Import plug-ins and fragments required by existing workspace plug-ins" and click next.
There is a big open area in the middle below the only two buttons.
The buttons should be moved below to avoid wasting space.
