Bug 258129 – manipulator.loadConfiguration(...) can return empty array
Build: I20081208-1800
1) Install the build into C:\Program Files\eclipse
2) Startup
3) Open the target platform preference page
-> There are no plugins listed.
It is not correctly finding the user-local bundles.info, which is under the user's home directory because this is a shared install.
Should have the same behaviour on Linux/Mac when the install directory is read-only.
