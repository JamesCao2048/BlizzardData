Bug 220069 – 'Plug-ins' view has a "malformed" content description
Build id: I20080212-0800
1.
Make sure all instances of the 'Plug-ins' view is closed across all perspectives.
2.
Open the 'Plug-ins' view.
3.
See a weird content description for the view like 'Plug-ins: org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.views.PluginsView$22@57479d'.
Needless to say, that's a toString() call on some anonymous inner class.
The root cause is line 203 of the PluginsView class...
fTreeViewer.setInput(fRoot = getDeferredTreeRoot());
...which sets an IDeferredWorkbenchAdapter implementation as the input.
The label provider being used for the tree viewer does not support this per lines 778 - 780...
String name = ((LabelProvider) fTreeViewer.getLabelProvider()).getText(newInput);
setContentDescription(viewName + ": " + name); //$NON-NLS-1$
setTitleToolTip(getInputPath(newInput));
...name, in this case, becomes org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.views.PluginsView$22@57479d.
This is likely caused by the "lazy loading" change that was added to make the view to populate itself in a background job.
