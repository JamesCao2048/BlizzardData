Bug 50018 – update class path should prompt to save the plugin.xml
If you edit build.xml and then do update class path you are not prompted to
save the build.xml file.
This can make things very confusing (and anything
which improves the comprehension of plugin classpath juggling is a good thing)
Ideally this classpath update should happen automatically
