Bug 109440 – Improvements to "Convert to plugin project..."
I just finished converting relatively large codebase to plugin projects and
decided to share my experience and extensions to PDE I've made to make this job
easier
Our code used quite a few thirdparty labraries like log4j or jdom.
New plugin
from existing JAR is a nice wizard, but I found it annoying to look for JAR
files on filesystem when I can see the JARs right in the Package Explorer view.
I've added to action to invoke the wizard by right-clicking on one or several
jar files from Package Explorer, Navigator or any other view.
Another annoyance with New plugin from existing JAR wizard is that after
importing say log4j.jar I had to manually update all projects that reference the
jar and replace JAR-file reference with project reference.
Really tedious.
I've
extented New plugin from existing JAR wizard with an option to do that
automatically.
After importing all my jars and converting all my projects to plugins, I've
found that I had to manually add plugin dependencies even though this
information was already available in .classpath files.
Really, really tedious.
To address this, I've introduced new "Update plugin dependencies..." action.
After implementing these little enhancements, overall conversion was rather
simple and quick job -- 1) created new plugins from jars which also established
dependencies on the new plugins 2) converted projects to plugins 3) updated
plugin dependencies 4) updated project classpath
