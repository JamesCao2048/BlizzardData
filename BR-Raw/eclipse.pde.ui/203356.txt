Bug 203356 – target platform looses all all previous bundles when adding a new directory of target plugins
I20070911-0833
This was so strange I had to get Chris A.
to come over and see this happen in my workspace to make sure I was not loosing it.
 Steps to reproduce:
1) Launch a new workspace and create a few plugin projects, or open a workspace with existing bundle projects if you are brave :-)
2) Create a test bundles directory somewhere (in my case c:\dev\testbundles\)
3) Export one of the plugins from your workspace into the test bundles directory, or place another built test bundle into the testbundles directory
4) In Target Platform preferences, click the "Add" button to add the test bundles directory as new provisioner.
5) Before clicking Apply or OK check the Group plug-ins by location box.
 Notice the the old locations have every bundle checked but the toplevel box for the old locations are not checked
6) Click OK, notice that the bundles resolved against the bundles in the target no longer resolve.
 It appears all the bundles from the old locations got removed from the target State which causes the workspace bundles to be unresolved.
Reloading the target seems to remove the extra testbundles location, then adding it back seems to work.
 Then if you restart you will notice that the old target bundles seem to be missing again.
More information, I configured an extension location to my dev environment, this location is also included in the list of locations in the PDE target platform.
