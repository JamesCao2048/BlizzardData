Bug 96384 – Runtime LIbrary should be classpath
In the New Plugin wizard there is a field asking for a "Runtime Library".
 This
is somewhat confusing as what people are really entireing is the plugin's local
classpath.
 Runtime Library lined up nicely with the plugin.xml markup but
classpath lines up with the manifest.mf markup and is pretty reasonable when
viewed from the old world as well.
Suggest changing this to "Classpath"
