Bug 172374 – Launch As Eclipse Application clears target workspace BEFORE it determines if it is in use
Build ID: 3.2.1 Build id: M20060921-0945
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Run ...
menu to invoke the launch configuration dialog
2.
select a workspace that is in use by another Eclipse
3.
select clear workspace
4.
RUN
5.
You will see an error message "Workspace Cannot be Locked"
6.
close the message (click OK)
7.
switch to the Eclipse instance that has (had) the workspace open
8.
refresh current view
9.
you get an error "Project location has been deleted" asking if the project should be deleted from the workspace.
More information:
I have discovered an interesting feature of platform launch.
 For my case, I
am writing JUnit plug-in tests.
 Hence, when I run the tests, a new
workbench is launched.
 Running the test causes a new Java project to be
created in the launched workspace, and project source to be generated and
compiled.
It is possible that some of my tests fail due to compile erros.
In this case, I launch a new instance of Eclipse on the launch workspace so
I can open the generated project and examine the compile errors.
Now here comes the rub.
If I forget to close this second instance of Eclipse, then return to the
primary workbench and launch another test, *and* I specify to delete the
workbench, the workbench is cleared even though another instance of Eclipse
has it open.
 *after* clearing the workbench, the launch code determines
that the workspace is locked by another instance and the launch fails.
Ultimately, the second instance of Eclipse that has the workspace open gets
errors trying to refresh a workbench that no longer exists.
It seems to me that the launch should check for the workspace being in use
*before* it does the clear.
