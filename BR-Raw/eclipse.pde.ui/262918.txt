Bug 262918 – org..eclipse.core.runtime is not always set with auto-start = true
Using I20090129-0100, I have a case where on the first start the Eclipse application launching configuration doesn't work because the runtime bundle is not set with auto-start = true.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Use an existing eclipse application launching configuration
2) Go to the Plug-ins tab
3) Select the option: plug-ins selected below only
4) Uncheck all bundles from workspace and the target platform
5) Select only one or two bundles from the workspace set of plug-ins
6) Click on "Add Required Plug-ins"
7) Validate that no plug-ins are missing
8) Run it.
9) It will fail because org.eclipse.core.runtime auto-start is set to default and default is false.
10) Go back to the launching configuration page and click Apply
11) Now it works and you can see that org.eclipse.core.runtime auto-start is set to true.
I consider this as a regression compare to 3.5M4.
