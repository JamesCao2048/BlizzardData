Bug 213457 – erroneous extension validation and content assist
Created attachment 85564 [details]
plugin project to show the bug
Build ID: e3311
Steps To Reproduce:
import attached test plugin project.
open plugin.xml.
you will see a warning on "elementB" tag, but the tag is correct defined as a child of tag b -> or.
when trying to add another tag elementB with the content assist (context menu new on the "or" tag within the extensions tab), only elementA is shown wich is wrong!
after adding a tag b and a subtag or, the minimum of 2 elementB tags are correctly added.
elementA, which is not correct within b->or seems to be correct in plugin.xml, but it isn't.
the html docu of the extension point "test" is correct.
More information:
it must be possible to define multiple tags within an extension point, having the same name, but depending on their parent, they should have the possibility to have different childs.
the extension point schema allowes this, but the extension varification and the content assist fo rnew extension point erroneous doesn't!
