Bug 164438 – Signed features mistaken for plug-ins
Build: N-20061113
When you import features from the Target platform via the Feature Import wizard, the imported features do not recognized by PDE as features in the workspace.
Upon investigation, it turns out that this is due to the fact that the imported features are signed.
The META-INF/MANIFEST.MF folder in the imported feature causes confusion between the feature project structure and the plug-in project structure.
PDE is treating signed feature projects as plug-in projects.
