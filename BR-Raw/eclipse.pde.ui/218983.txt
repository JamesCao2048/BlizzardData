Bug 218983 – Save cycle causes out of sync resources
currently for persisting api filters, we are using a java.io.File to do saving.
This has the net effect of causing out of sync errors in the workspace as no notification is sent to indicate that the underlying file has been changed.
We should be using IFile and IFile.setContents(..)
