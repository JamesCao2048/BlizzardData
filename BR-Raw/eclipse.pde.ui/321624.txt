Bug 321624 – Pgm & Vm Arguments get duplicated when launching from product editor
I20100802-1800
Steps:
* Create an RCP application project named "a.prod" based on the "Hello RCP" Template
* After the project is created, launch the project by pressing the "run" button in the project's manifest editor.
This creates a launch configuration named "a.prod.application", and on Windows has Pgm & Vm args as follows:
-os ${target.os} -ws ${target.ws} -arch ${target.arch} -nl ${target.nl} -consoleLog
-Xms40m -Xmx384m
* Create a new Product Configuration in project "a.prod", named "def.prod".
Initialize the content from the "a.prod.application" launch configuration.
The product's "Launching" tab is correctly initialized with Pgm and VM args as follows:
-consoleLog
-Xms40m -Xmx384m
* Launch the product by pressing the "Run" button in the product editor.
The resulting launch configuration named "def.product" has Pgm and VM args as follows:
-os ${target.os} -ws ${target.ws} -arch ${target.arch} -nl ${target.nl} -consoleLog -consoleLog
-Xms40m -Xmx384m -Xms40m -Xmx384m
* The consoleLog and memory arguments are duplicated
