Bug 233699 – Add support for version types other than OSGi
One of the core facilities listed for p2 is Generic Metadata, rich enough to describe units that are not OSGi or Eclipse related.
The current p2 API's uses the OSGi Version as the only possible version type.
In order to capture all types of versions, the semantics used for parsing, serializing, and comparing versions must be extendable.
I therefore suggest that the p2 API's are enhanced to recognize an opaque version with an associated type.
Here is what I think is needed:
- Two new interfaces, IVersionType and IVersion.
- The IVersion interface extends Comparable<IVersion>
- An extension point for implementors of the IVersionType.
- Implementations of IVersionType that covers OSGi and a few other very common types.
Some rules that I think must apply:
- A version type can answer if it is comparable to another type.
- A version range is typed.
Only comparable versions can be within range.
- Equality comparisons of non-comparable types yields a false result.
- Magnitude comparisons of non-comparable types is an illegal operation.
- Whenever a version or version range is serialized/parsed, it's type must also be serialized/parsed.
In most places where p2 is used in Eclipse, the version type should automatically default to OSGi.
This would of course also be true for all current repositories where no version type exists.
I would like to help out with the implementation of this if possible.
I have written similar functionality for Buckminster.
