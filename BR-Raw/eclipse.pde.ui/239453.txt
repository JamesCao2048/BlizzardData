Bug 239453 – Possible NPEs when accessing filtered text if filtered text preference turned off
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #239446 +++
There are several places in PDE where we grab the filter text to set focus the same way as debug does in bug 239446.
 If the preference is changed to turn off filtered texts, the method to get the text is spec'd to return null.
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
I had a plug-in which had the following code:
PlatformUI.getPreferenceStore().setValue(IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants.SHOW_FILTERED_TEXTS, false);
After this code ran in my IDE, the Eclipse Launcher dialog would not come up.
 Instead, it would fail with the following exception stack trace.
Now, admittedly, a plug-in shouldn't be setting this global store manually.
 But, OTOH, if this setting is false, the Launcher shouldn't be failing in the way it is.
