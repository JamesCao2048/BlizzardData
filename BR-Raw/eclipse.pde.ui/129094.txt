Bug 129094 – Polish: Remove/Remove All should not be always enabled.
In the Product editor,
On the Plug-ins tab and the Features tab, the remove button should be enabled only when there is at least one item selected in the table.
The Remove All button should only be enabled when the table contains >= 1 item(s).
Right now, these two buttons are always enabled.
