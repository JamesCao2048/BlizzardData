Bug 310036 – Polish feature based launching
There a definite improvements that we can make to feature based launching for 3.6.
 The enhancement should also be tested more thoroughly with a broader variety of launching scenarios.
One possible problem is that we set the start levels of all plug-ins to default:default.
 This should be overridden by the launcher defaults, but we have to check that this happens correctly for both Eclipse launch configs and OSGi launch configs.
Other Issues:
- Mnemonics are required for the new buttons
- The problem with using a single selection listener is that you can't reuse the methods if there are two ways to access the same funciton, case in point: The SWT.DEL key listener and remove plug-in buttons have duplicated code that is not identical.
- Tree should be expanded by default
- The remove button enablement is flaky
- Rather than removing things from input and the tree, we should either remove from the backing input and refresh the tree, or just remove from the tree.
- The add plug-ins dialog should filter plug-ins already in the config.
- Sorting seems a little off, my com.ibm feature came after org.eclipse features
