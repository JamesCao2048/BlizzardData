Bug 226788 – PDEModelUtility does not cache correctly
PDEModelUtility has a cache it uses to track which editors are currently open.
 This cache is implemented with the key being a project and the value is a list of the open editors.
When an editor opens, it calls connect.
 When it is closed, it calls disconnect.
 Unfortunately, if the editor is closing as a result of a project being deleted PDE does not correctly remove the editor from its cache.
 Instead, when it tries to get the project from the editor it returns null (as all its inputContexts have been removed) and we ignore it.
The solution is to try to do more searching in this case.
 To use the input if it is a FileEditorInput to find the project and thereby be able to remove it.
