Bug 394260 – Feature Manifest and several other editors don't respect end-line delimiters
After the line ending problems discussions[1], we, at Eclipse MDT/OCL project, decided to standarize the use of the Unix line ending.
However, windows users (like me) are having problems when using the Feature Manifest editor:
If I change a feature.xml which has Unix line endings by the means of that editor, the line endings are automatically changed to Windows one after every saving.
This is quite inconvenient, since a I have to remember to reset the Unix line ending (File -> Conver Line Delimiters To -> Unix) before every commit which includes a feature.xml file
This problem, of course, is extensible to every end-user (including other project committers) which use a Windows SO.
note: The Plugin Manifest Editor works fine what respects to this issue.
