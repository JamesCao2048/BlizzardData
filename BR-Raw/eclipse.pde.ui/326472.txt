...
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
delete a plug-in that is referenced from an existing target definition file
2.
upon opening that target definition, there is a notice that a "required plug-in could not be found"; deselect that plug-in in the "Content" tab and save

re-open the target definition; the missing plug-in is selected again!
