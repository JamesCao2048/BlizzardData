Bug 153195 – Create OSGI Bundle Manifest generates exports for CVS metadata
The create osgi bundle manifest link on the manifest editor overview page modifies plugin.xml and generates a manifest.mf file.
The Export-Package entry of the generated manifest contains entries for the root folder, and for all of the CVS meta-data folders.
 These extra exports should not be generated because they are in fact *not* packages, and cause errors to be flagged in the mainfest when the project is built.
Ex.
Export-Package: .,
CVS,
cgenrcp,
cgenrcp.CVS,
cgenrcp.actions,
cgenrcp.actions.CVS,
cgenrcp.dnd,
cgenrcp.editors,
cgenrcp.editors.CVS,
