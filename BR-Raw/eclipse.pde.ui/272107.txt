Bug 272107 – [target] Minor UI issues with new content tab
See bug 270626.
- The content tree and filter text are not flat on WinXP.
- The x of y label at the bottom of the tab doesn't show up on WinXP
- Editing the bundle containers on the location tab may break the content tab (the containers are no longer equal after they have been edited).
