Bug 180960 – Project import does not check if there is a project available on the filesystem
I20070327-0800
When importing a project from the target platform with source, the wizard does not check for the presence of a folder on the file system and overlays the source over what was there, leaving the system in a weird state.
Steps to reproduce:
- load org.eclipse.pde.ui from CVS
- delete the project from the workspace but do *not* delete it from the file system
- import org.eclipse.pde.ui using the plug-in import wiazard and check to import with source.
Once the import is complete you will notice that you still have the CVS information, which is a sign that what was there has not been deleted.
Mike told me that he had some code implementing the logic of checking, etc.
You may want to reuse that.
