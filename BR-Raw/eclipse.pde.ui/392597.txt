Bug 392597 – Create Ant Build file action fails silently on projects
1) Right click on a PDE Project
2) Plugin Tools > Create Ant Build File
Result:
Nothing happens
The problem is that BaseBuildAction checks if a manifest file is selected and short circuits if a folder/project is selected.
 The action used to be only available on certain files but with the move to commands it is available on the project as well.
