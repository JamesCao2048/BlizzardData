Created attachment 134189 [details]
Assertion failure
Build ID: I20090430-2300
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create new target defn
2.
Add something from the Galileo repo, resolve began running in the background
3.
While resolving, I gave up and closed the editor (experienced bug 274694)
4.
Resolve was still running so I clicked cancel in the progress view.
5.
Got an error dialog: "assertion failed: ContentViewer must have a content provider when input is set".
See attached.
No stack in the log.
