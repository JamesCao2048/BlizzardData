Bug 125648 – Generate imports when creating a new project from a jar
The new plugin poject from existing archive wizard is cool.
 However it does not do the code analysis to discover what the resultant plugin needs to import.
This is a severe handicap.
 I recently tried to bundlize several libs from Apache Commons.
  This is a notoriously incestuous community where everyone uses each other's libs.
 Both discovering exactly which libs are needed and what packages from those libs has proven to be extremely hard.
We should have the code around that does the batch analysis of some code to discover what imports are needed.
 Is it reasonable to hook it into this workflow?
