Bug 170474 – Dependancies not initially set in project creation wizard
build i0109-1805
When I create a new HelloWorld plug-in project with the wizard and do not choose to have an Activator class created for me, the plug-in dependancies for the project are not set up and I end up with compile errors in my java file.
Steps:
- File -> New -> PDE -> Plug-in Project
- Enter a project name
- Next
- De-select "Generate an Activator class"
- Next
- Choose "Hello, World"
- Finish
Note the compile errors in the java file.
