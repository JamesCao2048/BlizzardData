Bug 113870 – PDE editor seems to improperly process extension points defined in fragments
I have troubles with my fragment, I define a extension-point and I'm trying to
use it on the same fragment but I get an error.
The definition on the fragment.xml:
<extension-point id="test" name="My test" schema="schema/test.exsd"/>
The reference on the fragment.xml:
<extension
point="org.adexso.generator.test">
</extension>
The error:
Unknown extension point: 'org.adexso.generator.test'.
Thanks in advance
