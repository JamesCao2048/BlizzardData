Bug 251970 – [ds tooling] "Hello OSGi Declarative Services" template generates invalid MANIFEST.MF
Build-ID: N20081020-2000
Manifest generated from "Hello OSGi Declarative Services" contains following header:
Import-Package: org.eclipse.osgi.framework.console;version="1.0.0";version="0.0.0",
org.osgi.framework;version="1.3.0";version="0.0.0"
Whereas it should be:
Import-Package: org.eclipse.osgi.framework.console;version="1.0.0",
org.osgi.framework;version="1.3.0"
Note two problems here:
1.
excesive 'version="1.0.0"' string for every imported package
-> as a result dependencies are unresolved (errors in code)
2.
missing white space at the beginning of header second line
-> as a result Manifest has error "':' is required after the header name"
