Bug 206610 – Cannot build fresh workspace with I20071016
3.4
I20071016
When I load all of platform-ui and platform-ui-tests into a fresh workspace none of the dependencies are resolved and as a result I get almost 90,000 errors.
If I take an existing workspace I don't have this problem.
STEPS
1) Start I20071016 with a fresh workspace
2) Load platform-ui and platform-ui-tests
3) 90,000 errors
4) Go to a I20071010 build and create a new workspace
5)  Load platform-ui and platform-ui-tests
6) Shutdown and then re-open the I20071016 build with the workspace
7) No errors
