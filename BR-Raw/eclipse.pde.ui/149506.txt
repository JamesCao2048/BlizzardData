Bug 149506 – Code folding needs a little nudge
Build: any 3.3 build will do.
1.
Create an extension on the Extensions page of the plug-in manifest editor.
2.
Flip to the source page.
Note how the newly generated markup does not have folding associated with it.
Enter a space or something on the source page.
 Code folding appears.
