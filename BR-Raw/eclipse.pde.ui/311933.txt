Bug 311933 – Validate on feature based launch config does not consider application plug-in as requirement
1) Create a new Eclipse launch config
2) Go to plug-ins tab, change to features selected below
3) Deselect all
4) Check a random sdk feature such as org.eclipse.pde
5) Hit validate plug-ins
Result:
org.eclipse.sdk.ide is missing
The launch won't work either.
 We should have code similar to the PluginBlock which checks the application and gets the required plug-in providing it.
 This should happen on validate and launch time.
Since the code will be duplicated, it should be moved to a helper class or somewhere.
 Otherwise fixes like bug 309860 won't fix everything everywhere.
Select required doesn't help at all since it only selects required features, it doesn't account for the launcher.
 I'm not sure if changing this is a good idea.
