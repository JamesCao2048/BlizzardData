Bug 297115 – some error messages don't recognize directories
Using an M4ish build (12/04 currently) I see "error messages" for many of our build.property files ...
such as including build.properties in 'src' build.
Very cool.
Helps us clean things up.
But, there's a few that I think are overly strict on the exact form of directory name.
In one, for example, we had
source..
= beaninfo
output..
= bin
and got an error message that 'beaninfo' was not a source folder and that 'bin' was not an output folder.
But they were! Turns out, I can make the error message go away by changing them to
source..
= beaninfo/
output..
= bin/
But seems to me the trailing slash should not be required.
Very counter intuitive.
A similar case is
output..=.
Gives an error message of "the folder '.' does not exist in the workspace".
But, as a directory '.' pretty much always exists.
And in this case, adding a trailing slash did not help.
This is actually required for many "third party" (binary only) bundles that have the class files in the root of the bundle.
