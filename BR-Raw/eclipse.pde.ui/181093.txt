Bug 181093 – [Plug-in Dependencies View] Show/Hide Fragments and their dependencies
Right now, the view does not show me fragments.
So if I depend on SWT, I don't see swt.win32 in the view.
Sometimes dependencies are brought in via fragments.
 For example, org.eclipse.ui.workbench.compatibility brings in core.resources.
 So it would be good to show fragments and what they bring to the party.
We could have an option in a pull-down menu to show/hide fragments.
P.S.
 The new implementation of the view is awesome.
