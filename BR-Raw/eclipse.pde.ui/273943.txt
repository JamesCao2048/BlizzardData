Bug 273943 – Usage of pools inside api baseline xml files is causing problems
Using pools is causing grief on api baseline restore.
The pools are assumed to be used by concatenating the bundle version with the bundle name in order to read an api component from the pool's location.
This assumption is not expected when initializing the baseline on a folder location.
