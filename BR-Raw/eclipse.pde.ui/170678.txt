Bug 170678 – Dependency Management does not take into account packages in binary jars
Dependency management does not always take into account the packages found in binary jars already on the bundle's Bundle-ClassPath.
 This could cause unnecessary dependencies being added when the dependency could be satisfied by jars already in the bundle.
