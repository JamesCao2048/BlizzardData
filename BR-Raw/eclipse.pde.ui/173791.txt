Bug 173791 – PDE Tools > Organize Manifest... incorrectly identifes an externalized Bundle-Category value as unused
Using 3.3 M5
The PDE Tools > Organize Manifest...
tool incorrectly identifes an externalized Bundle-Category value as unused, and consequently removes it from the properties file.
 This is not the expected behavior.
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
 Create a Plug-in Project.
2.
 Open the project's META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.
 Add the follow OSGi headers:
Bundle-Localization: plugin
Bundle-Category: %category
3.
 If necessary, add a plugin.properties file to the root of the project.
4.
 Add the following property to the plugin.properties file:
category=Test
5.
 Select the project in the Package Explorer, and organize its manifest by
choosing PDE Tools > Organize Manifest...
from the context menu.
6.
 Check the checkbox labeled "Remove unused keys from plug-in's properties
file" and then click the "Finish" button.
7.
 Go to the plugin.properties file to find that the category propery has been
removed.
