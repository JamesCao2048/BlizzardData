Bug 169852 – Update to new JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate
20070108
In I20070109 you will find a new API class o.e.jdt.junit.launcher.JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate
which replaces JUnitBaseLaunchConfiguration (which is still there, deprecated, so nothing broken, no urgent action required)
The following patch updates PDE's delegate to use the new API.
