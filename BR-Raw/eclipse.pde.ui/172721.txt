Bug 172721 – Extension point schema editor opens as read-only from plugin.xml editor
Build ID:  I20061214-1445
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Open a plugin.xml file for a plugin which declares 1 or more extension points
2.
From the 'Extension Points' tab in the editor select the 'Open extension point schema' link.
3.
The editor opens read-only.
Is this intentional?  If so it was surprising.
 You are in an editor that is modifiable editing a resource that is associated with the contents of that editor.
