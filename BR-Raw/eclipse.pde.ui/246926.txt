Bug 246926 – [product] files should allow version selection for dependencies
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #174018 +++
PDE needs to support version information inside product files.
This may have an affect on p2/PDE Build
More information:
Now that the PDE supports multiple versions of the same plug-in, these plug-in selection lists also ought to allow you to select a specific version or versions of the plug-ins.
Instead, it seems that currently all versions of a particular plug-in are selected when you select it.
