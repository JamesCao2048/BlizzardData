Bug 201325 – [Target][Editors] Show plug-ins and features while "Include all plug-ins from the specified target" is checked
When working with the Target Editor's Content page, checking the "Include all plug-ins from the specified target" results in:
1.
 The Plug-ins tab and the Features tab shown as empty.
2.
 The Plug-ins tab and the Features tab are disabled.
This is confusing and inconsistent with other parts of the Eclipse IDE.
 Instead, I'd like to see:
1.
 The contents of the Plug-ins tab and the Features tab being disabled.
2.
 The Plug-ins tab and the Features tab remaining enabled.
As the editor works today, real content from the .target file is not displayed, which is confusing.
 For example, it is always a surprise when you uncheck the "Include all plug-ins from the specified target" checkbox to find the Plug-ins and Features tabs already populated.
A candidate for bugday, perhaps.
