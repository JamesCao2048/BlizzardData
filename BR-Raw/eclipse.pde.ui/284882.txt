Bug 284882 – [target] Make features first class citizens in target definitions
We need a grouping mechanism in targets.
 There are too many plug-ins for most users to manage.
 The standard way of grouping in Eclipse is features.
 While features are not required by p2 or osgi, they are used in a number of areas within Eclipse.
Currently features in targets are hidden from the user.
 We should make them first class citizens, incorporating them into the UI.
