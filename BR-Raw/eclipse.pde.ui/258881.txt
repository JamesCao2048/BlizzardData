Bug 258881 – Switching to new FilteredTree look causes issues on Mac
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #258236 +++
Switching to the new look causes a white background for the filtered text control.
This happens on Eclipse application launch configurations.
What is strange is that this doesn't happen to OSGi launch configurations which reuse the same filtered control.
