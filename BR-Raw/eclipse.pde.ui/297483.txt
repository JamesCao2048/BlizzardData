Bug 297483 – should warn when class file folder does not have output.<library> entry
Build.properties validation should warn when a class file folder on the build path (i.e.
library on the Java build path) does not have a corresponding output.<library> entry in the build.properties.
This is similar to a source folder not having an output entry in the build.properties.
This is a follow up to bug 297115.
