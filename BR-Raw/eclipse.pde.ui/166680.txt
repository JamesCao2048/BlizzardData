Bug 166680 – META-INF should be seen as a package name in the bundle manifest
In order to provide jsr199 support, I need to define a service which provides our implementation of the jsr199 as a possible java compiler.
In order to do that I define a file called javax.tool.JavaCompiler inside the META-INF/services folder.
This folder is located in a source folder in order to be copied to the output folder.
Inside the package explorer META-INF/services is seen as a non-java resources.
In order to make it visible to other plugins (like my test plugin), I need to add it as part of the Export-Package section of the bundle manifest.
Export-Package: org.eclipse.jdt.compiler.tool,
META-INF.services
On the line that contains it, I get an error saying that "Package 'META-INF.services' does not exist in this plug-in".
Since I need this line, I'd like it to be error-free.
To reproduce the problem, check out the project org.eclipse.jdt.compiler.tool from dev.eclipse.org.
