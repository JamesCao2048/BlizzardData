Bug 490062 – [DS] Allow to generate the lazy activation policy if OSGi DS annotations are used
After the generation of the component definition XML file, there are two warnings shown in the project.
IMHO it is bad practice that code generation creates warnings in a project.
At least if it is not intended to show a user that he has to modify something.
a) build.properties
Honestly I'm not sure if the warning is correct or if the modification of the build.properties should be modified.
It definitely forces a user to modify the build.properties manually to get rid of the warning.
I would suggest to modify the generation to create only an entry for the OSGI-INF folder in the build properties instead of the component definition XML.
So instead of something like this:
bin.includes = META-INF/,\
.,\
OSGI-INF/component.xml
it should look like this:
bin.includes = META-INF/,\
.,\
OSGI-INF/
Doing this would avoid the warning and automatically add all component definition XML files if there are multiple service implementations in that bundle.
b) MANIFEST.MF
I still don't understand why in Eclipse the DS do not work without that header.
Probably a startup order issue.
Nevertheless the OSGi wiki says "if another service is registering the components (such as Declarative Services or Blueprint) then the lazy policy may be beneficial".
So it doesn't seem to hurt.
Just as information, a DS bundle created with Bndtools does not specify the Bundle-ActivationPolicy.
Coming to the point, if a warning is raised that the Bundle-ActivationPolicy needs to be set to make a bundle that provides a DS work correctly with Equinox, we should add that header automatically.
