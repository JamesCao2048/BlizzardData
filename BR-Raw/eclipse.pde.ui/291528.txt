Bug 291528 – Synchronize project warning/error settings to build.properties
JDT added the ability in the batch compiler to specify that some warnings should instead be errors (bug 280784).
PDE/Build will add support for specifying errors in the build.properties, support already exists for warnings.
If a project has project specific settings for warning/error levels, we should synchronize these to the build.properties file.
