Bug 171473 – Remove references to Headers.parseManifest(...)
Nevermind, I figured out if I create a Dictionary (ie.
Hashtable) and pass it into the parseBundleManifest as the second argument, I can use the new function and still pass a Dictionary to the other runtime functions (without doing any contents copying).
