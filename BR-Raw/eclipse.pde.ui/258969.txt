Bug 258969 – New API Baseline dialog: Browse... should start at current install
I20081211-1908
New API Baseline dialog: The Browse...
button should start the dialog near the current install.
Currently, the chooser always opens at the root, and I have to dig down in the file system to find the install.
Chances are very high that the install I want to use is very close to the current install, i.e.
in a sibling directory.
