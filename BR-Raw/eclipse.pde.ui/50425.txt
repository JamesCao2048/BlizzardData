Bug 50425 – Plug-in Registry view does not provide useful information in the Extension Points subtree
The Plug-in Registry view contains an "Extension Points" subtree under each
plugin.
Each extension point contains a list of extensions.
However, every
element in the list of extensions looks exactly the same, making it imposible to
see any useful information beyond the number extensions.
The list must include some identifying information for each extension, or the
view is not useful.
Many heuristics could be used to generate identifiers (such
as the name of the first class or string-typed attributes in the extension's
XML, the plugin where it came from, etc.)
