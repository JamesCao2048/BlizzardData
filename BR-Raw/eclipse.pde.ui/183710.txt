Bug 183710 – [Dependency Analysis] Clean up editor section
1.
The 'Find plug-ins and fragments that reference this plug-in' should move up to second place.
 The label should be made shorter to something like 'Show dependent plug-ins'.
 Icon should be changed to the callers hierarchy icon from the dependencies view.
2.
The icon next to the first link should be changed to the callees hierarchy icon from the dependencies view
