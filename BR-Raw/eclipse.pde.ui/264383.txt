Bug 264383 – [target] First page of new target definition wizard always resets contents
1) Go to the Target platform preference page (experimental)
2) Hit Add...
3) Hit next, make some changes to the definition
4) Hit back
5) Hit next
Result:
Any changes that were made during step (3) are gone.
While changing the type to initialize the definition with should reset the contents, if nothing on the page changes we should avoid resetting all the user edited data.
