Bug 354586 – API Errors/Warnings severity fishy
N20110810-2000.
Something is fishy when determining the severity of an API Errors/Warnings problem.
1.
start new workspace
2.
set 'Missing execution environment descriptions' to 'Warning'
3.
checkout 'org.eclipse.ui.navigator' from HEAD
==> WRONG: error after build due to missing EE description
4.
open the 'API Errors/Warnings' property page for the project
==> OK: the page  indicates that the problem should be reported as warning
