Bug 154030 – Plug-in manifest editor: Switching from form to source page selects too much
I20060815-0800
Select an element on a form page in the plug-in manifest editor (e.g.
an item on the Extensions page), then switch to the corresponding source page (plugin.xml).
=> The whole source range is selected.
This makes it hard to read the actual source (see e.g.
bug 79208 comment 8).
It is also inconsistent with other selection behavior, e.g.
when I select an Extension in the Outline of the plugin.xml page, only the word "extension" of the declaring tag is selected.
Transfering a model selection into a text selection should only select the tag name.
That's also the way other editors do it (e.g.
the Java Outline: selects element name, not whole element).
