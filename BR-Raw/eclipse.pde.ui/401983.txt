Bug 401983 – [CBI] Binary plug-in import also imports /OSGI-INF from the corresponding source bundle
I20130227-2000.
Binary plug-in import also imports /OSGI-INF from the corresponding source bundle.
This is misleading, as there's already the plugin.properties file (correct).
1.
import a binary plug-in built with CBI, e.g.
jface.text
==>
imports the OSGI-INF folder
