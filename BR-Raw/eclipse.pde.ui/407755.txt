Bug 407755 – More forceful wording about adding OSGi bundle manifest in manifest editor
If you open the plugin manifest editor on a plugin with no OSGi bundle manifest, there is a section that says, "For this plug-in to take advantage of additional runtime capabilities, create an OSGi bundle manifest"
However Equinox is planning to completely remove support for plug-ins with no manifest in the Luna release (bug 407312).
For the Kepler release we should at least change this wording to be more forceful.
It currently sounds like an optional extra thing you don't have to create.
I suggest something like:
"For this plug-in to be able to run in future releases, it is highly recommended that you create an OSGI bundle manifest"
