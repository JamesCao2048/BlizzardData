Bug 221852 – Can't export features from a p2-enabled SDK
With equinox-p2-sdk-I20080305-1100-win32, it is impossible to export a feature.
Steps:
- Create a new feature project (don't even bother adding a plugin or anything)
- Export > features.
You will notice that the finish button of the wizard is never enabled.
