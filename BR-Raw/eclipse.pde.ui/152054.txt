Bug 152054 – No tooltip necessary when no description is available
When no description is available for an attribute, currently a tooltip appears when hovering over the attribute in the Extensions page of the plug-in editor.
The tooltip tells me that no description is available.
It would be better if no tooltip appeared at all.
