Bug 196866 – [Schema][Editors] Global element and local attribute identity constraints are not respected
The Schema Editor should not allow two or more (global) elements with the same name to be declared.
The Schema Editor should not allow two or more (local) attributes with the same name to be declared under the same parent.
The editor uses attribute and element names as their IDs to uniquely identify them.
 As a result, they become 'linked' and things go seriously wrong.
The auto-generated names will no longer overlap thanks to Bug # 196685
We need to guard against the user renaming the element or attribute to the same name as an existing one.
If a duplicate name is detected, I suggest reverting the entered value to the previous uncommitted value as was done for empty element and attribute names.
Note: I would consider names with the same characters but different casing to be the same (e.g.
"aB" = "Ab")
