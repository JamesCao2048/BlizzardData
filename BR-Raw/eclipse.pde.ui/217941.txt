Bug 217941 – Incorrectly parse headers in Manifest Content Assist
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Import org.eclipse.pde.core into your workspace.
2.
Go to the last time of the Export-Package header
3.
Add a comma then a new line then trigger content assist.
Result: content assist shows almost all the packages in the plug-in.
 This is because we don't parse the header correctly resulting in the Export-Package header  only containing the first 3 packages.
