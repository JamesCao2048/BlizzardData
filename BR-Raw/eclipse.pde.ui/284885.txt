Bug 284885 – [launching] manage launch configurations using features (feature based launching)
When launching an Eclipse application, if the user wants to customize what to include in the launch configuration, they must select individual plug-ins.
 This can be quite difficult due to the number of plug-ins available.
Launch configs could be managed by features.
