Bug 383001 – Typo in "Key 'mathProcessorName' is not found localization properties file"
org.eclipse.equinox.bidi has an extension that declares
<typeDescription
class="org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal.consumable.STextMath"
description="%mathProcessorName"
type="math">
</typeDescription>
...
but the %mathProcessorName is missing.
Error message:
Key 'mathProcessorName' is not found localization properties file
Correct error message:
Key 'mathProcessorName' is not found in localization properties file
It also wouldn't hurt if the path to the localization properties file was appended to the error message.
