Bug 108466 – Dups from (Eclipse)ClassLoader.getResources(String)
When running runtime workspace, EclipseClassLoader.getResources(String) returns
duplicate results for files found in plugin jarfiles (i.e.
jar files listed in
manifest.mf Bundle-ClassPath: entry or plugin.xml <library/> element).
Steps to reproduce
1.
create plugin project
2.
add a jar with "file.txt" entry to the project
3.
add the jar to plugin runtime classpath using plugin manifest editor
4.
update plugin classpath (make sure the jar got added to java build path)
5.
add code that counts number of entries returned by
getClass().getClassLoader().getResources("file.txt")
5.
start eclipse application, see that getResources returns two entries
Apparently, eclipse adds the jar on plugin's classpath twice -- as a regular
OSGi classpath entry and as a development entry.
