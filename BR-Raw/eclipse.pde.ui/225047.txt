Bug 225047 – DBCS3.4: Externalize Strings halts when using DBCS characters
Build ID: I20080305-1100
OS: Mac OS X 10.5.2 (intel)
Locale: ja_JP.UTF-8
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create a plugin project with "Hello World" template
2.
Put DBCS values for plugin name or provider in plugin.xml
otherwise, using NL packs could simplify this step since DBCS values are filled in menu and action name
3.
Select the project and start Externalize Strings wizard by PDE Tools > Externalize Strings...
4.
Make sure plugin.xml and MANIFEST.MF of the selected plugin are checked and click Finish
5.
An error dialog appears saying "An exception has been caught while processing the refactoring 'Extenalize Strings'." followed by the detailed reason as described below:
Some characters cannot be mapped using "ISO-8859-1" character encoding.
Either change the encoding or remove the characters which are not supported by the "ISO-8859-1" character encoding.
This is right, however we can generate property files from Java class including DBCS values for fields and method body by using "Externalize Strings" wizard in JDT.
Could PDE support converting DBCS values to Unicode escaped characters as JDT does before generating plugin.properties file?
