Bug 483591 – API Tools view should filter non-API changes (ApiComparator bug for generic methods)
The API Tools view should filter non-API changes.
I tried to verify the API changes for bug 478673, but the view showed too many changes for private and package-accessible members.
Those are not considered API and should not be shown.
If you still want to show non-API changes, you can add a toggleable filter.
