Bug 167313 – File System Target Provisioner wizard glitches
The File system provisioner wizard is great.
It does have a few glitches though:
1a.
Too many levels of indirection before choosing a directory.
The Add Location dialog is not necessary.
 the Add...
in the wizard should directly invoke the directory chooser.
Also, the Variables thing is a little weird here.
 I suspect you wanted to reuse the location dialog from the target editor.
 While it makes perfect sense for variables to appear in the target editor since those .target files are sharable.
 Here people just want to add directories and they are not sharing that info.
1b.
The Edit...
button should be removed when 1a is done.
2.
The Directory choooser has amnesia.
 Every time I open it, it goes back to an all-collapsed uninitialized state.
The first time it is open, we should initialize it to the current location of the target platform.
 Every subsequent time it is open, it should be initialized to the last location entered.
3.
The help button in the bottom left does nothing.
 you need to hook up context help.
4.
The wizard page description should read 'Add plug-ins from the file system to the target platform'
5.
The font in the table viewer and label does not honor the dialog font preferences.
