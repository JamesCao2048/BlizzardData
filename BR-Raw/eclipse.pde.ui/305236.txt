Bug 305236 – feature based target with 'feature locations' does not work properly
Steps:
* Create a target definition with two feature locations, managed by features:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<?pde version="3.6"?>
<target includeMode="feature" name="Copy RCP with Source">
<locations>
<location id="org.eclipse.rcp" path="${eclipse_home}" type="Feature"/>
<location id="org.eclipse.rcp.source" path="${eclipse_home}" type="Feature"/>
</locations>
</target>
It shows that all features in the installation will be added to the target, rather than just the ones from the feature locations.
I created this target definition based on the 'RCP with Source' template.
