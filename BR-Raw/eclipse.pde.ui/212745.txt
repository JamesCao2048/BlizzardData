Bug 212745 – Wording and wrong title case in dialog that warns when importing while running a target
I20071212-0010.
See bug 185502 for details.
The dialog that's now shown has three issues:
- it should be a warning dialog
- dialogs should use title casing i.e.
start words with big letters
- it says: ...
plug-ins my not be...
(my -> may)
- the message talks about 'workbench' but actually it can be anything that
runs eclipse code (e.g.
a simple SWT app).
How about this:
title:
Running Application
message:
An application is currently running.
Some of the selected plug-ins may not be imported if they are locked by it.
Do you want to continue?
If more than one app is running it has to be changed to:
title:
Running Applications
message:
Applications are currently running.
Some of the selected plug-ins may not be imported if they are locked by one of them.
Do you want to continue?
