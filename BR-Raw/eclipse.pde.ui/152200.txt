Bug 152200 – Amnesia when retrieving extension point descriptions
due to fix for bug 151702, descriptions are not stored in our schema models which is a good thing.
In the New Extension wizard, we now parse the schema every time an extension point is selected to retrieve its description.
 but then, we don't keep track of visited extension points, we reparse when an extension point is selected again.
Given that we already paid the memory penalty once upon the first parsing, it would be good if we cached descriptions until the wizard is dismissed.
