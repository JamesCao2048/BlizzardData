Bug 205198 – Flag when there are missing bundle or package version ranges
In the effort to meet one of our themes for the 3.4 release, "Keep Tom Happy," we need to investigate adding a marker to optionally flag people who forget version ranges on Import-Package/Export-Package and Require-Bundle.
It's a good OSGi practice to always include this information.
This is a good bugday exercise too.
