Bug 295577 – [target] Target args do not get added to configs created from product configurations
- On the Mac with Cocoa 32bit on Snow Leopard...
- Create a target platform
- Flip to the environment tab and set -d32 as a VM arg to cause the a launched JRE to be in 32 bit mode
- Create a product/launch config that uses SWT (so it has 32 bit libs as per the defaults for a 32bit SDK)
- Run the launch/product
- Notice that you get an error saying that you cannot run 32bit libs on a 64bit VM
- Now add -d32 to the VM args on the product/launch
- Run again and notice that everything works
Summary, -d32 on the launcher/product does the trick but the VM args (well at least that VM arg) set on the target are ignored.
Note that I don't think this is anything specific to the Mac, I just happen to have a scenario on the Mac that surfaces the problem
