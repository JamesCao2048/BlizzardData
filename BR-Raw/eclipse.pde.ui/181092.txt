Bug 181092 – [Plug-in Dependencies View] Show/Hide optional dependencies
It would be good to have an option (via a pull-down view menu) to show/hide optional dependencies.
Depending on how creative Brian feels, it may be cool to play around with SWT/JFace to have an option display optional dependencies in a different font/color.
 But that's for extra coolness credit.
P.S.
 The new implementation of the view is awesome.
