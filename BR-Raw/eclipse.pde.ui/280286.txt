Bug 280286 – Search engine should report results after a threshold has been hit
I20090611-1540
Currently our search engine reports any results it has found when it finishes searching a package.
It can happen that a package can contain many many types, which leads to our search engine running out of memory.
We should include a threshold (max reference count) that if hit would also report.
