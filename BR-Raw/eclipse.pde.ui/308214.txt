Bug 308214 – Allow bundle selection via features in OSGi launch configuration
The OSGi Framework launch configuration should also support bundle selection via features.
This simplifies the work of the developer when selecting bundles to launch if they use features to group bundles.
The features are not actually installed/provisioned into the running application - it's just a convenient way to select bundles from the development environment.
We'll need to add a drop-down on the top of the "Bundles" tab to specify how bundles are selected (with two options):
* bundles selected below
* features selected below
