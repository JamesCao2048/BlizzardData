Bug 244673 – Invalid API problems for method that changed from private to @noreference public
M20080813-0800 and I20080812-0800
- check out org.eclipse.ui.navigator from HEAD or R3_4_maintenance
- remove .api_filters file
=> Invalid error:
The method org.eclipse.ui.navigator.NavigatorActionService.getActionProviderInstance(CommonActionProviderDescriptor) is no longer API
The method used to be private in 3.4 but the fix for bug 212389 turned it into:
/**
* [..]
* @noreference This method is not intended to be referenced by clients.
*/
public CommonActionProvider getActionProviderInstance([..]
