Bug 139526 – E2.9 Extra Dependency added
3.2RC2
After preforming step E2.9 in the PDE 3.2 Scenarios an extra plugin dependency, "org.eclipse.jface", was added.
 This does not match E2.9's description which states only "org.eclipse.core.runtime" and "org.eclipse.ui" should be appear in the required plug-ins section.
