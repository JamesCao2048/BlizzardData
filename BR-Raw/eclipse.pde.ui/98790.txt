Bug 98790 – Leakage: UndoActionHandler / RedoActionHandler not disposed on open/close of plugin.xml
N20050603-0010
The UndoActionHandlers and RedoActionHandlers are leaking (and keeping other
large parts of the world with them) on the close of the manifest editor as the
part listener that should call the dispose is not "matching" on the part
closing.
When the manifest editor closes, the part listener in
OperationHistoryActionHandler (line 90) compares the part (ManifestEditor)
with the site.getPart() (BundleSourcePage).
So this always fails and the action handlers are not disposed.
