Bug 400129 – [ua] NPE when registering context help for non-plugin project
Created attachment 226651 [details]
Log with NPE
It is wrong to register context help for a non-plugin project, but the error message could be more descriptive than NPE.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Create new General Project.
2.
Create new Context Help in that project.
3.
Click "Register this context help file" in the top right corner of Context Help Editor.
4.
Click Finish.
=> Error dialog with NPE appears.
