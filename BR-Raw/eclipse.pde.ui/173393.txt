Bug 173393 – Missing Entries in Manifest generated by the Template Wizard
I am using the PDE Template Wizard framework to generate a new plug-in project.
When using 3.3M4, the generated manifest.mf file is missing a couple of entries:
*  "Bundle-Localization: plugin"  (the out-of-box PDE templates have this problem as well)
*  "Export-Package"   (my extended template section updates the plugin model with a IPluginLibrary, whose content filter used to get added to the Export-Package header)
Both of them used to get generated in prior PDE builds, including 3.3M3 and 3.2.x.
The same problem exists regardless of having specified Eclipse version 3.2 or 3.3 for the Target Platform on the Plug-in Project wizard page.
