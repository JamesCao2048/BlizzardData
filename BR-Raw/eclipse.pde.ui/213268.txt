Bug 213268 – [open plug-in artifact] filter is too stringent
3.4 M4
I am a huge fan of PDE and love the new Open Plug-in Artifact dialog, even with its flaws :)
1.
The filter in said dialog is too stringent.
 It expects you to enter the fully-qualified name for extensions and extension points for any match to occur.
This is unnecessary.
 In the Open Type dialog, you do not have to enter the fully-qualified name of a class to get a match.
 Extensions should be treated the same when it comes to their namespace requirement.
Take a look at how the extension filter works when you press Add...
on the Extensions page of the plug-in manifest editor.
2.
In the top level menu, go to Navigate > Open Plug-in Artifact.
Note how the keybinding is preceded by two weird boxes.
