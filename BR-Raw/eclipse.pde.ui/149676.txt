Bug 149676 – Plugin manifest editor - suggestion to efficiently search an extension
We have a plugin.xml that has plenty of extensions - dozens of object and viewer contributions, views, wizards etc.
As the project gets developed, certain actions are refactored to embrace new type selections.
e.g class CompareThingsAction is now able to compare an additional type and I want to change its visibility argument in the manifest editor.
It is easy to find where CompareThingsAction is used in the raw XML view (CTRL-F for CompareThingsAction).
But it is harder to find it in the Extensions tab.
Did you had thoughts on adding an input filter text to that editor? I would start typing CompareThingsAction and it would get selected in the All Extensions tree.
This is somehow related to a discussion with Nick on a global find option for any Eclipse view.
Web UI makes it easy to search for text every where, but that paradigm is lost when using plain vanilla raw widgets such as trees.
Thanks - I like the Extensions tab and much prefer setting visibility of object contributions through it rather than through a raw XML format.
Just looking for a quick way to find a particular action class :-)
