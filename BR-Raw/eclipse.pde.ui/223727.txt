Bug 223727 – Product editor should handle per platform config.ini files
As per bug 218878, we would like to add the ability to have per-platform config.ini files.
Once this support is added to the file formats in the core, we will need to be able to set these properties in the UI's product editor.
It would probably be easiest to have a mechanism to replace the whole file, rather than try and specify per-platform properties and merge the rest of the common contents.
