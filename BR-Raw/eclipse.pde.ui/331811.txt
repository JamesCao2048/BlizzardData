Bug 331811 – Polish Use Scan Feature
I had no performance issues in my tests.
 I haven't tried with an overly large (100+ project workspace) yet.
Issues:
1) I think we should revisit the pref page name.
 The current one is long (doesn't fit in the default sized dialog), not very clear and does not start with 'API' like the other API tooling pages.
 My suggestions would be:
"API Use Dependencies"
"API Dependency Scans"
"API Use Scans"
Make the API tooling pages have their own branch in the pref tree)
We originally moved away from using 'use scans' as it is not a user friendly term.
 However, only users that are familiar with use scans will ever have a use for this tool.
2) Problem category should match up exactly with the preference page name.
 We need to use a consistent name, otherwise users won't understand where the problems are coming from.
3) The problems should be associated with the type name if it can be calculated so they show up in the editor.
4) Preference page should have a link to the error level page.
5) Error levels should not be ignore by default.
 Currently the user sets up the scan on the preference page, it asks you if you want to build and you say "great, go for it".
 No errors are reported, which is perfect until you realize that there are no errors being reported period.
6) Is there any value to letting the user change the cache size?  As a user I have know idea what a reasonable value it and whether it would be beneficial for me to change it.
 No need to give the user an advanced option unless there is a definite need by some users.
7) The text at the top of the page needs a bit of work.
 It shouldn't say *the* api use scan problems.
 Second sentence should perhaps read "The dependencies found in the use scans will be compared against workspace projects to ensure they still exist."
8) Edit locations button should be removed, it adds no real value.
9) There is no help doc for the page, we should file a bug to remind us to write doc in M6.
