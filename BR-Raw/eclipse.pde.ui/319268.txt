Bug 319268 – PDE is confused about non-PDE projects
In my development workspace I have a combination of PDE and regular java projects.
Some of my non-PDE projects *happen* to have META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.
Even though the projects do not have PDE.PLUGIN_NATURE, PDE still parses META-INF/MANIFEST.MF files and considers whatever it is able to find there during resolution of dependencies of (proper) PDE projects.
These unexpected and often invalid dependencies pollute compile classpath inside workspace and, more importantly, cause runtime problems for Eclipse applications and JUnit Plug-in tests launched from the workspace.
I have rather trivial fix (check for PDE natures in org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.WorkspaceModelManager isXXXProject methods), if you are interested.
