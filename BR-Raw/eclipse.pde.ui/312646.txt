Bug 312646 – empty feature list when 1 is selected
Using HEAD:
* New Eclipse Application launch configuration
* Choose "features selected below"
* De-select all features
* check "Only show selected"
* Select "org.eclipse.pde" feature (appears in list)
* Select "plug-ins selected below only"
* Select "features selected below"
The selection count shows 1 of N, but the list/tree is empty
At this point, switching back to "plug-ins selected below" and then back to "features selected below", the selection count is now 0...
so the select gets removed somehow.
