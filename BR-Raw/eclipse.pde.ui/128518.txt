Bug 128518 – should "mark internal" default filter be *.internal*
instead of requireing trailing period, as is currently *.internal.* by default.
I know in out WTP plugins, we have a number of packages where the word 'internal'
is the last word in the package name.
(gee, hope I just didn't confess to a naming convention violation :)
e.g.
org.eclipse.wst.xml.ui.internal
I'm marking as minor, since is user settable ..
but I only knew that because I went back to look at exactly what the option was called to write up this bug report.
orgainize manifests is a cool capability, btw.
Will greatly help us clean up our manifests.
(though ...
"clean up" would be more consistent with with conceptually similar function in Java (and XML, HTML, and JSP's and CSS in WTP).
