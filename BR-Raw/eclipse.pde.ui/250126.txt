Bug 250126 – [p2] Use p2 to provision for launching, support self-hosting
Some discussion on bug 236719.
Currently when self-hosting (launching an Eclipse workbench from host) there is no p2 profile available.
 This means that p2 code that interacts with the profile (installing, updating, introspecting, etc.) does not function when self-hosting.
If PDE can provision a profile during launch, p2 self-hosting should be possible.
 It will also allow PDE to use p2 to setup config.ini/bundles.info and other files, rather than having duplicating code.
One major area of concern will be backwards compatibility.
 In PDE, users want to be able to build against and launch previous versions of Eclipse (based on the contents of the target platform).
 If we are using p2 to generate the configuration information, p2 may need to be provision in a backwards compatible way.
