Bug 175134 – "Add to Java Search" needs to be easier to find
The option "Add to Java Search" is very handy.
 So handy, one wonders why search just doesn't work this way by default.
But the option is too hidden.
 Having it squirreled away in the Plug-ins view is just too obscure vis-a-vis its utility.
 I didn't know it existed until recently, and even then I keep having to ask where it is.
Second, it works based on the set of selected plugins, but this is more precision than (most) people need.
 Why would I only want to, from here on, search in only a subset of plugins?
Suggestions:
1) Make it the default behaviour.
 People can always filter the results.
2) A variation could be that we always search plugins which loaded projects are dependent on.
3) Put it in the preferences (that's where I always think to look)
4) Add it as a menu to the jars in the packages view (that was the next place I tried).
 I like this option least for the reasons above but at least might be easier to find.
