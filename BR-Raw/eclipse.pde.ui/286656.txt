Bug 286656 – Plugins tab likes being the dirty button
I20090809-2000
Selecting the Plug-ins tab in a PDE launch configuration says the configuration has updates when none have been applied.
Steps:
1.
create a new PDE launch configuration
2.
go to plug-ins tab and change setting to "plug-ins selected below only" and hit apply
3.
close the dialog and close one of your workspace projects
4.
reopen the dialog and go to the plug-ins tab.
SHAZAAM it is marked as having changes.
Pressing the revert button does nothing, pressing apply saves the phantom changes.
