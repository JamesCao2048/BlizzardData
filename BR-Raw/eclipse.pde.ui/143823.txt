Bug 143823 – XML parser is instantiated and utilized for only one XML instance document parse and discarded
XML parsers are utilized throughout PDE to perform many tasks.
XML parsers are heavyweight items that are designed to be instantiated
and configured once and used to parse many different XML instance documents
before being discarded.
Noticed in PDE that XML parsers are instantiated and utilized for
only one XML instance document parse and discarded.
 This causes an
unnecessary degradation of performance.
One situation where this is particularly bad is during Plug-in manifest
source edits where the content is constantly being revalidated causing
new XML parsers to be constantly created and discarded.
Solution is to create a parser once for a particular task and store it
for reuse
