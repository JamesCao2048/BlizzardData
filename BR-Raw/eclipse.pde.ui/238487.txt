Bug 238487 – [logview] LogView assumes SHOW_FILTERED_TEXTS=true
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create RCP that includes the LogView plugin
2.
Run RCP and ensure the "Error Log" view can be displayed as expected
3.
Create a plugin_customization.ini for your RCP product and add "org.eclipse.ui/SHOW_FILTERED_TEXTS=false" to it
4.
Rerun the RCP and try to open the "Error Log" view again.
It should fail with a NullPointerException in LogView.showFilterText at line 461
More information:
The FilteredTree didn't create the filter control because showFilterControls was initialized to false via the setting in plugin_customization.ini.
 In many places, LogView assumes the existance of the filter control via fFilteredTree.getFilterControl() without checking that it returns non-null.
(Sorry for not including an exact stack-trace or code to reproduce the problem as it was discovered on another machine w/o internet access)
