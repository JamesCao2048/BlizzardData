Bug 65204 – XSLT web index of site.xml not supported by Mac Safari
Given that we were just getting good functionality in xsl transformations of
site.xml on new browsers, it's not surprising that some browsers haven't reached
this benchmark.
Try making an update site with generated web page.
 Open the web page in system
editor (i.e.
Safari in the case of MacOS X).
It's a blank page.
:(
I did some debugging and found that the code was failing when I was trying to
import site.xml.
 Upon researching this phenomenon, I discovered Safari simply
does not support controlled XML data importing at this point in time.

The second link has test for document loading in Safari.
 There is no workaround
but they do encourage responsive UI by indicating document.load() is not supported.
Proposed solution:  add alert for nil-support of document loading if it fails
instead of having safari hide the failure and leave the user with a blank webpage.
