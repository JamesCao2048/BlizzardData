Bug 266711 – [target] Making a target's name empty causes NPE
If you set a target's name to be an empty string in the wizard or editor you get NPEs.
 We should avoid the NPEs, but also add validation preventing an empty name (which couldn't be shown properly on the preference page).
Note that there are other fields that can be set to random values and there is no validation for them.
