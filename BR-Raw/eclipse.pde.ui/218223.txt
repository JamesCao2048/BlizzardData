Bug 218223 – PDE editor browse type causes OOME
Created attachment 89169 [details]
PDE Browse button log
BuildId: I20080207-0010
I start up eclipse in a fresh workspace, and check out org.eclipse.ui.examples.contributions.
 Bring up the Plug-ins view and add the target platform to the Java Search Path, CTRL+SHIFT+T and search for Person.
Edit the plugin.xml, go to the first handler element and add enabledWhen>with>instanceof
For the instanceof element click the Browser button and when it comes up, type Person.
On windows and linux, the CPU pegs at around 95% for anywhere from 25 seconds to 2 minutes ...
if it gets up in the 2 minute range, it usually dies with an OOME, log attached.
