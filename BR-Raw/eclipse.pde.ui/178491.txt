Bug 178491 – "Rename Bundle-SymbolicName..." is not context-sensitive
The context menu for the MANIFEST.MF source page now has a permanent "Rename Bundle-SymbolicName...".
1.
That item is in a weird place in the menu.
 It is in the Shift Left/Right section.
2.
that item must only show up where it applied, ie.
only when the value of the bundle symbolic name is selected.
 Take a look at how/when other menu items such as 'Open Type' and hyperlinking are enabled for example.
