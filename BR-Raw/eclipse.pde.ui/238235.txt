Bug 238235 – [Bundle-Localization] Default to /OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle.properties and not /plugin.properties
Due to legacy reasons I assume the default localization of bundles/plug-ins defaults to /plugin.properties.
OSGi however specifies it to default to /OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle.properties.
PDE ignores this fact.
If the Bundle-Header does not contain a localization it will not correctly resolve the texts from the OSGi default localization.
Furthermore when you want to externalize new strings it should localize them into the specified localization (which could be the default one if not specified) and not into /plugin.properties.
I think changing this behaviour would not break existing plugins and new OSGi bundle localization would be much easier to do.
