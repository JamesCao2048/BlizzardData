Bug 163707 – Support Bundle-ActivationPolicy in OSGi R4.1
See http://bundles.osgi.org/Design/LazyStart for the proposed changes that will go into the upcoming OSGi R4.1
- Why should PDE-UI care?
This proposal adds a new header "Bundle-ActivationPolicy" ...
The Bundle-ActivationPolicy header is introduced to allow a bundle to specify a bundle start policy.
Bundle-ActivationPolicy ::= policy-type (';' directive)*
policy-type ::= token
The only defined policy type is lazy.
The lazy activation policy has the following defined directives:
include â€“ A comma-separated list of package names that require the lazy activation policy.
Note that the use of a comma in the value requires it to be enclosed in double quotes.
If not specified then all packages require the lazy activation policy.
exclude â€“ A comma-separated list of package names that do not use the lazy activation policy.
Note that the use of a comma in the value requires it to be enclosed in double quotes.
If not specified then all packages require the lazy activation policy.
For example:
Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy; include:="org.lazy.stuff"
Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy; exclude:="org.notlazy.stuff"
The Bundle-ActivationPolicy header should be used instead of the Eclipse-LazyStart when a bundle is targeting a 3.3 or higher version of Eclipse.
 I suggest you keep the UI the same with the "Activate this plug-in when one of its classes is loaded" checkbox.
 If it is checked/uncheck you simply add/remove the following header
Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy
Developers that need to use the more advanced include/exclude directives will be required to edit the header by hand.
The code in Equinox has been released today to support this new header at runtime.
