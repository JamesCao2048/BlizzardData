Bug 209138 – the host plugin is presented into the Automated Management of Dependencies/Add dialog of a fragment
Build I20071029-0010
The Automated Management of Dependencies/Add dialog of a fragment opens a list of available plugins, amongst which the host of the fragment is presented.
I believe this is inappropriate (even if probably harmless).
