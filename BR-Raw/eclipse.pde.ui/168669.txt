Bug 168669 – The Load target button in the PDE preferences page for Target Platform is not enabled correctly
Build ID: 3.3M4
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Install clean 3.3M4 in Linux (In my case the distro was Kubuntu)
2.
Go to Help / Preferences / Target Platform
3.
When you select any of the already defined targets, the load target button is not enabled.
More information:
While reproducing the same steps on Windows the page works correctly.
It seems the Combo ModifyEvents are handled differently in both versions.
Adding a SelectionListener to the TargetPlatformPreferencesPage gets it to work in Linux too.
