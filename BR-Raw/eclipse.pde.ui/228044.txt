Bug 228044 – -testApplication parameter unusable if there's a product
3.4
In trying to implement this test (a SessionTest that runs an RCP application)
we discovered that the testApplication parameter (used by UITestApplication)
was effectively unusable.
 If you look at the getApplicationToRun() method
you'll see that if a product is present it will be used instead.
 Given that
testApplication is far more specific than what's considered to be the currently
active product it'd be nice if this logic could be switched.
 Ie:  put the
check for the parameter first and fall back to the product.
 Would you be
amicable to this change?
