Bug 90264 – Using nested classes in extensions leads to ClassNotFoundException
In Eclipse 3.0.1 the usage of nested Classes in an extension was done by using
the '$' seperator.
For example:
com.abc.product.core.CatalogProxy$Integer2CatalogProxyConverter (at least it's
what the plugin.xml editor produces).
In Eclipse 3.1M5 the plugin.xml editor produces this:
com.heiler.ppm.catalog.core.CatalogProxy.Integer2CatalogProxyConverter (a dot
instad of the dollar).
The nested class using the dollar synatx will not be
found by the plugin.xml editor.
Using the "dot syntax" leads to a ClassNotFoundException when trying to
instantiate the class by the extension.
