Bug 367980 – Support for pre-release versions
With changes to the Equinox VersionRange class (bug 366419) I am seeing some undesired affects to PDE UI.
 In particular the PluginVersionPart is not behaving well.
The code uses VersionRange to parse the ranges, which is good.
 But now that VersionRange supports pre-release versions we see some undesired fully qualified versions getting placed in the UI and in the manifest when they should not be.
The following table shows what unqualified version ranges get translated into when fully qualified:
[L,R) => [L-,R-)
[L,R] => [L-,R.]
(L,R) => (L.,R-)
(L,R] => (L.,R.]
These 4 variants should not be fully qualified when placed in the bundle manifest.
 This would cause the bundle to stop working on older R4.3 framework implementations since they do not understand the pre-release style versions (e.g.
1.0.0-beta) that use a '-' qualifier separator.
I will attach a patch with a suggested fix.
