Bug 216840 – Continue validating a Bundle-Activator exists for lazy start header?
See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=216271#c8
Since it seems that having a lazy start header is sometimes valid and doesn't really ever change the behavior of the plug-in, should we continue to even validate this?  Currently, this warning is not tied to any compiler preference.
 This seems like something that might not warrant us adding yet another preference to the PDE preference page.
 I wanted to make sure adding a preference and setting its default value to ignore is warranted based on this problem.
