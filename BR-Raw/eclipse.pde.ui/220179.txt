Bug 220179 – [Manifest][Editors] XMLInputContext erase more characters when removing nodes
Created attachment 90638 [details]
a patch for the problem
This happens in files where there are different line delimiters.
The org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.context.XMLInputContext.getDeleteNodeOperation(IDocumentElementNode) method tries to defend itself against line delimiters by relying on each line to keep its delimiter.
When a node is removed, the newline from the previous line is tried to be removed.
However, when checking the line delimiter length, it checks the delimiter of the start line instead of the previous, which we try to remove.
This leads to situation where more characters than needed are removed.

I'm attaching a patch to better illustrate my explanation which isn't exactly clear:)
