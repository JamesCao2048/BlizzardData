Bug 176613 – Load Target button not enabled until Pre-defined Target Platform is selected in the Combo
Build ID:  I20070222-0951
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Open the Preferences for selecting a Target Platform (Plug-in Development>Target Platform)
2.Browse for a pre-defined target.
3.Select a pre-defined target and close the File Selection Dialog.
The combo will now be populated with the pre-defined Target however the Load Target button is disabled.
 User has to make a selection in the combo before the Load Target button will be enabled.
 In previous versions of Eclipse (<3.3M5eh) the Load Target button would be enabled once the File Selection dialog was closed and a selection was made.
