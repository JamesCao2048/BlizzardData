Bug 274678 – [category] file selection dialog displays error dialogs while searching
I20090430-2300
* Export a feature
* Choose a categorization file from the options tab using the "Browse..." button
If an exception is hit checking file content types an error dialog is shown for each exception on top of the file selection dialog.
We should suppress these errors.
For example, I got several "resource out of synch with the file system" dialogs.
