Bug 130424 – New Registry view shows fragments
The old registry view did not show fragments while the new one does.
Fragments are generally not very interesting in the registry since they would have coalesced with their host, so the information would be duplicated in the host anyway.
We should either:
1.
filter them out, as we have done in the past, OR
2.
show them but with the right icon.
 Right now, they show up with a blue plugin icon
A bundle is a fragment if it contains the Constants.FRAGMENT_HOST header.
