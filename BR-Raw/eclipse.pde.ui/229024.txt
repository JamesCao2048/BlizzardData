Bug 229024 – meta attribute in schema should be case-insensitive
Looking at the org.eclipse.ui.encodings extension point, you see a tab with "?" on the overview page of the schema editor.
This is caused by an meta attribute called "apiInfo" which is not recognized by PDE.
Seems PDE only recognizes the "apiinfo" type as valid attribute for api informations.
