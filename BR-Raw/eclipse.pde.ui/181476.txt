Bug 181476 – Import existing plugin destroys custom project natures
To reproduce:
1) install any plugin with both custom project natures and exported with source
2) import plugin with source
3) check .project - custom natures will be lost
Currently org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.imports.PluginImportOperation.setProjectDescription(IProject project, IPluginModelBase model) explicitly forces the the project nature to Java and/or PDE.
However, if a developer had developed some plugins that contained custom natures, exported the plugin with source (including the original .project) - on import that information would be lost and would have to be manually reinstated.
This makes the deployment of custom plugins a significant challenge.
A simple change would be for setProjectDescription() to get the previous natures and add the Java/PDE natures (if necessary) instead of explicitly overwriting the natures.
