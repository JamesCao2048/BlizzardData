Bug 266548 – [target] Move... target button allows targets to be moved on top of each other
Move...
button was added in bug 264901.
 Since we are on a preference page we don't actually create the new files in the workspace until OK or Apply is pressed.
The move...
dialog only checks workspace files conflicts.
 So it is possible to move two target definitions to the same place.
 When this happens, one overwrites the other which is lost forever.
This is an uncommon case, but it is easily fixable.
 We just need to pass the list of 'moved' targets to the Move wizard.
 It can do an additional check to see if the path the user has chosen is already in the list and set an error message on the wizard.
