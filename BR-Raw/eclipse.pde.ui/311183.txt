Bug 311183 – additional plug-in in feature launch gets silently removed
I20100429-1549
* Create a plug-in in the workspace called "a.b.c" based on the "plug-in with a view" example
* Create an Eclipse Application launch using "features selected below" on the Plug-ins tab
* Select all features and add additional plug-in "a.b.c"
* Select the "External" radio button for "Default plug-in location"
* Apply
* Close/re-open
The additional plug-in is gone.
Looks like the bundle is removed from the list since it does not exist externally.
