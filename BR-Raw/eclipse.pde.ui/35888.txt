Bug 35888 – Adding extensions using plugin manifest editor
I encounter a couple of minor problems when using the plugin manifest editor to
add a builder extension to my plugin.
Here's what I did and the problems I
encountered:
1) I added a org.eclipse.core.resources.builder extension on the Extensions
page.
2) To this I added a "(buider)" and to this I added a "run".
3) I open the properties on the "run" and the default class name was missing an
I (the name was "ncrementatalProjectBuilder1") (Problem 1).
4) I then used the wizard (Java Attribute Editor) to change the class info and
generate a new builder class.
The resulting class did not use my defined Java
code template which has the proper copyright in it (Problem 2).
