Bug 68606 – New Plug-in Project wizard shows error when creating out-of the box project
I200406250010
1.
Start to create a new plug-in project
2.
select project name to be "My Plug-in"
3.
flip to next page
==> error is shown in status line (see attached picture)
I would expect that the wizard suggests working default values especially when
it was the wizard's decision to put the plug-in class into a package.
Note: with the error the status also showed the name (good) but when the project
name starts with uppercase (e.g.
MyPlugin) then the status shows the warning:
"By convention, package names usually start with a lower-case letter" without
telling which value on that page is wrong and there's no package field on the
wizard page, only a class field.
