Bug 232041 – Error Log view: boldening of session confusing
I20080513-2000
The Error Log view currently renders the first session in bold (when Group By > Session is selected).
I don't see why this would be useful.
It would be interesting to see the *current* session boldened.
But when no log entries are generated during start up, the *last* session with errors is boldened.
