Bug 197410 – Manifest completion proposals are not sorted
Version: 3.3.0
Build id: I20070625-1500
Some of the completion proposals on the manifest editor (for header completion) are out of order.
 The most obvious one is the fragment-host entry which appears at the bottom.
Will attach a patch to sort the list.
 It might make more sense to just use Arrays.sort() instead of manually ordering it.
