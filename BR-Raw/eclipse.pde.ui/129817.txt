Bug 129817 – New dependencies from templates no longer added
Eclipse 3.2 Build id: I20060221-1300
It seems that some change between the above build and the latest projects from HEAD has caused an issue where the dependencies that are programatically added by Template classes (i.e.
org.eclipse.pde.ui.ImportWizardTemplate) are no longer added.
For example, using the above build, if you create a new plug-in project, then add the Import Wizard Template (through the Extension tab on plugin.xml) a dialog should appear asking if a save of the plugin file is desired and the dependencies should appear under the Dependencies tab.
This does not occur using the latest projects from HEAD (or the latest build I20060228-1207).
Specifically the problem seems to have been created due to some change in the project org.eclipse.pde.core between version 2006/02/24 00:00:00 and 2006/02/25 00:00:00
