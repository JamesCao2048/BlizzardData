Bug 198175 – Double-click should expand nodes
In the PDE editors, we have many sections depicting trees, where double-clicking on a tree node does nothing.
By default, double-clicking should expand a collapsed node and collapse an expanded node (a la Package Explorer).
I suspect we can fix all the PDE cases by modifying the TreeSection superclass.
