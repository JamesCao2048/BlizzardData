Bug 173741 – A project created without build.properties files causes errors to be logged
EMF creates new projects without a build.properties file and generates one of these when the model is first generated.
 It looks like the PDE wants to generate a warning or perhaps error for a project with a missing build.properties file, but the logic is such that it tries to remove markers from the non-existing file
private void removeFileMarkers() {
try {
fFile.deleteMarkers(IMarker.PROBLEM, false, IResource.DEPTH_ZERO);
fFile.deleteMarkers(PDEMarkerFactory.MARKER_ID, false, IResource.DEPTH_ZERO);
} catch (CoreException e) {
PDECore.logException(e);
}
}
and then logs an error log entry.
