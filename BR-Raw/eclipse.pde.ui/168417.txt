Bug 168417 – Generated Ant Script to export plugin projects not working
Using export option in Manifest.mf file of eclipse I exported a plugin project
and with the option "Save as Ant Script" checked.
On running the saved ant script using the eclipse antrunner the jar file is not getting exported in the specified destination directory.
But I'm getting a message of Build-Successfull.
