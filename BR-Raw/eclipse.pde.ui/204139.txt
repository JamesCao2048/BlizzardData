Bug 204139 – Add a way to look for platform.xml in places other than default location
Many products there days are getting more and more complicated.
 With this complexity, some times the platform.xml is not always in the default location.
 It would be handy to be able to help point PDE to the location of a platform.xml if it is some where other than the default location.
