Bug 115484 – Allow PDE Export to read qualifiers from map (or provided) files
http://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html advises to use
'.qualifier' in the version number which gets replaced by PDE Build.
While PDE
Build can derive the qualifier from the map files this is currently not possible
when using PDE export.
This results in problems when copying an exported plug-in
into the an existing 'plugins' directory where the same plug-in already exists
because the generated version number (e.g.
4.2.3.20050507 is lexicographically
below the one from the map file (e.g.
4.2.3.v20050506).
Even better for us would be an ant task that replaces qualifiers for all
plug-ins and features in a given directory because we currently use our custom
export scripts mainly due to bug 101241.
