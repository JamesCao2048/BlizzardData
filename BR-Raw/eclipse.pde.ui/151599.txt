Bug 151599 – Info Presentation for manifest.mf attributes/headers
The XML content assist shows descriptions of elements and attributes in the proposal popup.
We should do the same for manifest.mf proposals for headers and attributes.
In the completion proposal popup, we should render the javadoc for these headers/attributes in html format, much like Ant and JDT do with javadoc.
