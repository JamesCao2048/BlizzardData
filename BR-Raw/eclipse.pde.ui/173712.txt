Bug 173712 – Plug-in Project from jar wizard fails to enable the Finish button
Build ID: I20070209-1006
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Use the wizard to create a plug-in project from a jar.
2.
Use an external jar.
 May work with others but only tested the external path since that is what I need.
3.
 When filling in the Plug-in Properties, fill in any other field before specifying the project name.
4.
The "Finish" button will now not be enabled even if you add all the correct information.
