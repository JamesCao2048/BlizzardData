Bug 312466 – early call to modify bundle root leaves WorkspacePluginModelManager un-initialized
It's possible to use the IBundleProjectService to set the root of a bundle.
If this is done before the PDE model managers are initialized, it can leave the WorkspacePluginModelManager in an un-initialized state.
It results in a call to 'removeModel(...)', and 'createModel(...)', which will quietly initlaize 'fModels' to a hashtable, and the next call to 'initialize()' will be ignored since 'fModels' is no longer null.
The result is that the model manager is not hooked up to listen to resource deltas.
