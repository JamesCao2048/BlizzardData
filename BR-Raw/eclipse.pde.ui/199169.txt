Bug 199169 – The plugin.xml structure merge viewer does not show document root
Using the latest pde.ui code from HEAD:
- Make at least one change to a plugin.xml file checked out from the repository.
- Synchronize the project containing the plugin.xml with HEAD.
- Double-click on the plugin.xml.
You will see a structural compare and a content compare.
- Double-click on a specific change from the structure compare area.
The content compare zooms to show just the affected range of the document.
Excellent.
BUG: Now that the document is zoomed to the change, there is no way to view the entire document again since we do not have a root element in the tree.
If you look at the Java merge viewer, for instance, the root element is the Compilation Unit which allows the user to reset the view back to the entire document.
