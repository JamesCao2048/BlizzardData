Bug 216703 – Validate dialog is too narrow
When you click the "Validate Bundles" button for an OSGi Framework launch configuration, violations are displayed in the "Validate" dialog.
 This dialog has a fixed size that is too small.
 Some possible enhancements:
1.
 Make the dialog wider, at least 600 pixels.
 Today you always have to resize
it to see the details of the violations.
2.
 Make the dialog resize itself based on the content.
 Harder to do, for sure.
3.
 Having resized the dialog the size is not persisted, which is rather
frustrating since you have to constantly resize it.
Note that this is a bug against Eclipse/PDE 3.3, and while it also applies to Eclipse/PDE 3.4, I'd sooner see the dialog banished, since it has such nasty usability characteristics.
 See bug 216690.
