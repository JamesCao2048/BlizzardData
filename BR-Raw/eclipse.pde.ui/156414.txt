Bug 156414 – Widget Disposed error when creating OSGi manifest
I had 2 3.0 projects with the info in plugin.xml.
 I used the "create OSGi manifest" link on the PDE Editor>Overview tab.
While updating the PDE editor with the newly created MANIFEST.MF, it generated an exception:
org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Widget is disposed
I'll attach the log.
