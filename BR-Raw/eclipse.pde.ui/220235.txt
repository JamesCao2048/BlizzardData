Bug 220235 – Project-specific Plug-in Manifest Compiler properties broken
I20080222-1622
- select a plug-in project
(I took org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring.tests from CVS)
- context menu > Properties > Plug-in Manifest Compiler
- enable 'Use project settings'
- OK
- open properties dialog again
=> 'Use project settings' disabled
It looks like the project-specific options are still saved and used, even though the properties page opens disabled.
