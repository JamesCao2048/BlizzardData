Bug 171962 – the value of a translatable attribute seems to be set twice
This happens all the time with translatable attributes.
For example,
1.
On the Extensions page of the plugin editor, press Add..
and choose the org.eclipse.core.runtime.content.contenttype extension point.
2.
right-click on the extension and select the content-type element.
The element will be created and selected, which is good.
 But observe how the 'name' attribute has a long qualified name.
 If you select the element again, the value of the 'name' attribute will now show 'name' as expected.
Is it that the value of the attribute is being set twice, but it's not refreshed after the second/good value is being set?
