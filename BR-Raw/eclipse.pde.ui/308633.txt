Bug 308633 – Feature based launch ignores version numbers
features are now all found from target platform
but creating a launch config feature based doesn't work very well
example:
the tp evolved for some features and plugins from
0.5.13 thru 0.5.15 and 0.5.16
if I define the launch config, the newest version (0.5.16) of these features
was displayed,
but the launched eclipse application has plug-ins from the oldest one (0.5.13)
even if I define dependencies to 0.5.16 minimum - always the oldest are
choosen,
so at the moment I cannot use the powerful new feature-based launch configs.
