Bug 266880 – [target] New import from target doesn't like spaces
On the import plug-in wizard, whenever the state is created, if any of the containers have spaces in the names the state doesn't included them.
 This applies to the active target, specific definitions or just pointing at a directory.
Also, if I go to the import wizard, click on the button to open the target platform preference page, set something as active, then close the preferences, when I return to the import wizard the combo has nothing selected.
 Since the next button is still enabled an NPE is thrown if next is clicked.
