Bug 185597 – Errors creating old-school plug-ins
build i0503-1400
- start Eclipse
- change target platform to r3.0.2
- File -> New -> Plug-in
- 3.0 old school style
- create an activator but won't contribute to UI
- Finish
When the build completes, there will be compile errors because it cannot find OSGi and runtime classes.
