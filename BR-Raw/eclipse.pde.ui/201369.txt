Bug 201369 – Deleting Extension Point (and file) causes problems
I stumbled upon this while testing Adam's patch for another bug.
 Steps to reproduce:
1.
Create new Plug-in Project (without a template)
2.
Switch to Extension Point tab
3.
Add new Extension Point.
4.
Schema editor opens, go back to Manifest Editor.
 Save file
5.
Delete schema.
Note how the object does not go away.
 It appears to be a side effect from fixing some selection work in this area.
 But the problem actually is that the underlying listeners are getting unregistered.
 When the Schema file is deleted, the plug-in listeners in the Manifest Editor are removed and hence the page does not get the updates since the corresponding listeners are removed.
