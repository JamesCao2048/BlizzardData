Bug 216937 – Missing "singleton:=true" directive does not result in a warning
Removing the "singleton:=true" directive from the Bundle-SymbolicName header no longer results in a warning.
 This worked in Eclipse 3.3, and is a regression in Eclipse 3.4 M4.
To reproduce, simply create a bundle that has a plugin.xml file.
 This is a case where the directive is required.
 When the directive is removed the warning should be issued, but it is not.
Unfortunately, when the directive is missing, the plugin.xml seems to be completely ignored at runtime, which as you can imagine, makes for some frustrating hours of plugin.xml debugging.
