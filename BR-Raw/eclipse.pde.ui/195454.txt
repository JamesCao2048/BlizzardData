Bug 195454 – PDE supplies -pdelaunch to IApplication launches, which is not stripped out by platform
When running an IApplication (see attached) the PDE launcher automatically appends -pdelaunch.
However, this argument isn't stripped out of the 'special arguments' with the result that it's visible to the runtime Eclipse application.
This behaviour is not seen when launching from the command line startApp, or presumably from the command line (though I've not tried the latter).
This project has a simple IApplication (.launch included) that runs and prints out 'application.args'.
When running from a PDE supplied launch (Launch as Eclipse Application, with selected class in -application) it's clear that it's passing the -pdelaunch to the runtime:
Hello RCP World![-pdelaunch]
Run from a startApp launch, you see:
Hello RCP World![]
This basically means you can't test IApplications from PDE that expect arguments.
You can run as an OSGi framework, so it's just this extraneous flag that's preventing it from working, so I'm flagging as major.
