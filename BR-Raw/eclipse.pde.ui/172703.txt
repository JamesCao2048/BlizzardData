Bug 172703 – Make the list of launch shortcuts in the PDE editor extensible
The Testing section on the Overview page of the plug-in editor contains two hard-coded links for launching an Eclipse application.
It would be interesting to make the list of launch shortcuts to be extensible via a PDE extension point.
Suggested markup:
<extension point="org.eclipse.pde.ui.launchShortcuts">
<shortcut id="org.eclipse.pde.ui.runtimeWorkbenchShortcut"              label="Launch an Eclipse application"
mode="run"/>
</extension>
All three attributes are required.
id refers to the ID of a legitimate/existing org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchShortcuts extension.
We will use the id to locate/instantiate the extension shortcut and call its launch(IEditorPart, mode) method.
Label is the translatable string that will go on the link.
Value for mode is one of three possibilities: run, debug, profile.
 It dictates the mode that we call the shortcut with and the icon that will appear next to the link.
You can find the icon for 'profile' under Window > Customize Perspective...
> Commands > Profile.
when showing the list of launch shortcuts, we should organize them by mode: run then debug then profile.
within each mode category, we should arrange the shortcuts in lexicographical order.
As a good test for this extension point, we should refactor out the hardcoded logic in launching an Eclipse application into standalone extensions.
