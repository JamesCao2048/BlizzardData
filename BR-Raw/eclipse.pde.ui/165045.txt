Bug 165045 – Import plugin with source leaves a warning about missing ---src.zip
After exporting a plug-in project with source the export includes a ---src.zip file for use when importing with source.
On import the build.properties file that is created references the --src.zip file.
But since the src zip was used on import but not imported itself there is a warning in the on the build.properties.
I tried including build.properties on export since it does not reference a --src.zip file but that file is ignored on import.
build.properies file created on import that includes the warning.
source.actions.jar = src-actions/
bin.includes = .project,\
about.html,\
actions.jar,\
actionssrc.zip,\     <== warning on this non-existant file
build.properties,\
