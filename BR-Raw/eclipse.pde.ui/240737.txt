Bug 240737 – [product] be able to set start levels on a product
For people who use DS in their applications or have any need to start things...
it's currently painful to do so.
Product Customization (Equinox Transforms) also suffers this fate.
For 3.5, we need to allow the product editor to define startlevels along with maybe some other properties.
As an example, 'osgi.framework.extensions' needs to be set to org.eclipse.equinox.transforms.hook for product customization.
