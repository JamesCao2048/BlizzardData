Bug 309795 – workspace didn't compile after restart - always have to reload Target Platform
Created attachment 165416 [details]
getting those errors after restart before reload
OSX 10.6.3
Eclipse SDK M6
cocoa-64
plus I-Build 20100414
If I restart Eclipse I always get many compile errors.
refresh / cleaning projects doesnt help.
I have to reload my Target Platform - from Preferences-TargetPlatform-Reload or opening the TargetPlatform Definition File in workspace, wait until resolved and the Set as TargetPlatform
...thought that perhaps it was a problem with bundlepooling or so - did a test with a fresh installation and a new workspace, cloned my projects from repository into workspace, set the target platform -
and all works ....
until I restart.
Then I always have to reload the Target Platform to get the projects compiled.
BTW: while testing with a fresh installation and a new workspace I got exceptions (see bug 309792)
