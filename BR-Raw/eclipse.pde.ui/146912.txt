Bug 146912 – AbstractModel needs to update NLResourceHelper when a bundle localization changes
When a bundle localization changes (ie.
using the NLS wizard on a bundle without a Bundle-Localization specified) the underlying bundle's AbstractModel needs to update it's NLResourceHelper.
The BundleErrorReporter reports missing nls keys (since its looking in the wrong .properties file) after such a change.
