Created attachment 120927 [details]
pde-runtime-serviceproperties-1.patch
Build ID: I20081211-1908
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create a (RCP) app exposing some OSGi services
2.
Launch it with the PDE Runtime oplugin included
3.
Open the PDE Plugin Registry
4.
Open Properties view
5.
Locate the OSGi service in the Plugin Registry
6.
No service properties shown
More information:
The Plugin registry is an invaluable tool, when inspecting and diagnosing problems from within a RCP application.
Unfortunately it is very difficult to determine whether a specific OSGI service is registered or used, as the Plugin Registry simply shows the service by its registered interfaces.
The attached patch for the PDE Runtime plugin provides a simple IPropertySource and adapter for the Properties View, which lists the service properties.
