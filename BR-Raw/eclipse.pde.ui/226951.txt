Bug 226951 – Builder should use analyser, and create its own markers
Doing some introspection on our builder while fixing bug 226745, there are a few things we could probably change.
Currently we have a problem reporter that is used for each instance of our builder, which accepts problems and once the build is done creates markers (as needed).
This works well, but is not quite as flexible as we could be.
For example, if we used the notion of an analyser that could do all of the api analysis, create problems, etc.
and when the build is done give the problems back to the builder to create markers (as needed).
This way clients (if there are any in the future) could provide their own analyser and all we do is call it in a consistent way and create markers (if any) once the builder is done.
