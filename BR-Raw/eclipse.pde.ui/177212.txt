Bug 177212 – Dependency View does not update upon models being removed
During refactoring work, I found the Dependency View does not update when the focused model is removed.
 This can cause wierd things to happen.
 For instance, these steps produce an NPE in the Manifest Editor:
1.
Create plug-in project with unique name (not in target platform).
2.
Focus on it in the Dependencies View
3.
Delete the project
4.
Double click on the project
Instead of fixing the Manifest Editor, we should look at refocusing the Dependency View when the focused model is removed.
