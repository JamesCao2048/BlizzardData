Bug 309693 – Extra workspace jobs created auto-removing unused filters

proposed fix
Trying to reproduce bug 309635, I found that our builder will call-back to the a filter stores' removeAPIFilters(..) method even if there are no filters to remove (with auto-remove filters turned on).
This call-back creates a workspace job and causes work in the filter store for no reason.
I also found that this can cause a resource exception if the job runs while the project is being deleted.
The patch prevents the spurious jobs from being created and checks for the existence of the parent resource before blindly trying to create resources.
