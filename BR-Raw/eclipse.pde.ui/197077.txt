Bug 197077 – [Schema][Editors] Read-only description section is writable
Latest code from head
1.
Open a .exsd file directly from the CVS Repositories view (ie.
a read-only schema).
2.
Go to the Definition tab of the schema editor and select an attribute.
Note how the description section is editable.
 It should be read-only like the the other editor sections.
