Bug 198927 – Provide error reporting around invalid Bundle-ManifestVersion's
I20070806-0010
I accidentally updated the Bundle-ManifestVersion instead of the Bundle-Version and from then on PDE's manifest compiler stopped reporting any errors and warnings on that bundle.
It seems that the compiler aborts without notice.
Test Case:
1.
open a manifest.mf that has errors and/or warnings
2.
set the Bundle-ManifestVersion to '3.3.100'
==> compiler no longer reports anything.
I'm marking this as major because all other PDE related features like updating of the PDE container when updating the required bundles section no longer works too.
It took me a while to find my error.
