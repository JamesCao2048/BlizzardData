Bug 102326 – Feature and Fragment Export JarSigning dialog needs keypass field.
Java keystores ( JKS, JCEKS format), and keytool allow for creating signing
certificates with a keypass.
  If a signing certificate has been stored in the
keystore with a keypass, it can not be used for signing with the present
implementation.
  The keypass field value can be optionally supplied (i.e.
can
be left blank if the associated keyEntry value has not been stored with a keypass).
Please add a keypass field to the JarSigning Wizard page, and update any ant
build templates as specified in "Bugzilla Bug 100534 Support for jarsigning in
PDE scripts".
