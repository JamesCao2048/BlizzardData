Bug 319965 – New Feature Project->Referenced Plug-ins and Fragments multiselection functionality
Build Identifier: 20100617-1415
Currently when creating a new Feature Project and after clicking Next you get 'Referenced Plug-Ins and Fragments dialog' and you have to check every plug in separately, because there is no multiselection possibility.
If someone wants to add many plug-ins to feature it's not very convenient.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to File->New->Other->Plug-In Development->Feature Project
2.
Write Project name and click 'Next'
3.
Now you can see 'Select All' and 'Deselect All' buttons or you can simply click a checkbox next to plugin name.
There are no means to multiselect e.g.
10 plugins with two simple user actions for example highlighting wanted plugins.
