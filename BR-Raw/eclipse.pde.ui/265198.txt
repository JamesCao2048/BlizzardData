Bug 265198 – [target] make sure we warn about forward compatibility
In the current target platform preference page, we added some logic to warn people if they were developing against a target platform in the future.
That is, if you are running Eclipse 3.4, and pointing to a 3.5 target...
that's evil.
We should provide some type of warning for this case in the new target story.
