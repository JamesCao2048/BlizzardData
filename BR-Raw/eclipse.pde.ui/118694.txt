Bug 118694 – Simplify use of config.ini in launcher
The Eclipse application launcher allows you to select a custom config.ini from the workspace, filesystem, or via a variable.
 It would seem that many times, especially in RCP environments, the config.ini file from the target platform would be the best config.ini to use when launching the platform.
 The launcher should make it easier to select a config.ini from the target platform.
