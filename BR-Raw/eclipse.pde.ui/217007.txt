Bug 217007 – Support for Eclipse-BundleShape header
See bug 157562.
Does PDE-UI need to add support for Eclipse-BundleShape?  At a minimum PDE could check if the header value is valid ('jar' or 'dir').
 More advanced would be to place some option on the UI to set this.
 Not sure how prominent we would want to make this option.
