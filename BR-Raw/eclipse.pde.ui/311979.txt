Bug 311979 – Validate/Add Required on junit plug-in launch does not consider both 'application' and 'app to test'
1) Open a new junit plug-in launch configuration and select a test that can run headless
2) Uncheck run in UI thread
3) Set the application to [No Application]
4) Open the plug-ins tab, deselect all
5) Check a non-UI plug-in
6) Hit select all required
7) Hit validate (everything should be good to go)
8) Launch
Result:
Launch fails because it can't find the "org.eclipse.pde.junit.runtime.nonuithreadtestapplication" application.
The above steps will illustrate the problem, but there are other configurations that can have the same result.
In Eclipse Launch configs there is a single application to launch.
 In JUnit Plug-in configs there can be two applications to launch -application and -testApplication.
 The plugins tab only checks -application when validating and adding required plug-ins.
The solution is not as straightforward as checking both applications during validate.
 When the "Run in UI thread" checkbox is unchecked, only -application is set, but the launch delegate will change the attributes.
 The solution is probably to move the logic from the delegate to the Main Tab (which we are already subclassing).
