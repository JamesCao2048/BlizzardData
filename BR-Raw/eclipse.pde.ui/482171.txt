Bug 482171 – PackageSelectionDialog filter should use contains instead of startswith
When using the PackageSelectionDialog to select the packages for Import-Package in a Manifest editor from PDE, the filter always expects to start with the package root.
For example, let's say I have a package structure like
org.eclipse.e4.core.services
org.eclipse.e4.core.contexts
with subpackages for each.
Now if I want to find a package below services I have to enter the full path or *.services to have the filter work.
But I would like to enter only services and find all packages that contain services in the path.
To be honest, I'm not sure if this is JDT because of the PackageSelectionDialog or if this is something special for PDE.
But if you give me a hint, I would also be interested in contributing.
I just haven't found the right place or idea to fix this.
