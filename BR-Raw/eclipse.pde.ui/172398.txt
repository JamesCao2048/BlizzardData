Bug 172398 – [API] no visible difference between getValue and getReplacementString in AbstractTemplateSection
In the AbstractTemplateSection, we have two function: .getValue(String key) and .getReplacementString(String fileName, String key).
 When generating a source folder, a call is made to .getValue().
 When substituting keys in a file, .getReplacementString is called.
 Unfortunately, they resolve the same key (packageName) differently.
 This is the cause of bug 172230.
We should look at why we have two functions that resolve keys.
 I would recommend that if we keep both functions, they resolve the same key using the same code.
