Bug 113004 – Plug-in dependencies UI element disappears when using working-set
Build: I20051011-1330
In a Package Explorer view (with no working-set selected), open a PDE project
and notice the "Plug-in Dependencies" element is shown in the project.
Create a "Plug-ins and Fragments" working set that contains the same project,
and select the working set.
 Notice that the "Plug-in Dependencies" disappears
from the view.
 This was unexpected.
