Bug 61184 – Browse button on extension page does not work
Build id: 200405060200
When i press the browse button an attribute in the extension editor it does
nothing for Class and Resource attribute types.
 I am editing a source
plugin.xml file, not a read only plugin.
The overrides of isReferenceModel in the Class and Resource rows is returning
the editable state of the model.
 This is true for a source plugin which then
causes the button to do nothing (it only works when !isReferenceModel()).
Should the class and resource rows be overriding this method?  I removed the
overrides and it seemed to work fine.
btw, love the new look of the editor :)
