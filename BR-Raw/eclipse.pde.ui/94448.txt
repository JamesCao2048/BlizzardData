Bug 94448 – The addition of an extension or extension-point must set the singleton directive
I20050510-0010
Create a new plugin using the default options of the wizard.
You end up with a
plugin that has a manifest.mf and no plugin.xml.
Everything is fine.
Now add an extension or an extension point using the editor.
Run, you will notice that the extension is not present.
This is because the
extension registry rejects all contributions that are not done by a singleton
bundle.
PDE should automatically add and always ensure that the singleton directive is
present if there is an extension or an extension point in a plugin.
