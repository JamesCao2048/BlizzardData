Bug 148687 – Extension Point enhancement
When using the "New Extension" wizard and want to add a new perspective, it would be great to improve the filter.
The name "filter" means in my eyes that the e.g.
the "org.eclipse.ui.perspectives" extension point can be found with the filter "per".
This would be a great thing to select the extension points faster.
It should filter the extension points like the  "Superclass Selection".
If you are interested, i would like to try to write a patch for this enhancement.
