Bug 96962 – Quickfix to solve restriction access problem
I20050527
This morning I opened an existing workspace that was compiling fine yesterday (I
did not try to run it and it was not the point), and I've noticed that it was no
longer compiling because the type I was refering was "not accessible due to
access restrictions".
It tooks me a second or two before thinking that it could be that the plugin
providing the type was not exporting the proper package.
I fixed the package
export and everything worked.
Trivial.
However I think for new comers to eclipse or even long time users this is not
trivial.
This problem must have a quick fix guiding the users on things that can
be done to solve the problem.
I mark as major since to me this is a major usability issue
