Bug 315039 – [patch] Eclipse launch configuration should inherit properties from target platform
When creating a new Eclipse launch configuration from a target platform not containing products but an application PDE correctly recognizes the default application.
However, due to the fix for bug 175437 all config.ini properties inherited from the target platform are cleared during launching.
My observation is that this fix is too drastic.
The requirement in bug 175437 only talks about the splash screen.
In this case the products indeed don't match.
However, I have a case where I create a new Eclipse launch config based on an
Eclipse application from my target platform.
PDE correctly recognizes the
application in config.ini and sets the proper default application to launch.
However, because of this fix other important properties are not copied.
