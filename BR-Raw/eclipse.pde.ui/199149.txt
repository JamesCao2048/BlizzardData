Bug 199149 – Manifest highlighting needed in other PDE refactoring areas
There are a few areas in PDE where we refactor Manifest files which do not have Manifest syntax highlighting.
 Adam has been working hard to make the Organize Manifest and Externalize Wizards so pretty, it has made the other PDE refactoring look ugly by comparison.
We need to help spread the beauty though more of PDE refactoring so none of the current refactoring classes feel like ugly step children.
