Bug 230987 – [ds] DSAddItemAction isn't raising IModelChangedEvent.INSERT event
When we add a new Element to DS model, the class DSAddItemActions is called.
When the class DSAddItemAction creates and adds a new IDSObject to the DS model it should raise IModelChangedEvent.INSERT event to be caught by modelChanged() method.
But it isn't working.
This Problem should resolve the refresh problem while adding new elements in the DSMasterTreeSection.
