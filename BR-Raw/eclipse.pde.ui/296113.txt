Bug 296113 – RemotePluginTestRunner should issue better message when test plug-in not resolved
HEAD
RemotePluginTestRunner currently prints "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No Classloader found for plug-in org.eclipse.core.expressions.tests" when the test plug-in could not be resolved, e.g.
in the scenario from bug 296105.
"No Classloader found" does not tell the user what the problem is.
Could you please change the message in RemotePluginTestRunner#getClassLoader(String) to something like this, so that the user knows why this happens:
throw new IllegalArgumentException("No Classloader found for plug-in " + pluginId + " (plug-in was not resolved)"); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$
