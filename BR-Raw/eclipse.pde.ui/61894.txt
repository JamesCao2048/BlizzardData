Bug 61894 – Sort plugin dependencies and feature content automatically in manifest files
In plugin.xml editor, when you add required plugins on the Dependencies tab,
they are always presented lexicografically sorted, which is good for
readability.
I believe it's reasonable to sort them (the <import plugin="..."/>
elements) the same way in the plugin.xml source.
The same applies for feature content ("Feature Plug-ins and Fragments" in
feature.xml editor, corresponding <plugin> elements in source) as well as
feature dependencies (the <requires> section in source).
The related point is, that even when managing the manifest files using the
visual editors only (and not touching the source), one comes across the xml
version when synchronizing with repository and doing file comparisons.
In these
case, having the items sorted improves readability and may also prevent some
conflicts (caused by different order only).
