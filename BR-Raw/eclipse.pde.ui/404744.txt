Bug 404744 – Flag tags as invalid if parent type is private or package default
From Bug 402393
I found an issue with our invalid tag scanner, it appears it does not thoroughly check the visibility of the a member.
Consider the following example:
public class PublicStaticInner {
static class Inner {
/**
* @noinstantiate This class is not intended to be instantiated by clients.
* @noextend This class is not intended to be subclassed by clients.
*/
public static class OpenInner {
/**
* @noreference This method is not intended to be referenced by clients.
*/
public static void one() {
System.out.println("one");
}
}
}
}
Those tags are not flagged as invalid when they should be.
