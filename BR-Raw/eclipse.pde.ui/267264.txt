Bug 267264 – [target] Add group by location to EditProfileContainerWizard
People have been asking for the ability to see the bundles in their target grouped by location.
 This was possible before the new target story.
 While we already separate this in a more transparent manner for directories and features, installations can come from multiple locations.
 Users with installations that point to multiple extension locations want to be able to include/exclude different locations.
In M7 we may have to rethink the UI to support this scenario better (alogn with other enhancements like adding required bundles).
 However, for M6 we should offer a group by location option when editing a Profile/Installation container.
