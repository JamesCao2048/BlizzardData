Bug 95935 – Schema Preview should open in external browser
3.1 M7
go to the Window > prefereces > Plug-in Development > Target Platform
preference page.
Switch to the Source Code Locations tab.
Click on the 'org.eclipse.pde.core.source' link
You will see that the schema description opens in the internal browser, which
is usually desired, but not in this case since the preferences dialog is up.
In this face, we should force the preview to come up in an external browser.
So the open schema action should have two modes: default, and forceExternal.
