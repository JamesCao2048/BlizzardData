Bug 307149 – Adding import packages to Manifest.MF does not cause rebuild
Build Identifier: 3.6
Imported packages added to the Manifest.MF file will not be used to build the bundle till you start eclipse.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create an OSGi bundle and add some java files importing packages that are outside the bundle.
2.
Observe that the java files have the errors that the packages cannot be resolved.
2.
Edit the Manifest.MF to import these packages.
by adding (Import-Packages: xxx)
3.
Observe that the errors that the packages cannot be resolved are still there.
(the imported packages that are added to Manifest.MF are not taken into consideration in building my bundle).
4.
Restart eclipse.
5.
All the errors are gone and all the packages are resolved.
6.
After this first time, if I remove the imported packages, I get the errors ( which is expected)
7.
When I add them back the errors are resolved (which is expected)
The incorrect behavior is only the first time the packages are added to the Manifest.MF.
