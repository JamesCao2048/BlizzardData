Bug 126796 – Product Editor Overview page goes grey and is unusable
Create a new blank Product Editor.
 By default, the product should be based on plugins.
 Click the plugins radio button again.
 This causes the Overview page to lose all controls and become a grey block.
This is because when the editor tries to update the configuration page, it finds the index of the features config page.
 Since the features config page has not been added to the editor yet (since by default it contains the plugins config page).
 The index returned from the usused page is 0, and the first page (Overview page) is then removed as a result.
