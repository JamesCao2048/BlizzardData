Bug 396429 – Samples cannot be loaded from the welcome page
While testing Kepler M4 candidate, I noticed the Welcome page links ends up loading the wrong version of SWT examples.
First, I had already loaded them, from "examples repo" downloaded from the DL webpage, so was surprised to see they had to be downloaded at all ...
but ...
I said "yes" when prompted.
Second, it loaded some old ones.
They were "unsigned".
Said version 3.3.0.
And, one (imported into workspace) had an error in manifest.mf in that it still required org.eclipse.core.boot (which is no longer in SDK).
These were named "Experimental Eclipse SDK Samples".
Current ones are named "Eclipse SDK Samples".
I'm not sure what/where the SWT "samples URL" is specified, but will open this in releng to start off.
As far as I know, this has been a problem for a while (not a regression?) but have not checked explicitly.
