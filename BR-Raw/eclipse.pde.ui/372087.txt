Bug 372087 – Splash in exported product not found
Currently the editor for the product definition files says the following:
-----------
The splash screen appears when the product launches.
 If its location is not specified, the 'splash.bmp' file is assumed to be in the product's defining plug-in.
-----------
If the location is not specified, this works well if the product is started from Eclipse but if the plugin is not set the exported product will not find its splashscreen.
Looks like the following entry is not added to config.ini:
osgi.splashPath=platform:/base/plugins/com.example.rcp.demo
I suggest to change either the text or add the entry to config.ini.
Text changes might be faster.
