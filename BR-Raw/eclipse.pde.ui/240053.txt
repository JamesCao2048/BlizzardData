Bug 240053 – product export from the ui does not generate bundles.info
in 3.4
When you have a product that include (directly or indirectly) the simple configurator, exporting that product from the UI does not produce a bundles.info file.
 however, biulding the product with the releng build mechanism does.
 This is a pretty significant issue for people trying to create products in the new world.
Suggest looking at this for 3.4.1
