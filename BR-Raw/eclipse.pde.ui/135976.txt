Bug 135976 – Enhance PDE support for extension points specifying a namespace
The runtime has included support for extension points specifying a namespace other than the contributing plugin's id (bug 112856).
Currently, PDE's extension point wizard does not allow the user to type in a '.' in the id field.
 Also, PDE puts an error on the plugin.xml that uses an extension with a namespace other than the plugin id.
 It warns of an "Unknown extension point".
These are two examples of areas where we might modify PDE to make it more user friendly to utilize new runtime functionality.
