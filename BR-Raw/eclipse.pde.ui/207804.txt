Bug 207804 – Extension Registry methods don't account for multiple versions
The accessor methods in PDEExtensionRegistry don't account for multiple versions  of a plug-in.
 Instead some methods take an String id as a parameter.
 This does not work if two plug-ins have the same id.
 Instead, the methods should take an IPluginModelBase when necessary which can differentiated between two plug-ins with  different versions.
