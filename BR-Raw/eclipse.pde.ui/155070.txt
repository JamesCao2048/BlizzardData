Bug 155070 – Exporting feature and saving as an Ant script generates non-functional script
When you export "Deployable features" an option is given to create an Ant script that can be used to repeat the export at a later time.
 This is a rather useful option, but sadly the generated Ant script is not what I would expect:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project default="feature_export" name="build">
<target name="feature_export"/>
</project>
This is all you get and there are no error reported by the UI or in the .log file.
