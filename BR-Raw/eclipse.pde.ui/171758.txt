Bug 171758 – Properties? what properties?
1.
Open the plugin.xml for the org.eclipse.pde.core plug-in
2.
Go the extensions tab and select any one of the org.eclipse.core.resources.builders extensions and expand it.
3.
Select the (runtime) element
Note how the label in the Extension Details section tells you to "set the properties for that element and required elements are denoted by *"
This label is inappropriate since that element takes no attributes.
The label should say "The selected element has no properties to set."
This is another good bug in that it demonstrates the other type of externalization in Eclipse.
