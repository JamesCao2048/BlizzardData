Bug 181343 – [Plug-in Dependencies View] Fragment shows itself as dependency
1.
Focus on org.eclipse.swt.win32 (with fragments option on)
2.
You will see that the tree shows the host
org.eclipse.swt but it should not show the fragment itself as a dependency.
3.
In the flat layout mode, again both host and fragment are listed.
 It should only show host.
