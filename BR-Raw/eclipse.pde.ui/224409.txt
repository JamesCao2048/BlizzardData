Bug 224409 – The ability to mark extension points as "internal"
PDE allows developers to mark packages as being internal and flags users using these internal packages.
I think the same logic can be applied to extension points.
There are cases when extension points are "internal" user only and not ready for public consumption yet.
We have a couple examples of this throughout the SDK.
