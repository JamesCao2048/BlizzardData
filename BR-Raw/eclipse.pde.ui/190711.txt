Bug 190711 – [target] Add ability to export the artifacts for a target
3.3 RC3
If you create a .target file, and specify a list of plugins that comprise that target, it would be nice to be able to export that target as a directory of plugins, pulled from the environment you are running in.
This could be done either in the target editor (Overview or Content pages), or in the Export menu with the target file selected, or both.
A more comprehensive wizard would set the runtime for execution to be that exported target directory.
