Bug 154292 – Project-specific Java compliance should update build.properties
When I edit project-specific preferences in the JDT GUI, and change the compiler compliance settings to 1.4-with-assert, I'd expect the build.properties file to be updated automatically (javacSource, javacTarget properties).
This is necessary in order to support headless builds e.g.
for creating an update site.
If the build.properties file is not updated automatically, it's just too easy to break the headless build with something that seems to work fine in the UI build.
