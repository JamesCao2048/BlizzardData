Bug 166795 – variables in config.ini template field don't stick
I20061128-0800
If you use a variable to point to a config.ini template in the workspace (i.e.
${workspace_loc}\demo.eclipse.tracing\config.ini) then PDE seems to fill in the correct information when you launch.
 But then if you open the launcher again you will notice that the ${workspace_loc} variable has been replaced with the real absolute path to your workspace.
 All other fields in PDE seem to keep the variable and do not modify the value with the real path.
I ran into this issue following the instructions at the AspectJ incubator site http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/incubator/aspects/getting_started.php
The demos in the incubator include launchers that point to workspace config.ini templates.
 The problem is the launchers include absolute paths the the workspace the developer was using when they specified the launchers.
 It would be nice if these launchers could be released with ${workspace_loc} variables but PDE UI prevents this.
