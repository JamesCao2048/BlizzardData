Bug 196874 – [Manifest][Editors] Selection behaviour is wrong after delete in Extension section tree viewer
Steps To Reproduce:
(1) Open manifest editor
(2) Switch to "Extensions" page
(3) Select any object within the tree viewer in the "All Extensions" section
(4) Press delete
-> BUG: Selection is lost and details section goes blank
The correct selection behaviour after the deletion is as follows:
* If there are N objects on the same level in the hierarchy and the
Nth object is deleted, the N-1th object should be selected
* If there are N objects on the same level in the hierarchy and any
object 1 to N-1 is deleted, the N+1th object should be selected
* If N=1 objects on the same level in the hierarchy and object 1 is
deleted, the parent object should be selected (no more children on the
same level)
This behaviour is applicable when the delete is performed using the
corresponding keyboard shortcut, or context menu and when invoking a cut
operation.
This behaviour is implemented by the Simple Cheat Sheet Editor - if you need a
reference.
