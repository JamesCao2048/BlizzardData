Bug 283588 – [target] target editor help acting strange, possibly incorrect context hookup
Clicking on the help button at the top right opens the dynamic help to the right page.
 But if you click and hold (keeping the button depressed) a generic workbench help page comes up.
 Also, if you have the dynamic help up for the editor, sometimes clicking on different things in the editor will open the same generic help page.
