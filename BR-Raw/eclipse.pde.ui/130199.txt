Bug 130199 – Package navigation in ManifestEditor
Double-clicking on a package in the Exported/Imported Packages sections of the manifest editor should navigate to that package in the Package Explorer
The action should also be available as an 'Open' context menu item in those viewers.
If the package does not exist in the workspace, then fail gracefully as we do when you double-click on a non-existent bundle in the Require-Bundle viewer.
