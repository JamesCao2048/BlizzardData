Bug 184041 – Changing target environment does not update the plugin container
I20070418-1012
I have noticed that when I change my target environment the plug-in dependencies do not get updated which can cause problems.
Here are steps to reproduce:
- start eclipse
- create a plug-in with some UI dependencies
- expand the plug-in dependencies and notice that the swt fragment for your platform is present.
good.
- change the target platform to point at an RCP based target containing the delta pack.
reload.
apply.
the plug-in dependencies are left unchanged.
good.
- now modify the environment variables in the target platform to something else, notice that the reference to the swt fragment is not modified properly.
