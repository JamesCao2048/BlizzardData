Bug 256343 – update API tooling tags to avoid errors
Created attachment 118631 [details]
patch
With the addition of the @noextend tag for interfaces, PDE needs to make these minimal changes.
This adds the @noextend to to interfaces already documented as @noimplement.
We should probably re-visit other API types, as it looks like not all tags were added in 3.4 that should have been.
For example, IPlugin does not specify @noimplement, but I don't think a client is ever expected to implement this interface.
