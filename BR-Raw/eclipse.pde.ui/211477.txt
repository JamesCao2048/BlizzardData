Bug 211477 – Preference Pages opened from Import Plug-in Wizard have wrong parent
The shell specified when opening the preferences page from the Plug-in Import wizard is incorrect.
 The one currently specified is the one from the main IDE.
 Since we are in a wizard, we need to instead specify the Shell of the wizard dialog.
