Bug 197906 – The plugin.xml compare viewer does not react to color changes
Using the latest pde.ui code from HEAD:
1.
Make a change to a plugin.xml file checked out from the repository.
2.
Synchronize the project containing the plugin.xml with HEAD.
3.
Double-click on the plugin.xml.
 You will see a structural compare with nice syntax coloring.
 Great.
4.
Now go to the Plug-in Development > Editors preference page and change some the XML syntax color values.
 Press OK.
The compare viewer does not update.
 It has to be closed and reopened.
By contrast, the plugin.xml editor has a listener that automatically updates its color scheme.
 The compare viewer should be as smart.
