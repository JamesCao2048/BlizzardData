Bug 96828 – PDE Preference Target Platform is expensive
When I do Window > Preferences > PDE > Target Platorm, it takes a long time to
show the preference page (about 6 seconds for 3.1M7 while the UI is blocked
and is unresponsive to any clicking - while not giving any feedback such as
hour-glass cursor).
When I do the same for RAD6.0 with 1049 plugins, my Eclipse is unresponsive
for 30 seconds.
Then, a ProgressMonitorDialog shows up that runs for 25
seconds.
Problem 1.
This dialog should not leave the UI in an unresponsive state for so
long.
When I profile Window > Preferences > PDE > Target Platorm, roughly half the
time is spent in the second tab ("Environment and JRE"), a tab I personally
NEVER click on.
The call to java.util.Locale.getAvailableLocales() uses 2,5
seconds and makes 1,5 million methods calls while reading 27MB from disk.
Problem 2.
The Environment tab is hardly used and should be filled lazily or
we should find a faster way to list available locales.
