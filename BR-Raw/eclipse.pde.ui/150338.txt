Bug 150338 – [Content Assist] proposals should be case-insensitive
It would be cool if the content assist proposals were case-insensitive across the board in MANIFEST.MF and plugin.xml files.
MANIFEST.MF:
- package names
- header names
- attributes and their values
- directives and their values
plugin.xml:
- <extension> <extension-point> and other elements
- attribute names
For example, when I type 'org.eclipse.ui.actions' in the 'point' attribute of an <extension> element, I should still see 'org.eclipse.ui.actionSets' as a proposal.
