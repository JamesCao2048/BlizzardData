Bug 90102 – Search for package references in 'Export Packages' section
A really useful function would be to offer a search for references to the
selected package in 'Export Packages' section.
You can easily hook the JDT
search API.
The goal would be to see who is using the internal packages and if
we care to make them 'friends'.
