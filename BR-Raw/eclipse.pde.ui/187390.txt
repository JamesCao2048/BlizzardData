Bug 187390 – Call super implementation from FormFilteredTree.doCreateTreeViewer
Could you please change FormFilteredTree.doCreateTreeViewer to call the super implementation? Like this:
protected TreeViewer doCreateTreeViewer(Composite parent, int style) {
TreeViewer viewer = super.doCreateTreeViewer(parent, toolkit.getBorderStyle());
toolkit.paintBordersFor(viewer.getTree().getParent());
return viewer;
}
I have to put in code to safeguard against changes to the tree while the filtered tree is showing (see bug 187200).
Without calling the super implementation, you will be left with an unoptimized filtered tree as of 3.3 RC1.
