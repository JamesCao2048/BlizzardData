Bug 114779 – PDE UI doesnt allow plug-in exporting unless target platform environment matches the plug-in platform filter
A couple of issues here...
I have several plug-ins that make use of the Eclipse-PlatformFilter header,
filtering on os/ws/arch.
 Trying to export all of these plug-ins at once from
the workspace results in only one os/ws/arch combination to be produced, with
no indication as to why the others aren't being exported.
 Seems I can only
export a plug-in if it matches the current target platform environment, and
that only allows me to set one configuration (not multiple configurations like
I'm able to do in PDE build).
Also, I have noticed that when I modify a value in the target platform
environmnet (say, the Architecture from win32 to arm -- typed in, since it's
editable and arm is not available in the dropdown) the setting does not take
effect until the target platform is reloaded.
 And when I close the
preferences and then reopen and return to the target platform environment
settings, the Architecture dropdown now shows "arm,arm".
