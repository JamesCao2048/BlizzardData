Bug 116919 – Plug-in Manifest Editor loses dependency addition
Build 3.2 M3
WinXP
My steps:
1.
I started with a 3.0-style (plugin.xml, not manifest.mf) plugin which was
referencing 2 plugins that I'd just deleted from my workspace.
2.
Open plugin.xml in the plugin editor and go to the Dependencies tab.
3.
Add a new plugin dependency.
4.
(without saving first), remove the dependency on the 2 deleted plugins.
5.
Save.
The Dependency tab correctly shows the added plugin and not the deleted
plugins.
6.
Close the editor and reopen.
7.
The added plugin dependency is gone.
This is a real nightmare for development because of the fact that (until you
close and reopen) the editor shows the added plugin, but it's not actually added
to the file so any references to code in this plugin won't compile.
