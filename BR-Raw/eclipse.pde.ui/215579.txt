Bug 215579 – ModelEntry.getBestCandidate() makes bad choices
The method IPluginModelBase getBestCandidate(IPluginModelBase[] models) of class org.eclipse.pde.core.plugin.ModelEntry has two flaws in it.
1.
The logic for rejecting disabled bundles is completely broken (only time it happens is if a disabled bundle was found in a previous iteration in the for loop.
In all other cases a disabled bundle can be chosen).
2.
The version comparison will select the bundle with the lowest version.
So, if you have versions 1.0.0, 1.1.0, and 2.0.0 installed, the 1.0.0 is disabled, then 1.0.0 will still be considered the best candidate.
In my opinion, it should be the enabled plug-in with the highest version.
