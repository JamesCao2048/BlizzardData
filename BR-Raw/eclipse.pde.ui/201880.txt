Bug 201880 – Plugin Registry view shows incorrect information from other versions
Created attachment 77453 [details]
Suggested bugfix
Build ID: I20070625-1500 (Affects cvs head as of today too)
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Install a plugin with multiple versions in a packaged Eclipse installation (NOT in Runtime Workbench!)
2.
Open the view PDE Runtime > Plug-In Registry (Registry Browser)
3.
Expand both plugin versions.
Both show same location although they should differ.
Example:
org.example.plugin_1.0.0 points to plugins/org.example.plugin_1.0.0.jar
org.example.plugin_1.0.1 points to plugins/org.example.plugin_1.0.0.jar
org.example.plugin_1.0.2 points to plugins/org.example.plugin_1.0.0.jar
org.example.plugin_1.0.3 points to plugins/org.example.plugin_1.0.0.jar
More information:
This is a bug in the UI only!
The RegistryBrowserContentProvider identifes the items to be displayed solely on the symbolic name of a Bundle and does not take the version into account.
The content provider should use another identification of the bundle, e.g.
the bundle reference itself or at least the bundleId.
Fix is easy: fPluginMap should contain <BundleId,Object[]> instead of <BundleSymbolicName,Object[]>.
See attached patch.
