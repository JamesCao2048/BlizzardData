Bug 149976 – Automated Management of Dependencies: The "add dependencies" link can result in an illegally formatted Import-Package header
The format of MANIFEST.MF is rather strict.
 One of the constraints is that a single line cannot be too long.
 I think that "too long" is something like 70 characters, but you'd have to check the JAR spec to be sure.
Anyway, the "add dependencies" link in the Automated Management of Dependencies section of the Dependencies page of the manifest editor can result a very long Import-Package header that is all on one line.
 In every other case I've seen the PDE does a nice job of breaking the line such that it is never too long.
 The scenario where this happens is rather specific:
1.
 Create a new plug-in project.
2.
 Populate the Automated Management of Dependencies list of with a bunch of
bundles against which you are going to compute your Import-Package list.
3.
 Write some Java code that creates dependencies on a bunch of packages
contained in the bundles listed in step 2.
4.
 Ensure that the MANIFEST.MF source page DOES NOT have an Import-Package
header.
 Save the editor.
 Note: This step is very important since this
problem only seems to happen when the Import-Package header needs to be
added.
5.
 Turn to the Dependencies page and click the "add dependencies" link.
 Save
the editor.
6.
 Turn to the MANIFEST.MF source page and inspect the Import-Package header.
Assuming that you have creating enough package dependencies in your code, this should result in an Import-Package header being added that is way too long.
 It will all be on one line.
The "add dependencies" link should implement the same formatting rules as the other parts of the manifest editor to ensure that the manifest remains legal.
