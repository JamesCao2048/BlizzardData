Bug 188168 – Errors in Workspace dialog is displayed twice
I20070517-1700
The Framework may request to be restarted for several reasons.
 If you have a workspace with a project that has an error then when launching you will get the "Errors in Workspace" dialog.
 This is fine, but if the Framework requests to restart while the application is running then the "Errors in Workspace" dialog is displayed again.
The dialog should only be displayed each time the launcher is used, but not when a restart is requested by the Framework.
I will attach a workspace and instructions to reproduce.
