Bug 147494 – Automated Management of Dependencies: Provide "Up" and "Down" buttons
The Automated Management of Dependencies section of the manifest editor displays bundles in the order that they were added to the list.
Since it seems that the order is significant, "Up" and "Down" buttons should be provided so that the bundles can be re-ordered easily.
 When adding these buttons, please make sure that they work equally well for a single selection as well as a multiple selection (both contiguous and non-contiguous).
Of course, if you feel that the order of the bundles is not really significant, then I would rather see the list alphabetically sorted.
