Bug 172451 – Missing build.properties file paralyzes PDE tooling
I20070130-0800.
I wanted to use PDE Tools > Organize Manifest...
but it did nothing.
It took a while to notice that I forgot to add a build.properties file and hence  the action did nothing.
From such a cool tool I would expect that it either warns me or generates a build.properites file.
I know, I know I should have used the PDE wizard to create the project in the first place but I started off a normal Java project.
The missing build.properites file also affects the PDE compiler, which no longer creates the problems for some of the MANIFEST.MF sections.
The compiler could add a warning or error on the project if the build.properties is missing and the corresponding 'Problems in build.properties files' is set to warning or error.
