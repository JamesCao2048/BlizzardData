Bug 160043 – RequiredPluginsInitializer should implement getDescription(...)
I20061003
RequiredPluginsInitializer should implement getDescription(...) as this is what is displayed in the Package Explorer (after bug 160005 is fixed) when the initializer fails to create the container (see bug 159989).
