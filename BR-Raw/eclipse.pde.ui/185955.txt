Bug 185955 – Target setting in New Plug-in Project wizard remembers too much
Build: 3.3 M7
1.
Open the New Plug-in Project wizard.
 Note how on the first page of the wizard, the 'Eclipse version' combo value is 3.3 (current target version).
 Good.
 Create a project.
2.
Change the target platform location to point to a 3.0.x build
3.
Repeat #1.
 Note how the Eclipse version combo value is now set to 3.0 (current target value).
 Good.
4.
Change the target platform location back to 3.3 via the Reset button on the Target Platform preference page.
5.
Repeat #1.
 You should now see 3.3 again in the combo box, but you still still 3.0.
 Not good.
