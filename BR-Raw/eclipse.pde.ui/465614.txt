Bug 465614 – Many more fields in Product editor that would need bidi-processing
While reviewing for Bug 465249 , Markus found out out bidi processing for other fields as well
Copy-paste of current bidi issues in product editor
"there are many more fields in Product editor that would need bidi-processing, e.g.
- Configuration > Use and existing config.ini file
- Launching & Branding > all image file fields
- Licensing > URL field
Hint: to make processed fields easy to see, you can go to the Tracing tab in the launch configuration and enable options:
org.eclipse.jface/debug=true
org.eclipse.jface/debug/bidiUtils=true"
