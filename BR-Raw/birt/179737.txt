Bug 179737 The MeasureHandle should be able to provide data type info
We are now allow user input expression as measure expression.
However this brings difficulties in determine the data type of a measure expression evaluation result.
We need MeasureHandle to be enhanced to include the data type info.
Please note that data type "any" is not accepted.
