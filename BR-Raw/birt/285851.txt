Bug 285851 Imprecise tooltip information on pie chart slices in SWT
Build ID: I20090611-1540 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a pie chart. 2. Set category definition to row["PRODUCTLINE"]. 3. Add interactivity to value series: type Mouse Over, action "Show Tooltip", tooltip text: row["PRODUCTLINE"]. The tooltips are displaying appropriate proper categories in Preview tab in Report Designer. Problems occur when the chart is drawn with SwtRendererImpl. Bounding boxes of the slices are used to determine on which slice the mouse is over. More information: I saw the comment: // using rectangle to simulate the arc due to swt limitation. in SwtRendererImpl.enableInteraction(), but I'm really sure what the limitation really is. It seeems more of a limitation of RegionAction class, which is final. I'd imagine a simple solution that a subclass of region action would hold the PathData of an arc, and its contains method would build a Region, load the PathData to that Region, call Region.contains() method and dispose the Region. Not having modifying access to SwtRende
rerImpl, I made a more hackish solution in our RCP application that is drawing BIRT charts, but the principle was the same - store arc PathData & build a Region to ask whether it contains mouse coordinates. This solution precisely determines what pie slice the mouse is currently over.
