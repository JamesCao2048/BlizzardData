Bug 289318 Support cube filter of multiple levels even if they are not used in chart
Currently cube filter only supports for the level which is used in chart binding. If the dimension level is not used, it's not allowed to add filter for the level. The enhancement is to allow to add filter for multiple levels in the same cube dimension hierarchy. For instance, user should be able to bind category as data["quarter"] and add filter data["year"]=2009.
