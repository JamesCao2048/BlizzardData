Bug 276218 Check the theme extended from library if library namespace is changed
Description: For report item extended from library, if the namespace is changed I can find a error message in XML Source that told me parent element xxx.table does not exist. But for theme which is extended from library, if the namespace is changed I can not see the error message like other report item. Build number: 2.5.0.v20090514-0630 Steps to reproduce: 1, New theme in libA.rptlibrary 2, New a report and extend the theme in libA and the namespace of libA.rptlibrary is libA 3, Change namespace of libA to libB Expected result: After step3, I can get a error message which said libA.theme does not exist but not left it as a valid theme, actually it won't work anymore.
