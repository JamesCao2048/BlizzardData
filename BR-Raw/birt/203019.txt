Bug 203019 The drill through in chart builder should only drill through the designfiles in currect project[0005]
Description: Try to define a hyperlink in Chart Area, when browsing the target design files, we can select all the design files from the whole file system. But it is not consistent with the hyperlink's drill through in Property Editor. As a before discussion, we can only drill through the design files in currect project but not all the files in file system. I've no idea that why Chart can drill through the design file from whole file system. So please take a look and whether chart should be consistent with the Property Editor's drill through. Regards!
