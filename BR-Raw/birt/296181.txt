Bug 296181 SQB Data Set Page should not overwrite the Data Set Editor dialog title
The SQL Query Builder dialog embedded in an ODA data set contribution page sets its own dialog title, which overwrites its container dialog. Being a contribution page, it should have preserved the title of its container dialog, i.e. the Data Set Editor.
