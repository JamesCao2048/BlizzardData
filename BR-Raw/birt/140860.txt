Bug 140860 ResourceLocator does not locate externalized strings stored in .properties files
I have been investigating the support to add my custom resource locator to find my externalized properties files and I want to make sure that I will have the right support. I looked at the BIRT code and found that org.eclipse.birt.report.model.core.BundleHelper does not use the IResourceLocator to find the .properties file. Instead it has a "msgFolder" attribute that holds the directory path of the resource files. However this is not going to work for me. I would like the BundleHelper class to make a call to the IResourceLocator to find the .properties files. Could the component owner change this bug to the right component.
