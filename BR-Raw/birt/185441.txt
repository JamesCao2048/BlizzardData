Bug 185441 Possible Javascript error when a server printer has "media size" in inches
This bug concerns server-side printing.
Among standard sheet sizes (a4, a3, ...), some entries like 10"x14" etc.
might appear.
In that case, an incorrect string might be generated by the PrintReportDialogFragment.jsp since double-quotes are not unescaped.
