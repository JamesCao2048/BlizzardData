Bug 146534 ReportEditorInput is not API any more
Hi all, I've posted this on the newsgroup with no feedback. Jason Weathersby advised me to post it here, too. I've just updated from 2.1M5 to RC4 and found that ReportEditorInput isn't API any more. With the changes to M5 it was moved to package org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.editors. This was a good change I think as developers could just inherit and have a java.io.File based implementation of IStorageEditorInput and IPathEditorInput. I did so and deleted my own implementation along with my custom implementation of IStorage. With RC0 ReportEditorInput is in an internal package again. What is the preferred way of dealing with IEditorInput and the BIRT RCP Editor? Will a custom implementation of IStorageEditorInput, IPathEditorInput and IStorage do the job (again)? I came across some code lines like: if ( input instanceof ReportEditorInput ) but, theses seem to be gone with RC4 as well. Maybe a default implementation based on java.io.File (like there was is M5) is a good idea? Mayb
e it's somewhere else now and I can't find it ... Best regards Alex
