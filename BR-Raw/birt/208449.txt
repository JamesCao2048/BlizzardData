Bug 208449 crosstab/chart integration framework
In order to enable charts inside crosstab, some specific logic needs to be written for that particular scenario.
This enhancement aims to
- Design how to add this new logic in a modular way by either creating a new plugin org.eclipse.birt.chart.reportitem.crosstab (needs extension?) or using OO design.
- Implement the framework structure that will contain the business logic to render charts in crosstabs.
