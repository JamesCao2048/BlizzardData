Bug 121269 Allow displaying HTML source for debugging
With the new AJAX-based viewer, one can no longer see the HTML source of the page.
This is extremely inconvenient for debugging engine problems, because there is not an easy way to see the HTML source code.
This might fall into the category an enhancement, but since it significantly reduces other people's work efficiency, I listed its severity as a "major".
