Bug 191089 cross tab Binding tab- Aggregate On field is shows incorrect field name
Cross tab-Binding under properties hows incorrect field for 'Aggregate On'.
It show show similar to regular table binding 'Aggregate On' field.
For example; instead of Location/country it should show either 'N/A' for table or 'Group Country' for any group.
