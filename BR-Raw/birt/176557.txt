Bug 176557 Bubble charts labels not positionned correctly
Create a bubble chart Show the series labels 1- the labels are overlapping the chart, when they are above, below,...
Some bubbles might have the label inside, some outside, depending on their size.
If above is select, the label should be above (and outside) the bubble, regardless of the size.
Same thing for any marker type.
2- We need another choice to show the labels inside the bubble (so it would be centered in the bubble).
