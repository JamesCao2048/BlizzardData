Bug 193259 Enhance about the process of java script and event handler.[08]
Description: Enhance about the conflict of java script and event handler. I have a case, I design a report with script data source and script dataset. Previously I wrote java script for dataset in script view and it works. Then I decided to use event handler to process script dataset, I wrote a java class to extends ScriptedDataSetEventAdapter and overwrite open and fetch methods. As I want to keep the script in script view, I just comment them by /**/. Run the report will throw Exception. I found it's caused by comments in script view. If I deleted them, the report works. I attached the report and java class.
