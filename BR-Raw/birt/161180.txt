Bug 161180 PDF output problem
Birt 2.1.1 PDF emitter seems to have a bug.
It doesn't render floating width table columns correctly.
I have n fixed width columns and one floating column width in my designs.
This column width should be equal to page width
- fixed widths
- margins.
The resulting width in Birt 2.1.1 is 0.Birt 2.1 renders these reports without problems.
