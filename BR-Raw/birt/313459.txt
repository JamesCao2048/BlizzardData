Bug 313459 Problem with % when generating images in tables.
See the attached BirtProject, it has two reports.
Each identical except for this difference: The image width/height is set to a %age value (50%) in one (TestImage.rptdesign) and not-set in the other (TestImageWorking.rptdesign).
TestImage.rptdesign does not display the image in pdf, but works fine in html.
TestImageWorking.rptdesign shows the image in both pdf and html.
The %age setting seems to cause the problem in pdf format.
