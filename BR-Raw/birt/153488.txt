Bug 153488 Page Break - Page breaks are created for groups automatically
In the latest build, engine alyways creats a page break before the outermost group.
Issues: 1) If i add a group with company logo and header, followed by a table (with groups).
The output is confusing, a page break occurs between the grid and table.
A better solution would be page break occurs before each group, except the first group.
Current behavior PageBreakBefore = Always Better solution would be PageBreakBefore = Always but first 2) Looks like engine is automatically putting page breaks for groups.
But when I click on the group definition i see the following values.
PageBreakBefore
- Auto PageBreakAfter
- Auto // Auto means inserts a page break before the element if necesary.
Suggested solution
- When user click on new group dialog, BIRT designer by default sets the value PageBreakBefore = Always but first.
This way it is less confusing to end users.
Cons
- Older reports will not have auto page breaks for groups.
