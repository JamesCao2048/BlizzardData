Bug 201040 Need to specify engine config params when calling reportrunner on command line
Build ID: I20070625-1500 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Run genReport.[bat|sh] and try to use non-default options for engine config. 2. See, couldn't do it, right? 3. Hopefully (2) is right, otherwise I'm going to look pretty foolish. More information: We have a need to be able to specify the resource directory when running reportrunner as part of genReport.bat from the Windows command line. We cannot find a way to do this. The reportrunner java code instantiates a default engineconfig which uses the environment variable BIRT_HOME to set the engine home but we need to configure other things (specifically resource, log and temp dirs as well as log level). I've actually made changes to ReportRunner.java in BIRT 2.2, recompiled and tested but need a more experience body to look over the change and commit it if it's deemed worthy.
