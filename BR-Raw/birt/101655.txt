Bug 101655 Provide the ability to write custom event handlers on chart components.
There is added benefits to provide the ability to add custom event handlers on chart components such as legend items, title bar, axes, data points. This provides for a rich user experience. Consider the following use-case scenario: A line chart is generated with 10 datasets each of these datasets have 100 points. Visually the chart may be cluttered with data. The ability to filter out datasets during runtime can simply the visualization. One solution is to provide an event handler of a legend item. The event handler can be associated with the legend item of a data set to control the visibility of the data set within the plot area. The event is triggered by a "mouse down" event on the legend item. This is just one scenario. Potentially an exploiter of the chart framework can write custom event handlers to provide rich user experience.
