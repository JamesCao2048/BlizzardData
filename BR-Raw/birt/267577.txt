Bug 267577 hasExpression property for Text and TextData
Add an new hasExpression property to <text-data> and <text> to indicate if there is an expression in the text value of text-data that needs engine to parse the text data strings. Need UI to allow user to set this property on a text-data and text, and need engine to check this property before parsing the string. For backward compatibility, old version of design treat hasExpression=true.
