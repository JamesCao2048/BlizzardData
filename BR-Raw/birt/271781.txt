Bug 271781 Image in header on master page causes extra line for Word Emitter
From the newsgroup: In my .rptdesign, I have a master page with a standard header - a grid with 3 cells. The 3 cells have a background color and the 3rd cell contains a right aligned image. When I generate the PDF, all is fine, the header looks like a solid block of color with the image on the right hand side so it looks like - XXX XXX IMAGE But when I generate the Word document and look at the Header, there appears to be an extra blank line or return character in the 3rd cell after the image, which means I get an extra line of color at the bottom of the header so it roughly looks like- XXX XXX IMAGE XXX XXX XXX Atttached is a report with only data on the master page that shows the issue. If I add a dummy label in the third cell with the image and set both the image and the label style to text block inline, the issue does not happen. Jason
