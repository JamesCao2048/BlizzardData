Bug 276663 Query result is affected when computed column order changes
Check the attached report design, there're four computed columns defined in the data set.
If column["datetime"] is defined as the first column, then the data result is ok (check the preview result page in data set editor).
If move column["datetime"] to the last, then column["date"], column["time"] returns the empty values, while column["time_agg"] still returns the correct result.
It seems the order of the computed column definitions will affect the query processing.
If this is unexpected, we need fix it, otherwise it's better to throw a runtime exception to notify this situation, currently it fails silently.
