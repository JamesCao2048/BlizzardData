Bug 188204 After delete the measure in cube, the measure's binding in crosstab are not deleted automatically[1102]
Description: Firstly, we should make sure the measure has been used in crosstab, and we removed the measure from crosstab, then remove it from cube. Because of the measure has been used in crosstab, so the binding of measure are still in crosstab whether the measure has been removed from crosstab. But, if remove the measure from the cube, the binding are still in crosstab, it will lead the "can not found the measure" exception when preview. The user must remove the binding by himself to make sure the preview successfully. So I hope GUI can make some enhance when remove the measure from cube, all the measure's binding of crosstab also removed automatically. Build number: 2.2.0.v20070522-0630 Steps to reproduce: 1, New a crosstab with two measures: m1 and m2 2, Remove the m1 from crosstab 3, Preview 4, Remove the m1 from cube 5, Preview Expected result: After step4, all the m1's binding in crosstab has been removed and after step5, the preview is successful Actual result: After step4, al
l the m1's binding are still in crosstab's databinding, and after step5, exception occurs. Error log: The measure name "QUANTITYORDERED" is not found. The measure name "QUANTITYORDERED" is not found.
