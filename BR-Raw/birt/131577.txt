Bug 131577 Script Access to Factory/Presentation Mode
There is no easy way from within BIRT scripting to access whether a report is in factoryMode or presentationMode. The ExecutionContext object on the ReportContextImpl class has this information, but it is not available through scripting. I wonder if it makes sense to just expose the ExecutionContext and let the developer get the ExecutionContext or work from there, or if it is better to maintain an abstraction layer off of the ExecutionContext with all of the functionality wrapped off. To me it is more useful to divide the script functions into some that are basic and fully supported and others that are in the category of Kung-Fu scripting where the developer has to have a relatively high level of experience. So if we decide this is a basic function, we expose the factory mode in the IReportContext interface. If it is deemed to be Kung-Fu scripting, then we just expose a handle to the ExecutionContext and let developers figure it themselves. Thoughts?
