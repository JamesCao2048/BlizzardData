Bug 203888 Syntax Checker for JavaScript
BIRT provides the report developer the ability to use JavaScript to build custom logic in reports.
Report developers currently do not have the ability to validate JavaScript code during design.
JavaScript errors are only caught at runtime.
This project looks at providing report developers the ability to validate JavaScript code at design time.
The benefits of doing so are increased report developer productivity since errors can be caught and corrected at design time instead of at runtime.
