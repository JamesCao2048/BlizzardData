Bug 119792 Preview the current selected report automtically in BIRT debugger workbench
With M3 build, after the debugger is launched, the user has to manually select the report design, and preview the report. In most cases, people expect the debugger will open the current selected report design file, and preview the report automatically. This is similar to debug a java application, the java debugger will use the main() as the entry point in the current project, start execute it. If the current selected file is not a report design, it should behave as it does now.
