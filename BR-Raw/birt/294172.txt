Bug 294172 Use the newly created data set directly in chart builder.[13]
description: When user choose to new a data set in chart builder, he tends to use it.
So after the data set is created, it should be selected directly.
This is also the behavior in dynamic parameter.
Now we still use
<None> after a new data set is created.
Hope this could be improved.
