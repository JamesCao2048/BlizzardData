Bug 203680 Birt Designer "date" and "time" filter doesn't work properly
Comment from Gauri 1. the filter for date and time in designer doesnt work correctly. I tried to filter on any date column having time NOT equal to 12:00:00. On the UI, the date is shown as say Sept. 4, 1995, but internally actual date value has time 2:45 am. Now if I try to apply a filter say <expression name="expr">row["Column Binding"]</expression> <simple-property-list name="value1"> <value>"1995-09-04"</value> </simple-property-list> filter returns blank resultset. So the time value is not getting ignored. Similarly filter on another time column like given below also doesnt work. <expression name="expr">row["Column Binding1"]</expression> <simple-property-list name="value1"> <value>"14:00:00"</value> </simple-property-list> 2. Open DateAndTimeReport.rptdesign and apply filter on "date-time" column having time Not equal to 12:00:00 also doesnt work. Needs engine side investigation on this.
