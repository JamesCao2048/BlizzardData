Bug 191996 'Edit Data Set' dialog doesn't remember location and setup when it's closed.
Build ID: I20060602-1317 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Double click an existing MySQL Data Set from the 'Data Sets' item, found in the 'Data Explorer'. 2. Move the 'Edit Data Set' dialog to a new location. 3. Change the positions of the vertical splits between the option selection tree, database table tree and the data set SQL statement. 4. Hit the OK button. 5. Double click the same Data Set selected during step 1. The position of the dialog and splits have been lost. More information: The Edit Data Set dialog for MySQL queries doesn't remember: 1) it's location on the screen, 2) the position of the vertical split between the Area selection tree, the database table tree and the data set selection SQL statement. As a result, when refining a large SQL statement, the user is needs to resizing the edit dialog everytime the Data Set is opened. It would be better if the dialog restored its previous location and split positions.
