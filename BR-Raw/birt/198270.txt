Bug 198270 Copying an aggregate does not make a copy, only a reference
In a table with groups or multiple columns, create an aggregate in a footer or a header.
Copy the aggregate to another cell in a footer or a header.
Make changes to the new aggregate appropriate to its new location.
Expected result: The changes appear in only the new copy of the aggregate.
Actual result: The changes appear in both aggregates because the new aggregate is not a copy, but a reference to the same aggregate as the original.
