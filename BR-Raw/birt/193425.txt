Bug 193425 Content Sensitive Help does not automatically display on selecting a Data Editor page node
In BIRT Data Source/Set Editor, pressing the ? (Help) icon at any page node opens the tray, but no related About content is displayed. One has to first move the focus to within a page control, then pressing the Help icon brings up the related About content. The expected behavior, as found in platform PropertyDialog, is to automatically update and refresh the related About content by simply selecting a page node.
