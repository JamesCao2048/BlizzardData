Bug 223759 BIRT color chooser opens far from property editor
Open a BIRT report. Select a label. Open the property editor. Click on the background color chooser button. The chooser opens, but it is way up near the upper left corner of the screen. The button I clicked was down by the bottom right corner. Thus, I need to first find the chooser, then move my mouse way across the screen and back. Move the color chooser closer to the property editor. Choose a color and press OK. Press the color chooser button again. The chooser is back to its original location. Expected that the chooser would open right near the button, the way a context menu or Java variable browser window does. This will minimize hand motion when choosing a color. Also, if the chooser location is to be independent of where the chooser button is clicked, expected the chooser to remember its location so I can move it manually to a convenient location.
