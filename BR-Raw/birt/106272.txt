Bug 106272 Chart Selector dialog incorrectly parented
Eclipse 3.1, GEF 3.1, EMO-SDO-SDK 2.1.0, BIRT 1.0.1 GTK+ 2.6.8 (Debian Linux) In the report editor, click on "chart" in the palette and click back on the layout to add a chart. This opens a "Chart Selector" dialog. However, while the dialog is modal, it does not seem to have the Eclipse window as its parent. Under Linux, this gives some interesting effects. Even though the dialog is modal, you can minimize it and move the Eclipse window in front of it, which can be quite confusing. The dialog should be created with a parent.
