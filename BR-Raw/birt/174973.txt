Bug 174973 Master page "n of m" page count misaligned in PDF output
The second number in the "n of m" is not aligned vertically with the other elements in the grid.
The numbers were aligned in 2.1.1, but are misaligned in 2.1.2 and in BIRT 2.2M4.To reproduce:
- Open enclosed report and generate PDF or
- Create new report
- modify Master page by adding n of m page count
- shrink column width of grid to .15 in for each column so the elements are closer together (makes alignment problem noticeable)
