Bug 125678 The original chart instance in report design handle is not modified after running the report.
The original chart instance in report design handle is not modified after running the report. In my application, I get the design time instance of chart, and then I call method which runs the report. I expect chart bound with data after running the report. The same functionality was working fine (I mean: BIRT was returning chart bound with data after running report) till BIRT2.0M3. It's not working as expected in BIRT RC and 2.0 version.
