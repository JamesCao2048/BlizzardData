Bug 218780 [PDF] Text justification problems
Hi, First of all, sorry for my poor english.
I have a grid with two columns and two lines.
In each cell, i have a long text.
I have used "Text" components to display thoses texts.
Texts are HTML content.
I have set the alignment to "justify".
Nevertheless, texts aren't good justified ! In fact, sometines somes "spaces" characters begin lines and end of lines aren't aligned.
Is this a normal or is this a bug ?
