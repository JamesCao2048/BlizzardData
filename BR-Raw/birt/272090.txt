Bug 272090 Select Data displays the data cube when a chart uses data from a cross tab
1. Create a cross tab, and provide a name for it. 2. Create a chart. 3. In Select Data, select Use Data from, then select the cross tab. The chart builder displays the data cube, and instructs the user to "Right click or drag the levels to Category Series or optional Y Series, Measure to Value Series." These actions, however, are not supported. To select data for the chart, you must select a column binding from the Value Series drop-down list. The chart builder then fills in the appropriate data for the Category Series and Optional Y Series Grouping. Instead of showing the cube data, the chart builder should either: Show the cross tab data and let the user drag items from there or Maintain the current action of selecting a binding from the Value Series list AND change the instructions to the user.
