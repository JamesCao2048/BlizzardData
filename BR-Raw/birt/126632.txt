Bug 126632 Template label does not have id attribute in html output.
Overview Description: Template label with a value defined is not given an "id" attribute in html output.
The attached report (label.rptdesign) has a template label with the text "Template Label Text".
When the report is shown in the preview pane, the div tag containing the label text does not have an id attribute.
In contrast, the table tag has an id attribute with a unique id.
Steps to reproduce: Open attached report label.rptdesign.
Select "preview" tab.
View source for the resulting html page.
Actual results: div tag containing label text does not have an id attribute.
Expected results: div tag contaiing label text has a unique id attribute.
