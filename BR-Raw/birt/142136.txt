Bug 142136 [Performance improvements] Optimize storing data into report document
Presently DtE will store all binding column data into report document for each row, but it will also store some unnecessary data such as the aggregation value of one group. Because the aggregation value will be changed when moving the group, not moving on row, such kind of data need not be stored on each row.
