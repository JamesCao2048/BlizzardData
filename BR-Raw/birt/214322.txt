Bug 214322 Enhance BIRT COUNT aggregation function.
Current BIRT COUNT aggregation function takes no argument, this makes the function a mimic of SQL COUNT(*). However it still cannot cover COUNT(columnName) usage of SQL count. This enhancement targets to add an optional argument to BIRT COUNT. In case that an argument is provided we will have a complete mimic of SQL COUNT(columnName), otherwise we stick to current behavior.
