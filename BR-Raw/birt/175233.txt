Bug 175233 Request to change access specifier of the org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.editors.MultiPageReportEditor.updateRelatedViews() method from private to protected or public
Hi, We are extending the BIRT Designer to add support for the versioning system in our project.
Our requirement is as follows: 1.User creates a new BIRT report and saves it 2.First time when the report is created its version is 1.3.Any subsequent save creates a new version 4.The version is always included in the filename.
5.Once a new version is created, we are able to display its new name(with the new version number) on the editor tab.
But we are unable to update the name on the "Outline" view where the Data sources and Data sets are displayed.
6.For this sake we have extended org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.editors.MultiPageReportEditor and overridden the public void doSave(IProgressMonitor progressMonitor) method.
7.In order to display the new name on the "Outline" view, we need to call org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.editors.MultiPageReportEditor.updateRelatedViews() method but its private.
If we decide to copy this method then we need to replicate the following methods from org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.editors.MultiPageReportEditor: updateOutLineView(),getOutlinePage(), dispose(), getAdapter(), updateRelatedViews(), pageChange(), getPalettePage(), updatePaletteView(), updateDateView(), getDataPage() Apart from this we will require to even copy the class org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.internal.ui.editors.schematic.ReportMultiBookPage as this class is not exposed for use for other plugins.
To avoid so much code replication we request you to change the access specifier of the org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.editors.MultiPageReportEditor.updateRelatedViews() method from private to protected or public
