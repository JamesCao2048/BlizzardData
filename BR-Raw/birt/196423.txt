Bug 196423 Wrong behaviour of Page break inside a row
Build ID: 3.3 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Create a report which will be generated in a PDF format.
2.Insert a table with 2 columns.
3.Insert a new Grid for each cell of the row.
4.Insert a short text in the first grid.
5.Insert a long text in the second grid.
If there is a page break generated by the second grid (which contain the long text), the whole row will be inserted in the page after but the the second grid will be under the first (and not aligned to the right).
More information: Look the 'Upper.png' image, my tables are divided in 3 parts.
Notice the white space between the green line and the page numbers.
In the second Image ('bugged.png') you can see the bug: the first 2 grids (light blue and green) are correctly aligned but not the third one, I think the reason is that the first 2 grids stays in the white space of the page before, but not the third grid.
I don't know why at page break the third is not aligned with the rest.
