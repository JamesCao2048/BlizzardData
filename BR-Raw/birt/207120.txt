Bug 207120 Please model provide an API for data type conversion.
Currently, there're two data types: column data type and parameter data type.
But they're inconsistent.
Could model provide APIs for conversion between the two types.
Thanks.
In addition: please check the code into head and 2.2.1 branch, because we have a 2.2.1 bug to fix.
