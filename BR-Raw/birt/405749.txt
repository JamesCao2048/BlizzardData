Bug 405749 Typo in variable name: linkToSalarParameter
In the class org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.data.ui.dataset.DataSetParametersPage.ParameterInputDialog, the field linkToSalarParameter appears to have a typo in it's name. "Salar" isn't a word (AFIAK) -- presumably what was meant was "linkToScalarParameter". It's a very minor issue, but I thought it worth tossing into a bug report so it won't get forgotten.
