Bug 162281 Better parsing of BIRT_VIEWER_LOG_LEVEL parameter
java.util.logging.Level supplies a parse(String) method which parses log levels. Using this method is superior to the parsing used in ReportEngineServlet for the following reasons: - the level "ALL" is not recognized - one gets a proper exception if the level ins not recognized - a lot less code. I'll attach a patch for this.
