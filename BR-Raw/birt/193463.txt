Bug 193463 Standalone chart builder should provide a dialog to input URL hyperlink
Since URL hyperlink in Interactivity is common functionality which is not related to BIRT report, not like hyperlink to Bookmark or Drill Throught, standalone chart builder should provide a dialog to input URL hyperlink. This dialog can be simple to input URL only in standalone chart builder. But if integrated in BIRT, this dialog can provide inputing URL/Bookmark/DrillThrough as before.
