Bug 209154 Enhance Report Model to support view property
The goal of this enhancement is to support a chart view property on crosstab or table report items. The view should follow the several rules: - The view automatically shares its binding with the host item, they can't be modified. - The view can be retrieved through the API only by querying it from the host item, through a getView() method. It is not accessible directly by id - A property should be available to control whether the host or view should be displayed (default is host item). If possible, this should be controllable using report parameters. - The model should return the visibile view to the report engine to ensure that there is no impact on engine code to support this new view. - The host/view combination is a single report item with a unique id Since the chart is an extended item, the model can provide additional properties to indicate which item can be view, and which item can be a host. For 2.3, only table and crosstab can be hosts, and only chart can be a view.
