Bug 217640 XML driver ISO date format parsing problem.
In XML driver, when parse date(yyyy-mm-dd) from a string with ISO 8601 format and negative GMT info, problem will occur.
A sample string could be: 1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00 This is caused by cleanDate(String) method in DateFormatISO8601 class.
The last "-" has not been cleaned correctly.
This problem also exists in flat file driver.
