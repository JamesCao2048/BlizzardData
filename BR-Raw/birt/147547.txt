Bug 147547 Eclipse appears to hang for a short period when previewing report
Open a report design in BIRT report designer.
Click on "Preview" pane of the report view to preview the report.
Very often it will take quite a few seconds before the designer actually switch to that pane (on my machine it could take up to 10 seconds).
During this period the entire Eclipse hangs and does not respond to any keyboard or mouse events.
This always leaves me wondering if I had missed the tab on the click, and had to click again to make sure.
This is not user friendly.
If we can't switch to the Preview pane in a timely manner at least display a busy mouse pointer to let the user know that his click is being processed.
This issue is most noticeable when you run report for the first time after starting eclipse.
