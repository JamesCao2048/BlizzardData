Bug 193653 Can't add Aggregation Element to Grid in Crosstab Summary Cell
Build ID: I20070608-1718 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a crosstab and add levels and dimensions. 2. Turn on a total/summary cell. 3. Add a grid element from the palette. 4. Try to drag & drop an aggregation element into that grid. More information: The UI will prevents me from doing this, although, I can successfully edit the XML source code to do this. This was working in 2.2RC3. This is no longer possible in my nightly build from 6/20. This is needed to add multiple aggregations like (min, max, average) to a summary cell. Thanks
