Bug 205930 2.2.2 Cube Builder: Dragging a dimension from cube builder should show all the associated levels.
The current behavior is that user drags the data field from the cube and to show the hierarchy, he has to click on Show/Hide columns and select the underlying field. Proposed Solution: When the user selects the Product Line as group. Product Name is the underlying field. When user drags the Product Line field from the cube, Product Name should also follow through. If user does not want to show the Product Name, he can choose to hide it from show/hide group levels. User should also be able to add levels from the Data Cube in Data Explorer by dragging them to the cross tab.
