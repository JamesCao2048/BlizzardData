Bug 305117 [Accessibility] Can not switch from 'Available Items' to query text area directly.[17]
description: When we are writing the query text, we select from the 'Available Items' or enter text directly. So it should be more convenient if we can switch between directly. build id: 2.6.0 v20100309-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. Open a data set. 2. Try to switch from 'Available Items' to query text area by keyboard. Actual result: Can not switch directly. You have to go through the dialog.
