Bug 179395 Report viewer fails when installed via Update Manager/Callisto
The good news: I'm getting consistent behavior between the BIRT designer in the IDE and the BIRT runtime in my application.
What I'm stuck on now: Background: I got BIRT through the Callisto update site.
I've used JDBC to produce a simple BIRT report off of one table.
In the BIRT designer, if I click the "preview" tab (equivalent to calling /run, I think), everything works.
Similarly, if I choose "view report as HTML" on the toolbar, this works.
However, choosing "View Report in Web Viewer" on the tool bar results in my report running, but no data appearing.
I see my title table, the header band, and the date/time the report was run in the footer, but no data in between.
Also, choosing "View Report as PDF" on the tool bar results in the following error message in the popup browser window: org.eclipse.birt.report.service.api.ReportServiceException: Report engine fails to create extension to handle this request.
I get exactly the same behavior in my application.
Hopefully, if I can get BIRT to run properly in the IDE, I can get it to run properly in my application.
