Bug 137832 Need expression builder in Edit Parameter dialog
Use case: I want to a dynamic parameter for the order numbers that a user can select.
However, I want to make it easy for the user to verify who the customer is that placed that order.
I would therefore like to display: "10100
-- Land Toys Inc" The value column could be just the order number.
Right now if I want to accomplish this, I have to do the concatenation of order number and customer name in the data set sql statement.
This is ok if the data source supports this.
If my data source does not then I need the expression builder for this.
In addition, I would like the expression builder available for the value column as well.
That will allow me to do some preprocessing before passing the value on to the data set.
The workaround is that I have to directly edit the XML source to add the Javascript expression in the parameters section.
It would be nice to have this as part of the GUI.
