Bug 152948 Print as pdf not working for bar chart having Y-Series interactivity.
In BIRT2.1 release, a bar chart having a drill-through set on its Y-Series when rendered works fine, but on clicking the print as pdf option, produces a blank page. In the same report, if the drill-through is set on the chart area interactivity, everything including the print as pdf option works fine.
