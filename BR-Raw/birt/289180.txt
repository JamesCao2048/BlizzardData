Bug 289180 Support internationalization of report title
Environment: - BIRT 2.5 - XP - JBoss 4.2.2 While BIRT supports internationalization of text in a report the report title does not. I found entries in the report designer for the report properties under the advanced section - the last entries are "Title" and "Title key" but title key does not have any affect. "Title key" does not seem to be used correctly.
