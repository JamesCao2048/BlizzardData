Bug 130946 Switch to ICU collator class in JdbcDriverManagerDialog
Class org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.ui.JdbcDriverManagerDialog uses java.text.Collator.
This should be converted to using ICU4J (icu.text.Collator).
Since the ICU classes are somewhat different some code rewrite is needed in this class.
