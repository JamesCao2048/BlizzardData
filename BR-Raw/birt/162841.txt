Bug 162841 [regression]Drill-through link to document containing parameters failed in html and pdf
Description: Drill-through link to document containing parameters failed in html and pdf Steps to reproduce: 1. New a report with a report parameter, don't set default value for it. 2. Preview in Web Viewer, input parameter value and save the report document to c: 3. New another report, insert a label, set a drill through link on the label, link to the report document. 4. Preview in web viewer, html and pdf, click the link. Expected result: Link to target report. Actual result: In html, a dialog popped up and said "a runtime error has occurred" In pdf, a dialog popped up and said that report parameter has null value. In frameset servlet, both formats are ok. I found that if I set default value for the report parameter in target report, the issue will disappear.
