Bug 324546 external .js file has no effect in beforeOpen if the data set is used to generate a dynamic parameter selection
Build Identifier: I define a function "replace_query" in an external .js file, and then include it in the report. I then use the function in the beforeOpen script. If the data set is not used to generate a dynamic parameter selection, then it works fine. Otherwise, when viewing the report, it will give this error: Error evaluating Javascript expression. Script engine error: ReferenceError: "replace_query" is not defined. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Define a function in an external .js file 2. Include the .js file in the report 3. Call the function in the beforeOpen script of a data set that is also used to generate a dynamic parameter selection
