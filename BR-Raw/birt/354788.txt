Bug 354788 Visibility not working properly with crosstab horizontal page break
Build Identifier: birt-rcp-report-designer-2_6_1 In my report, I have a cross tab with column area page break given with Interval 2 for product line as shown in image pagebreak.bmp.
In master page, i have a grid in header section with an image.
The visibility of image is controlled based on on data set field as follows: When HEADER_TYPE = 1, hide image Else show image.
Now, when I generate the report in pdf, page break is happening for horizontal interval 2 as expected.
But, for the next set of product lines, the image is not getting hidden.
Please find the attached zip file with the sample rptdesign and output pdf.
Please help me to fix this issue.
Reproducible: Always
