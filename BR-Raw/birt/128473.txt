Bug 128473 Report property stamped with wrong BIRT version
Report object types that are newly available in BIRT designer 2.0, ie *.rpttemplate, get identified in the Property editor as having been created by BIRT 2.0 when a new ojbect is created in a project .
Report object types that were already available from BIRT designers 1.0.1, i.e., *.rptdesign get stamped as having been created by BIRT Designer Version 1.0.1, even though 2.0 is the currently installed version on the machine.
