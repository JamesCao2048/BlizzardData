Bug 116786 Library include should store relative path.
When a library included in a report design, the BIRT designer should generate the relative path, and save relative path. Example - $project/test contains my report design. - now include a library from $project/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary. - i see that hte report design stores absolute path, we need to save relative path. <property name="fileName">/E:/birt/sampleReports/otherlib/lib1.rptlibrary</property> <property name="namespace">lib1</property>
