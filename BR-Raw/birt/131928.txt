Bug 131928 tabs in the sql editor for a dataset break the syntax highlighting for the next keyword
if you type in the query like this (where
<tab> is a press of the tab key) select name from user
<tab>inner join address on address.user_id = user.id the syntax highlighting does not apply the correct colour to the word "inner" if you change the
<tab> to a space the colour is displayed correctly.
