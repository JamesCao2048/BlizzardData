Bug 192799 Keep value column combo consistent with expression builder button for dynamic parameter definition
When defining a dynamic parameter, if none of the value column contains values of the selected data type, the value combo chooser is disabled. At this time, the expression builder button next to it should be disabled, too. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a sample datasource and dataset with "select * from CLASSICMODELS.ORDERS". 2. Create a boolean report parameter, combo box, dynamic. Expected result: value column combo and expression builder button are both disabled. Actual result: only value column combo chooser is disabled.
