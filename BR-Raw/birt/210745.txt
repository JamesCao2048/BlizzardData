Bug 210745 BIRT does not show SYSTEM tables
Currenty BIRT does not show the SYSTEM tables from a JDBC connection. The class org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.ui.editors.SQLDataSetEditorPage excludes the SYSTEM TABLES. However, we would like to include the SYSTEM TABLES in our environment. Therefore we would like to have this in a next release.
