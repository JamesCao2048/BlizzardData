Bug 121418 Error enlarging a chart in ReportDesigner
Trying to resize a Chart (no much actually) in the report Designer results in the following behaviour: The chart disappears from the page, but is still visible in the outline. There the chart gets assigned a very hugh number in the width/height properties (540625in/18020833333333332in) or (15854166666666666in/3171875in) or various other very big numbers. Trying to change this, does not really result in an improvement. It is possible to reproduce this and it is never again possible to change the size of the chart. Rebuilding the report is the only possibility to get out.
