description: Can not use non-numeric data to render value series even if the aggregation is COUNT.
build id: 2.6.0 v20100402-0630 steps to reproduce: 1.New data set with table payments in sample db.
2.Insert a pie chart, using the data set.
3.Select payment data as category.
4.Select checknumber as value series.See the error message in chart builder.
5.Change the aggregation from sum to count in Grouping and sorting dialog.
