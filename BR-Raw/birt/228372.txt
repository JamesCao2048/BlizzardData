Bug 228372 Add "reset size" action for Image item
Add a "reset size" action for Image item only in context menu of layout editor.
The action label reads "Reset to Original Size".
This action simply clears the width and height property of current image item so it will display as original size.
This action should be positioned between "Edit" and "Create Template report item...".
