Bug 416105 Docx output: leading and trailing whitespaces of a label are removed
I have two simple labels in my report. The first label has my given name as value with a space at the end "Martin ". The second labels value is my lastname "Burgler". If I generate the report as docx output the whitespace is removed. I get as result "MartinBurgler". If I use pdf or doc as output format the result is as expected "Martin Burgler".
