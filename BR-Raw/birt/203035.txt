Bug 203035 Timezones not supported
Build ID: 3.3.0 Reportengine: 2.2.0 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a report with a sql statement like this: select system_id, created_on from data_table where created_on > ? and created_on < ? The two parameters are parameters, which must be entered by the user. 2. Run the report with the runtime engine. More information: The runtime engine is embeded into my application. The user can be in different timezones. When a user enteres "11/11/06 11:11" and is in e.g. Tokio, its something different else if a user enters "11/11/06 11:11" and is in London. The 2 users expect different results. How can i set the timezone of the report-engine? Is it possible to set the timezone with runtime-engine? In my eyes it is not possible. The birt-runtime-engine always takes the default timezone of the Java Runtime Engine (TimeZone.getDefault()). I tried to ask this in the newsgroup, but nobody answered. If there is no possibility to set the timezone, this seems to be a "blocker" bug and should be fixed in
the next release. Thx Orkus
