Bug 187639 Tooltips for invisible series in svg chart still there
I have a chart with tooltips (onMouseOver) on the data points of a series When I toggle the visibility for the series, the series vanishes But when I hover over the invisible data point, the tooltip appears. Steps to reproduce: -Create a report with SVG chart with a value series. -For interactivity set: -"Show tooltip" in the "OnMouseOver" event of the series -"Toggle visibility" in "OnClick" of the legend -Run the report, keep position of a data point of a series in mind and -toggle that series to invisible. -Hover mouse over remembered data point position --> the tooltip appears
