Bug 127005 Dynamic drill thru link to book mark
To create a drill thru link to a report document, user has to pre-create book marks in the target report today.
But in many cases, the target report could be designed by a different report writer.
And that report writer may not know what section of the report others want to link to.
We shall not require the target report has pre-created book mark for other reports to link to it.
We shall allow link to a report's TOC, and allow link to report based on report item ID + row id (col name, col value) For BIRT 2.1, we only need to add support of drill thru link to tarket report's TOC.
