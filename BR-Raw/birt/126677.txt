Bug 126677 Improper handling with importing CSS file which contains underscore in selector
When trying to import a CSS file in BIRT report designer 2.0 which contains underscore in selector, e.g: table_Footer_Row { background-color: #000099; color: #FFFFFF; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-weight: bold; } BIRT just ignores this style without poping up any message, thus my question is does BIRT supports the selector with underscore?
Thanks!
