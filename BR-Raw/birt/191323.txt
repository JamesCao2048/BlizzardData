Bug 191323 Cannot set cross tab column width less than data item width.
Steps - Create a cross tab item - DnD some dimensions to row/column area and define measures. - Now try to resize the column width of the cross tab. Current behavior - I cannot change column width lesser than the report item width ( data item, label width, image, text or any other report item ) Expected behavior - I should be able to set the cross tab column widht to whatever size i want and this should not be controlled by report item widht. There is no easy way to set the column width.
