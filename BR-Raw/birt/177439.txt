Bug 177439 Need an easy way to determine default value for a dynamic parameter
Currently, I have to bring up the data set editor, preview the results in the data set and make a mental note of the value to use for a report parameter that depends on a data set.
It would be nice to have a drop down on the default value field, such as
<Select value> which when selected queries the data set and presents me with a list to select from.
