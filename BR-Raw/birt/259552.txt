Bug 259552 Pb with text-indent in dynamic text
I upgraded recently from 2.2.2 to 2.3.1. The text-indent worked well in 2.2.2 It seems that there is a regression bug in 2.3.1: the beginning of the first line is well shifted, but the end of this line is truncated. I use the PDF renderer for the printing.
