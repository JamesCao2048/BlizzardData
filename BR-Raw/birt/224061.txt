Bug 224061 Fail to set calculated number from date as series for difference chart[13]
Description: Fail to set calculated number from date value as series for difference chart Build number:2.3.0.v20080326 Steps to reproduce: 1. New sample dataset from ORDERS. 2. New a chart, select difference type. 3. I try to use the chart to display difference between SHIPDATE AND REQUIREDATE, so I input row["SHIPDATE"].getDay() in series through Expression Builder. 4. Define other category and attributes for chart. Expected result: This kind of chart can be created and preview. Actual result: In step3, errors are shown to indicate the series value type isn't accepted but it's number actually. Then the series definition will be cleaned when I define some other attributes in chart. Error log:n/a
