Bug 208872 Provide new Crosstab model APIs for chart support
The goal of this enhancement is to support charts inside crosstab measure cells.
Charts will span accross an entire row or column, and therefore the crosstab model should provide some API to:
- merge all cells on rows, or on columns.
This needs integration with report engine to get the merged subquery for all the cells.
- insert a header/footer row or column for custom content (in this case, the chart will render the axis there)
- allow to set a fixed dimension for the width/height of the base measure cell (charts cannot expand/shrink dynamically, so the size must be set at design time)
