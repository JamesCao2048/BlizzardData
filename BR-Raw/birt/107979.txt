Bug 107979 It is not possible to use Birt 1.0.1 with IBM DB2 7.x
It is not possible to use Birt (version 1.0.1) with DB2 7.2 with FixPack 14 (I have spent a lot of time by trying whatever I could). The best I achieved in some cases was a succesfull test of connection, but I was never able to access the real data. At first I used JDBC drivers provided in db2java.zip in the installation. a)Driver: COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver (v7.1) ----------------------------------------------------------- Database URL: jdbc:db2://localhost/km330b Name: xxxxx Password: xxxxxxx Test connection fails: Cannot create instance of JDBC driver class [COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver] b)Driver: COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.net.DB2Driver (v7.1) ----------------------------------------------- Database URL: jdbc:db2://localhost/km330b Name: xxxxx Password: xxxxxxx Test connection: ok. Then I wanted to create a data set. At first it looks ok (the Birt found out the tables available in db.), but regardless of what kind of SQL I write, it does not work: Cannot get the string value from colum
n(1). Cannot get String value in result set CLI0610E Invalid column number. SQLSTATE=S1002 Reason: A Birt exception occurred c) Ok, I gave up on native JDBC drivers and tried JdbcOdbcDriver Driver: sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver (Sun JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver) Database URL: jdbc:odbc:km330b Name: xxxx Pasword: xxxx km330b is the name of the ODBC data source and also the name of DB2 database I want to access, Test connection: ok Dataset: tables are not shown in "Available items". When writing any SQL and using Preview results, there is this error: Cannot get the result set metadata. SQL statement does not return a ResultSet object [IBM][CLI Driver] CLI0125E Function sequence error. SQLSTATE=S1010 Reason: A Birt error occurred. Does anyone knows how to use Birt with DB2 7.x? My bosses decided to replace Crystal Reports by Birt, so it is quite important for me...
