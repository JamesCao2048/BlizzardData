Bug 159445 BIRT ignores OSGi system properties
Configuring the OSGi framework by setting osgi.configuration.area or osgi.instance.area system property has no effect.
The OSGILauncher in org.eclipse.birt.core overwrites any settings for the above system properties.
The OSGILauncher should check whether the system properties are already set and use these settings.
The OSGi system properties are described in the eclipse runtime options as being specific for the OSGi framework.
These system properties are needed, e.g.
to create a read-only installation.
