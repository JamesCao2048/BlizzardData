Bug 115940 Unclear "LIKE" operator pattern syntax
The "LIKE" operator used to build BIRT filters (for data sets and tables) does not accept SQL patterns, and there is no documentation on what syntax it uses.
To fix this and to provide a way to do simply filtering, (1) We need a simple SQL-like pattern matching capability since its earlier to use and satisfies perhaps 90% of search requirements.
We should therefore modify the operator LIKE to accept the least common denominator of various RDBMS implementation of this operator: the pattern uses % to match 0 or more of any characters, _ to match exactly one character, and  as escape character.
All other characters are matched case-sensitively.
(2) Use Javascript syntax (which is Perl-like) for complex regular expression matching.
We should introduce a new operator, MATCH, whose right operand is a regular expression as defined in the EMCAScript Specification.
