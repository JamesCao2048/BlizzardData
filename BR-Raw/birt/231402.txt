Bug 231402 Model Adapter not updating data set parameter name to reflect changes in ODA parameter definitions
Steps to reproduce: 1, New a datasource FROM "BIRT Classic Models Sample Database" Connection profile 2, New a dataset based on the datasource 3, Specify the query text in the SQB source panel: SELECT * FROM CLASSICMODELS.OFFICES WHERE STATE LIKE ?
AND CITY LIKE :mycity 4, Finish 5, Reopen the Data Set Editor and check the Parameters page it shows 2 parameters as expected, the first one named "param_1" and second one named "mycity" 6, Go to the Query page, and modify the query text in the SQB source pane to: SELECT * FROM CLASSICMODELS.OFFICES WHERE STATE LIKE :mystate AND CITY LIKE :mycity 7, Go to Parameters page It still shows the same 2 parameters from step 5.Expected result: The first parameter "param_1" should have been replaced by a new parameter (in position 1) with the name "mystate", as defined in the ODA response's parameter definition.
