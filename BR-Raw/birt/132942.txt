Bug 132942 Create adaptor plugin for Data Engine to support BIRT requests
BIRT Data Engine is not designed to be dependent on the birt.model plugin (in order to promote reuse of this component).
This has necessitated the class org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.adaptor.ModelDteApiAdaptor in order for BIRT components to issue BIRT model-based requests.
This class currently reside in the Engine plugin.
Going forward we should introduce a new plugin to act as an adaptor of DtE for use with BIRT.
This plugin will introduce a BIRT data engine adaptor API which will allow BIRT ROM objects to be directly given as parameters for data requests, thereby obsoleting the need for the ModelDteApiAdaptor class.
Some features of the DataSetManager class (currently in designer.ui) can also be moved into this new adaptor plugin.
