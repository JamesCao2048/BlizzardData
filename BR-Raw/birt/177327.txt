Bug 177327 Support more than eight colors in the Palette
if we use the update(int) method in Palette we only get 8 different colors.
This is very inconvenient as this implies that we have to manually add more colors if the total number of categories is greater than eight.
This becomes a bigger issue for the Pie charts.
If I have a Pie chart and the number of slices (i.e.
total values in the series) is greater than 8.Then the color pattern repeats every 8th entry.
This means that: 1.Item 1 and Item 9 appear together and they look like one slice 2.If there are no labels on the pie chart, there is no way to identify which is which.
Unless we provide the tooltips so that the user may identify which slice represents Item 1 and which represents Item 9.Besides, for SWT rendering, highlighting the slice when on legend hover is not available either.
Hence the Palette should either support more than eight colors or provide a way to generate new colors if needed.
