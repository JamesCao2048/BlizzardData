Bug 270189 Internal Browser does not work on Mac
Build ID: M20090211-1700 Steps To Reproduce: I have downloaded eclipse-reporting-ganymede-SR2-macosx-carbon.tar.gz and created a new workspace.
I have then tried to run the "My First Report" Example.
When I try to Preview the report BIRT tells me that "Internal browser is not available." It opens Firefox instead and displays the report there.
In the Eclipse preferences the internal browser is chosen for display.
I tried the same on Windows and it works perfectly.
