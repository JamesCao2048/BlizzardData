Bug 163749 Import BIRT runtime package to wtp will leave old birt files.
Description: Import BIRT runtime package to wtp will leave old birt files. Steps to reproduce: Prepare two birt builds. 1. Create a new BIRT Web Project with one build. 2. Use another build to open the same workspace, select the project and click Business Inteligent and Reporting Tools->Import BIRT runtime component. Expected result: Old birt runtime package will be replaced with new runtime package. Actual result: Old birt plugins were kept and new birt jar files are imported. e.g. org.eclipse.birt.report.engine_2.2.0.v20061101-0630.jar org.eclipse.birt.report.engine_2.2.0.v20061107-0635.jar
