Bug 271500 Class files not updated for data set preview
If I develop a java project and a BIRT project in the same workspace and I write a report that calls the pojo in a scripted dataseet that is defined in the java project, it does not refresh when I preview the dataset.
If I change the class and select preview dataset the old class is used.
If I preview the report it works fine.
The only way to solve it is to stop and start eclipse.
The webviewer uses the ReloadableClassLoader which reloads the urls, can we add something like this for the data set preview?
