Bug 268537 Add Report Nature
In versions of BIRT prior to 2.3 there was little compelling reason to associate a project with the BIRT Project perspective.
In fact, several of the other native perspectives work better for report design, particularly java or j2ee depending on the amount of java, js, and CSS that a project has.
With the advent of 2.3, and the new debug options and project specific reporting preferences, it becomes more compelling to have the the BIRT perspective.
Rather than force developers to change their old Java projects, it would be really nice to have a context item on the project that allows a report to add the BIRT Nature to the project.
An example of this can be seen by first having a standard Java project, and then right click on the project (while in java perspective).
You will get a PDE Tools item with an option to convert projects to PDE Projects, which brings up a dialog of all similar projects that do not have the PDE Nature and builders.
I don't think that we need to have all of the possible projects, if we simply had a context entry that said Add BIRT features, I think that it would be fine.
