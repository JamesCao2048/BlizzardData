Bug 133721 Generating PDF/Printable HTML reports with input parameters
I made improvements to the JSP for the Web Viewer to add the option to run the report with the parameters input by the users as a PDF or HTML page that is printable (using the /run?).
The parameters are stored as form field and the form is submitted.
This way, the user input parameters are passed to the /run?
I wanted to submit my changes, but can't figure out a way to do so
-- I can't go to the CVS right now...
Please advice so I can give you the changes.
I noticed that this feature was requested a lot on the newsgroup
- and I needed it myself...
So this should be integrated in the future release builds.
