Bug 110682 Pass-through of external context objects - BPS35
The BIRT engine is often embedded as part of a middle-tier application server, where the BIRT components are added to the mix of various J2EE components. During report run-time, some of these other components may instantiate context objects, which are served to the BIRT engine for its custom data source to use. The BIRT engine will thus need to pass through such external Java objects into the BIRT data source components for consumption. These context objects are assumed to be dynamically instantiated at report run-time, and are not statically defined in a report design. The scope of this project thus focuses on data source specific run-time Java objects which are instantiated external to BIRT, and are passed through to a custom data source provider plugged in the BIRT engine. Some examples of the types of external context objects that may be passed through to a BIRT data source provider include, an open JDBC connection, a pooled connection, user authorization keys, or query parameter v
alues collected outside of BIRT.
