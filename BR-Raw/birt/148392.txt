Bug 148392 Float type fails to be retrieven in scripted datasets
1/ Create a scripted dataset with Float type values, retrive them in the fetch dataset's method configure the output columns and assign them the Float type => result preview fails to show the float columns values 2/ Set the columns' type as Any => the result preview shows normally 3/ Create a chart based on the previous dataset configure the databindings setting float as the said columns type (the dataset's type is Any) => the series fails to appear in the graph (see error in footer) 4/ Change the data bindings for the said columns as Any and use the series fromatting to fix it => the series appears normally
