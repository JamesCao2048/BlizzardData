Bug 186926 Enhance methods name in IFont, a simple APi class in model
Two issues in IFont interface: 1. Bold is misspelled in setIsBold() method. 2. Setter method name for Boolean arguments is not good. I prefer setBold to setIsBold. There are four boolean-setter methods needing modification like that.
