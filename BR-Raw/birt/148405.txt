Bug 148405 Improve usability of Chart Scripting editor
The Designer should provide a scripting editor for chart, similar as the one for other report items: 1- Auto-color of keywords 2- Auto-completion 3- List methods in dropdown (note that parameters types and name should also be listed there with the method names, for instance: beforeGeneration(Chart chart, RuntimeContext context).
4- Each implemented method should be shown in bold in the dropdown 5- Each method should have a description to help the user understand it (as a tooltip for instance) 6- The whole script should still be shown at once, the dropdown is only used for navigation Method names should not be hard-coded, so an extension point can be requested by designer to pass such information (method name, parameter types, description), if there isn't any available yet.
Note that the chart can only pass the whole script to the designer, which needs to parse for functions to make the dropdown navigation work.
It's ok if the dropdown is ineffective if there are some syntax errors in the script (that prevent parsing).
Clicking on an empty method in the dropdown will automatically create a signature in the script body with the function name and default parameter names.
