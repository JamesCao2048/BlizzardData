Bug 277413 Chart view of xtab should behave the same as chart sharing xtab
Chart view of xtab should behave the same as chart sharing xtab, not only in preview result, but also in UI. Expected behavior: In select data page of chart view, data preview should have the same description and bindings list. If only one item in measures, select it automatically. Actual result: They are different. No description and no bindings list. The cube tree is not usable in this case.
