Bug 159857 [Improve Page Aggregate capabilities] Add support for page aggregates / page totals
At the moment, it is not possible to print page totals (or any other page-related aggregates) in the page header or footer.
I know that this is hardly possible because neither html nor pdf via FOP can tell anything about the page size or the print margins.
But I think, page aggregates are very essential for the success of BIRT.
Without this feature, a lot of projects will be forced to use other reporting engines.
My current project is one of those and in many european countries page totals in reports are required for almost all financial applications.
What I'm dreaming of: + page totals (e.g.
number of employees on this page, and sum of their salary) + accumulated (group) aggregates / continous summation (e.g.
number of employees so far, and sum of their salaries)
