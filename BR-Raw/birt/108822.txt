Bug 108822 More better logic is expected to process disk sorting when there is border value for row value
when sort on disk, if sort on 40000 rows data, and set the program process the data less than 40000.DtE do following operation 1.Save the file as temp file 2.Call the file to memory 3.Sort on the data 4.save the file to temp file 5.Copy the file to destination folder More better logic should supported here, say sort the data directly in memory and then write it to file
