Bug 121111 Bad event handler class name does not cause an error
Open a report design, open any Data Set's Property editor. Type in an invalid Java class name for the "Event Handler Class" property, say "aaa". Preview a report that uses that Data Set. The report executes normally. No error is shown. Event handlers are an integral part of a report design, and if a script handler class is not found, or if the handler throws a runtime exception, Report Engine should either stop the report execution, or show the error message in the generated report. (Tested with the 2005-12-15 nightly build)
