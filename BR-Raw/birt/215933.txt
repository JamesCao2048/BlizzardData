Bug 215933 [Regression]Inputing fraction number will force conversion.
In Format chart->Legend->Layout->Wrapping width text, input the fraction like "1/2" will force converting number to 0.5.It's correct for inputing one denominator digit.
However, you can't input "1/25" with more than one digit in denominator, since when you input "1/2", the fraction will be converted to decimal.
