Bug 164923 Format mask
this.style can be used only for single column, - this is not working for html text with an expression such as <value-of format="###,###,###.00"> row["AMOUNT"] </VALUE-OF> NOW THE NUMERIC FORMAT WILL BE AVAILABLE AS A PARAMETER SUCH AS params["NumericFormat"] when i write the script in oncreate <value-of format=params["NumericFormat"]> row["AMOUNT"] </VALUE-OF> this does not seems to work. The formating is ignored. Is there any workaround? regards
