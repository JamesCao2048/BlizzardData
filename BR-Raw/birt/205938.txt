Bug 205938 Cross Tab: 2.2.9 Measures from a cube can be dragged and dropped to left and not to right.
If user wants to show an existing measure on a cross tab that he has defined in a cube, he can only add it to the left and not to the right of an existing measure. Proposed solution User should be ale to add a measure both to the left and right of an existing measure.
