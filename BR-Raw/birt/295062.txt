Bug 295062 Print report as html produces false html header
If you click "Print Report" and print format "HTML" the BIRT Report Viewer produces a html page wich has a closing
</meta> tag in the header:
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; CHARSET=utf8"></meta> As a consequence IE and Firefox don't use UTF-8 encoding, and many characters are false (u, a etc.).
On other Birt Viewer pages the header is correct, only
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; CHARSET=utf8"> without the false closing "</meta>."
