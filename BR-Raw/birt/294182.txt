Bug 294182 Show values outside Axis ranges
I changed the scaling of the Y-Axis of a bar chart to min 105 - max 110 (Format Chart -> Y-Axis -> Scale). There are Y-Values which are smaller than 105 and so no bars are shown in the chart. Thats correct, but I want to display the values for instance value "99" for the second X-Value etc. but with no success. The checkbox "Show values outside Axis ranges" (Format Chart -> Y-Axis -> Scale) doesn't work. I tried it with Birt Designer 2.2 and 2.5.1
