Bug 102511 Enhance Highlighting to support Banding
Using the highlight feature to create a banded report results in a messy report.
To recreate, create a simple tabular report.
In the designer, select the detail row, go to the Highlights tab on the Property Editor view.
Add a new highlight, set its condition to be "row[0] % 2" "Equals" "0".
Set the formatting for the highlight to have a gray background color.
When the report is previewed, alternating rows have a background color for each cell.
The issue is that the backgrounds for the cells are not contiguous, there are spaces between each cell's background, and if a cell has a null value there is no background color.
In this situation the highlight should apply to the row, instead it is being applied to each cell.
If I manually set the background of a detail row to be gray I get the effect I want.
