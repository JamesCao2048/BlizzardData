Bug 222992 Quick jump to script editor via double clicking on scripts in outline view
In report outline view the "Scripts" subtree lists all the scripts defined in the report.
Once the user has located a script of interest however, there is no quick way for him to open the editor for the script.
He must first locate the report item containing the script, switch to Script tab view, and then select the event name from the drop down list.
I suggest that we make this easier by allowing the user to double click on the script node in the outline view to open the editor for that script.
