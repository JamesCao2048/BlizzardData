Bug 258627 Chart need a code change for the HTML in BIRT 2.5
1.HTML emitter has output the script function "redirect".
Now this script function has been prefixed with the htmlIDNamespace.
Chart need add the prefixe before use the script function.
The htmlIDNamespace can be gotten from the HTML option with the method "getHTMLIDNamespace".
2.The image's area must be well-formed: A.
"AREA" must be written into lowercase "area".
B.
"target" can't be a empty String.
You shouldn't output target when it's empty.
C.
"area" must has a "alt" value.
You should give an empty string value to the alt attribute when "alt" doesn't have a value.
