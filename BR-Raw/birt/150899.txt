Bug 150899 Cannot bind data values to chart series, which causes chart preview fail.
How to reproduce it?
1.Create a new chart, bind it with valid data set.
2.Assign the valid data values to category series and value series.
Current result: 1.There is no chart live preview in chart builder.
It still uses the default sample data.
2.Preview, dataset invalid exception is thrown out.
Investigation: It is perhaps caused by ResultSetWrapper.java.
There is no initializeMeta( ) in the Constructor.
