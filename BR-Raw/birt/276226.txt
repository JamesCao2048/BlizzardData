Bug 276226 Support diagonal line in excel
Currently, Diagonal line doesn't work in excel preview, may be excel doesn't support multiple diagonal lines.
But excel supports diagonal(Antidiagonal) line border, so if user define 1 diagonal line in BIRT, we can export it to be a diagonal line border in excel.
I think this case is very useful for Chinese report.
