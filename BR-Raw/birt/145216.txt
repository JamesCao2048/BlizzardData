Bug 145216 Drag and drop multiple columns in Edit Data Set dialog does not work
It is possible to select multiple columns in Edit Data Set dialog, but dragging and dropping them into the query text inserts only one of the selected columns. Expected: Either only on column is selectable or all selected columns are inserted (with comma as separator). Tested with BIRT2.1RC4.
