Bug 211004 Failed to remove temp db directory after running multiple reports
Description: I use Report Engine API to do runAndrender, run and dataextract tasks on multiple reports.
Before the Platform started, I change the temp folder(System.setProperty( "java.io.tmpdir", TEMP_HOME )).
Each task is closed after it finished and I shutdown the Platform after all the tasks finished.
In log I found "Fail to remove one or more file in temp db directory,but it will be removed when the VM exits: D:BIRT_NGtemp/BIRTSampleDB_1196129572031_10a6ae2".
In temp folder the BIRTSampleDB_XXX is still here but not removed.
I think it is the issue when remove the Temp sampleDB.
