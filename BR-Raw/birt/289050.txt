Bug 289050 Date locale support not working for advanced pattern strings in Bar Chart
Environment:
- JBoss 4.2.2 running on XP
- IE8 on XP
- BIRT 2.5 When working with a chart that has a date or date time axis, advanced patterns fail to take the locale into account.
Steps to reproduce: I created a report which displays a count of events by month in a bar chart and a table.
Dates are displayed on the X axis of the chart.
Because the dates specify a month I decided to change the date format for both the table and the chart.
In the chart I used the advanced pattern string "MMM YYYY" and set the label to a 45 degree angle.
In the table I used a custom format string "MMM YYYY".
Expected result: This should show dates in the chart and table as Aug 2009, Jan 2008, etc.
When the locale changes to say fr_FR the dates should appear in french, e.g.
avr.
2009, mai 2009, etc.
Actual Result: I've been using JBoss 4.2.2 on XP to run the web viewer and using IE 8 to test the reports.
When the client locale is set to en_GB all dates are displayed correctly.
When I changed the locale to another language (e.g.
fr_FR or de_DE) the table's dates are displayed correctly for the new locale but the chart still shows dates as they would be in english, i.e.
Apr 2009, May 2009, etc.
Additional information: I then changed the chart's date format to a standard one, SHORT or MEDIUM.
The chart now shows dates according to the locale.
It looks like locale support fails when using the advanced pattern string in the bar chart.
