Bug 197212 Cannot insert aggregation in detail row
Drag an aggregation item from the palette.
You cannot drop it in a detail row.
There are some aggregations, such as runningsum, movingave, percentrank, and rank, that make sense only when inserted in a detail row.
The workaround I discovered is to insert the aggregation item in a header or footer, then move the aggregation item to the detail row.
This workaround will confuse users, though.
The software should be fixed to allow inserting an aggregation item in the detail row.
