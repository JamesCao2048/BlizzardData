Bug 178682 value changing in cascading parameter group
let's say i have a cascading parameter group (single or multiple dataset) with three parameters like: Country State City the user can run reports over all countries, all states in a country, all cities in a certain state of a country or a certain city. so when the user starts the report, it should look like this Country: ALL State: ALL City: ALL the problem is now when i select a country, the first entry in the state listbox will be empty, like: Country: USA State: "" City: ALL i'd like that in the state listbox the default ("ALL") entry still is selected. (could also be the first entry in the state column, doesn't matter. but it definately shouldn't be blank.) i discussed this issue with Jason Weathersby. he suggested that i would edit the ComboBoxParameterFragment.jsp file in the WebViewer and delete the following fragment: if( parameterBean.isCascade( ) || parameterBean.allowBlank( ) ) { %> <OPTION></OPTION> <% } (you are only able to view a changed behaviour in the webviewerexample
deployed on tomcat. you can't see any change of behaviour in the designer preview.) what happened then was: At start (i set the default values for the parameters in the cascading parameter group to "ALL"): Country: ALL State: ALL City: ALL After i select the Country: Country: USA State: AL <- it selected automatically the first entry from the state column City: <- blank! what i need is that it shows either the default value of the city (which would be "ALL") or the first entry of the cities in the state of "AL".
