Bug 175803 format date time examples are incorrect
1. put a data field on report 2. select "format date time" in "properties" 3. select "custom" 4. in the examples in the "example formats" table are not correct if you use non english date/time settings in your microsoft windows preferences; e.g. "Short Date" is shown as "28.02.07" with "example code" "M/dd/yyyy", the correct value had to be "dd.MM.yyyy"
