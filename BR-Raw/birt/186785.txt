Bug 186785 create equivalent of profiler test bucket for JVMTI support
Build ID: I20070503-1400 Steps To Reproduce: The current test cases from the profiler bucket test the agent controller using JVMPI. We need to extend or adapt this to be able to run the applicable cases with the new profiler as well. More information: Currently I am running these manually using the test descriptions in /org.eclipse.tptp.ac.testautomation/automation-files/TPTP-tests/Platform.Agents.JVMPI.Windows_IA32.testsuite but using the ti agent instead of pi or the jdk1.5+ options where available.
