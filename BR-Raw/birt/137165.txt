Bug 137165 Stream closed exception
My report generates one simple chart.
The data to this chart are generated by my servlet as XML.
When I launch this report in web-based viewer (/birt/frameset?__report=) report is working, but when I launch it as standalone HTML (/birt/run?__report=) the viewer return exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: Stream closed at org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.xml.util.SaxParser.run(SaxParser.java:108) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)
