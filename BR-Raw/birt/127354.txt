Bug 127354 For template, relative path to template image does not work
Steps to reproduce: 1.Create a new template.
2.In the wizard, in Template Image, type a relative path to an image.
For example, use an image in the project directory in which you are creating the template.
Expected: It works.
Actual: Error "Image file '<file name>' does not exist" shows in the UI.
If you go ahead and create the template anyway, you cannot publish to the template folder, because Finish is not enabled.
