Bug 116706 Bad Class Cast in IDEReportEditor.java
So I'm trying to open a report with BIRT/Eclipse API using the BIRT 2.0 nightly build code (as of 11/16/2005).
the file IDEReportEditor.java method private IFile getFile( IEditorInput input ) { return ( (ReportFileEditorInput) input ).getFile( ); } However, input can be ReportEditorInput which is also an IEditorInput (to support reports found outside projects and workspaces) which doesn't even have a getFile() method on it.
This causes a deeply nested exception that causes the report desinger to not be able to show a report that might be physically located outside a workspace.
