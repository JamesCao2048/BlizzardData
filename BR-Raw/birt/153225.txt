Bug 153225 'Publish library in resource folder' should be available even if the library is not opened in editor.
'Publish library in resource folder' should be available even if the library is not opened in editor. Even if the user selects the library from the Navigator the option of Publishing library to Resource folder should be available from File menu as well as context menu. While the option is made available from context menu it still is not made available from File menu upon selection.
