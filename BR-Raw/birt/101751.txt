Bug 101751 Enhance IImagehandler interface to allow full customization of birt image handling mechanism
BIRT currently stores temp chart/image into a directory that the viewer provides. It assumes that the image can be accessed then as a static resource, bypassing the application server. This is achieved by generating chart/image URL that points to the image directly. In a WAR deployment environment, the image directory can no longer be specified under the web-application, because the web app installation directory can not always be found. The modified mechanism is to have the image directory as a hard-coded directory, instead of retrieved by getRealPath() call now. Because the images are no longer stored in the web app, they may not be accessible directly through URL without engine's help. The proposed solution is to enhance ImageHandler, so that it not only stored image, but returns image too. This way, the web application (viewer) could set the image handler, the engine writes the images, then the viewer, given a reference to the imahe handler, could call the get functions to retrieve
images and send back to client based on the URL. IImageHandler therefore needs to be enhanced. So do the default image handler implementations.
