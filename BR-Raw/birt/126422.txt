Bug 126422 New Report Wizard
My First Report template should not be selected as a default one thus needs to be moved to the second place. Once the very first report is created by the user, he might never use it again. Clicking on Finish button in the first step in the wizard should result in Blank Report creation. Remove the Show Report Cheat Sheet option for this report, since once unselected- it defeats the purpose of this report template.
