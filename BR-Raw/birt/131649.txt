Bug 131649 Designer generates wrong column reference expression for inner table
Open the attached report design (test1.rptdesign). This design uses a 2-level table to list offices and their employees. It runs fine. Now imagine that the designer wants to append a country name suffix to each employee name (e.g., "Diane Merphy / USA"). To do this double click on the inner list's Data Item to edit its expression. Click on "Available Data Sets", choose data set "offices", then double click on column "COUNTRY". An expression row["COUNTRY"] is added to the expression text. So you can construct an expression like this: row["FIRSTNAME"] + " " + row["LASTNAME"] + " / " + row["OFFICECODE"] However this report will not run. The problem is that row["OFFICECODE"] is not valid in the inner table. In order for the inner table to access the outer table's columns, the expression needs to use the "rows" object. So the correct behavior when the user double clicks on "COUNTRY" is to insert rows[0]["COUNTRY"] into the expression. The first index (an integer) to the "rows" array is the
0-based index of the nested table which contains the data set (0 = outermost table, 1 = first level inner table etc.). The report designer should figure out the correct index number by looking at the nesting levels of all tables.
