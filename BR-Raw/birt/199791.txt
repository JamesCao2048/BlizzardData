Bug 199791 Sybase Stored Procedures and Temp Tables
Using BIRT 2.2.0 I am try to create a data set that accesses a procedure in ASE Sybase.
I am able to select the procedure I want from the list available.
The problem is, if the procedure contains a temporary table and that table is is used to return the result set, no output columns will be displayed.
No preview results will be returned in the data set.
If a standard SQL select statement is entered in place of the temporary table, output columns and preview results will be returned in the data set.
Is there a configuration or parameter that I am missing?
Thanks Mark
