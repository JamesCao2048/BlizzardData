Bug 152665 Supports ODA Data Type - Timestamp and Time
Supports mapping of ODA scalar data types, Timestamp and Time, to ROM data types.
* Adds mapping of ODA "Timestamp" from/to "Date" type in DtE API to bridge the mapping of ODA "Timestamp" to a ROM "DateTime".
* Adds mapping of ODA "Time" from/to a DtE API type to bridge the mapping of ODA "Time" to a ROM scalarParameter data type.
(Specific mapping data type TBD)
