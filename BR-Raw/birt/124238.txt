Bug 124238 Grid without data binding will throw npe and break report.
In GridItemExecutor the following line of code will throw npe if there is no result set: IResultIterator rsIterator = ( ( DteResultSet ) rset ).getResultIterator( ); Need a null check.
This is very serious, it will break reports with grids that don't have data binding.
I consider this a showstopper for the 2.0 release.
