Bug 270230 DataSetEventAdapter: code not called if included from library
Build ID: M20090211-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create ReportLibrary: reportLib -> ScriptedDataSet: dataSet -> Table: table -> (Java) DataSetEventAdapter: jdsea -> table binds to dataSet -> dataSet uses jdsea Create Report and pull the Table from the ReportLibrary into this report. If you check the tables binding the reference seems correct -> reportLib.dataSet However the jdsea event methods are never called if you run the report. ---- You can make it running if you pull not only the table but also the dataSet into the report. (The binding still points to the reportLib.dataSet but it seems to be fine like that) ---- I think this is not as it is supposed to work. It's fine for us now since we know how to create the reports, but it took quite a while to find out. More information: If it was not clear enough i can provide you with an example.
