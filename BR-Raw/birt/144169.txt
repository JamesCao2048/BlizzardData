Bug 144169 [Accessibility] No way to make focus on list cells of Selection values panel in parameter editor by keyboard
No way to make focus on list cells of Selection values panel in parameter editor by keyboard. New a parameter to open parameter editor, set data type as String, display type as List Box, list of value as Static, then press Tab key to let Selection values panel get focus, you will find there is no way to set focus in list cells of Selection values panel in parameter editor by keyboard. It means no way to add static values to the parameter without mouse.
