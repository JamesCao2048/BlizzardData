Bug 121323 XML Edit Data Set dialog does not persist filter information
If one enters an XPath expression for the column mapping with a selection part like section[@id='left'] then within class RelationInformation the selection is stripped of and stored in filterInfo HashMap.
When leaving the dialog, RelationInformation gets persited to .rptdesign
- but data stored in filterInfo is lost.
However
- IMHO treating XPath expressions in that way will lead to a lot of trouble.
Why can't we use the plain XPath expression (of course prepended with the path from the data set selector itself) and let filtering be something for those which need it?
Kind regards, Herbert
