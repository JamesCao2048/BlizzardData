Bug 131152 when selecting a date field in SQL, the time is truncated to 00:00:00
using oracle 8.0 DB with oracle thin drivers "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver (v1.0)" (ojdbc14_V10.0.2.0.jar) Eclipse 3.1.1 (not myEclipse) My local is Gibraltar (GMT + 1) sql examples: 1) select mydate from mytable 2) select sysdate from dual when displaying these in the data set "preview results" dialog, the dates are correct, but all the times are displayed as 00:00:00, which is wrong, if I do the same thing in toad or quantum db, it shows the correct times, e.g.
12:34:01 The type of the output column is correctly set as Date If I drag the output colums to a report, and format the date using the "Format DateTime" in the "Property Editor
- Data" to show the time also, it comes out as e.g: 09 March 2006 00:00:00 GMT The only work around I have found is to hack it by getting oracle to return a string instead of a date, such as: Select to_char(sysdate, 'DD/MM/YYYY HH24:MI:SS') as mydate from dual But then I cant do any manuplutation using the date functions, e.g.
to see if one date/time is earlier than another date/time.
