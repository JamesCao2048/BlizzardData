Bug 100257 [Operations] "Add To Version Control" should be recursive
Right clicking an IContainer should provide a Team->Add To Version Control (recursive) menu item that adds all child resources and/or containers to version control that are not already in the repository. Command-line SVN and CVS provide this functionality, as do TortoiseCVS and TortoiseSVN. A very useful feature when multiple new files are to be added from multiple packages, helps to avoid forgetting to add a new file.
