Bug 224048 Support to get measure filter
Description: This is a enhancement. Currently, the crosstab has two kinds of filter: Level filter and measure filter. We can only get the level filter by using iLevel.getFilterConditions(). But if a user wants to define a measure filter or get and modify a measure filter in some processes, he cannot do that. I suggest to add this kind of functions in IMeasure.
