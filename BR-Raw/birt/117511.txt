Bug 117511 Toggling on and off the visibility of the datasets also toggles on and off the maker in the legend
I believe this problem is caused becasue the marker symbol that is shown in the legend has a source object that is associated with the series. The owner should change the target milestone. Not sure if it can get in for the M3 driver.
