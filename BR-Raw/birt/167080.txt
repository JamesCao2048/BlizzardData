Bug 167080 The name suffix when create report document.
In current DtE implementation, the suffix of created report document are like follows: QsXXX (XXX stands for a number) in query result of each query execution. The number will keep increased in a jvm, this is however not expected. Ideally, for each report render session(managed by Engine), the number(XXX) should be restarted. Otherwise, in real use of Data Engine, the jvm may exists for several days, which will cause the number suffix growing very big.This is not expected.
