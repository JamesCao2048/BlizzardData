Bug 212450 Expose Report Theme for scripting
Use case: Report library: theme.rptlibrary has 2 themes blue and green based on blue.css and green.css. Report design: theme.rptdesign uses theme.rptlibrary. there is a report parameter: theme that allows the user to select blue or green for the report theme. Using scripting, I want to be able to set the theme of the report based on the report parameter. In the script tab, the 'this' variable does not have theme exposed. Desired action: please expose theme to the report.
