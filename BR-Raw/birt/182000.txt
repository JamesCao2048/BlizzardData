Bug 182000 Cross tab layout behavior
In the current approach of cross tab layout view, the arrow is associated with the first data item in the cell. - User cannot delete measure and level data items which have arrow with them. -Wenbin has concerns with the approach, as this will make the UI very restrictive. - Also user may want to delete data item and just show image in a cross tab cell. We had a discussion with Bang, and he has revised the mockups for the layout - The idea is that the arrow is associated with the cross tab cell and not data item. Let us know if there are any issues with supporting this.
