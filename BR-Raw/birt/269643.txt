Bug 269643 Using consistentL&F in filter dialog
In BIRT designer, the data set editor filter dialog is different from that of table filter dialog.
This however is not expected for we want all the filter dialog in BIRT keep consistency in terms of L&F.
Data Set Editor should change to reuse Table's filter definition dialog.
