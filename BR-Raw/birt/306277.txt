Bug 306277 Designer: BIRT doesn't automatically link to library
I have a strange but very annoying issue.
Every time I open a report for which some items are linked to a library, the items are highlighted in red with an error "Content of this report item is corrupted...".
To get rid of this, I have to right-click on the rptdesign and choose "refresh library".
However, if I close the report and re-open it, the issue is back.
A better workaround is to keep the libraries open (first) and then open the reports.
In all cases, this is very annoying for users / developers.
I think that this is related to the fact that:
- we are using an absolute path for the resource and template folders (Eclipse settings).
- documents are using resources from a library which itself requires another library (common one).
The only workaround I found was to move all libraries inside my project.
