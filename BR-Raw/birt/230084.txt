Bug 230084 [General designer usability] Can't set BIRT resource folder to <project>/Shared
Suppose I create a project and use resource files.
At first, I put resources in my root folder.
Over time, as the number of files increase, I decide to put them in a folder within my project: "<project>/Shared".
Now, I've already got a number of reports, and I don't want to change them.
I just want to tell BIRT to use "<project>/Shared" as my resource folder.
Open Top Menu
--> Window
--> Preferences
--> Report Design
--> Resources.
Change the resource setting to "<Current Project Folder>Shared".
Let's test this.
Put an image in "<project>/Shared", call it "test.png." Create a new report.
Drag an image from the Palette.
Set it to "Image file in shared resources".
Notice that the list of available images is blank.
Evidentially BIRT can't handle the "<Current Project Folder>Shared".
Yet, BIRT did not complain when I set this in the preferences dialog.
It just silently failed when attempting to use the folder.
Expected: 1) If BIRT does not support resource folders relative to the current project, then BIRT should give an error at the time that this syntax is used rather than failing silently later.
2) Better, BIRT should support the "<Current Project Folder>Shared" notation (or some equivalent).
Apparently the workaround is to set the Resource path to the absolute location of my project's shared resources: "c:/paul/projects/Example Reports/Shared." However, this is not terribly portable.
And, it works for only one project.
That is, if I have more than one project, I need to leave the setting at the default; I can't push resources down one level without explicitly including the path in the resource name.
Expected to be able to make a statement that "for all projects, resources are in
<Current Project Folder>Shared."
