Bug 174105 Positioning Right-Hand Side Pie Legends
Hello, I often create pie charts with legends on the bottom so that all of the legend text (long strings) would be visible. If the legend is placed to the right of the pie chart, is there a way to present the legends so the text will not be clipped? I could not figure out how to reduce the plotting area containing the pie so that more space can be allocated to the legend. My customers prefer right-hand legends so any help would be appreciated. Cheers, Fred
