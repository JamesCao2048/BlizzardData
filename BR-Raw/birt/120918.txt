Bug 120918 Usability: Tabs above and below Layout Editor are confusing
In BIRT 2.0 (I'm using M3), the Layout Editor has tabs above and below the editor window to give the developer different views.
Top: Normal, Master Page, Source Bottom: Layout, Preview, Script What is not clear initially from the UI is that the bottom choices are only available with the "Normal" top choice.
In addition, the "Source" label is not clear
-- implication is that this is (programatic) source code.
The Usability team should look at this to determine what improvements could be made, but a suggestion would be to flatten this into a top set of tabs only: Report Layout, Master Page, Script, XML Report Design, Preview
