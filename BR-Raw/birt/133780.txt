Bug 133780 Execution sequence of valueExpr(DataItem) and onCreate() is not correct.
In the attached design. There is a DataItem in the table footer that I used to do a sum of the "Amount" column. In the test, I write the onCreate() method as: params["amount"]=Total.sum(row["AMOUNT"]); It passes the aggregation value to a parameter. In the "valueExpr" I write as: "AMOUNT:" + params["amount"] The expression is expected to export the sum. Actual output is: AMOUNT:null Followings are the definitions from Rom Text Spec & Rom Scripting Spec, valueExpr usually should be evalated after the onCreate() method. DataItem.valueExpr: The expression is usually evaluated when the report is rendered, not in the Factory, though it may be evaluated in the Factory also. onCreate: Executed when the element is created in the Factory. Called after the item is created, but before the item is saved to the report document file.
