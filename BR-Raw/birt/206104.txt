Bug 206104 [Data Access usability] Support to create a connection profile from a existing datasource
After creating a datasource with all the connection properties, he wants to create a connection profile to store these properties and he must go Data Source Explorer to create that.
From user's opinion, to be more convenient I hope we may integrate DTP's creating connection profile in datasource and support to export or create a connection profile from a existing Data Source in BIRT.
