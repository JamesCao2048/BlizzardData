Bug 101039 Series colors do not have different default values
When you create a pie chart, all colors are gray by default.
When you create a bar chart with multiple Y series, additional Y series are all gray by default.
Expected: The pie chart should have different colors for each value by default.
For bar charts, the additional series should be automatically be assigned a different color by default.
