Bug 280913 Excessive decimal places in image tag sizes
I am looking at the HTML generated by a report that contains several charts. I see image tags like the following: <img class="style_28" id="AUTOGENBOOKMARK_43" src="file:/tmp/custom6.png" alt="" style=" width: 540pt; height: 172.8000030517578pt;"></img> Observe the value for height in the style attribute above. Obviously a point is so small that any fraction of it is almost imperceptible, and 13 decimal places is excessive for any unit of measurement.
