Bug 284130 bad PDF with parallel report
I have a parallel report with two tables, each in a column of a grid. One table detail row has a visibility condition 'row.__rownum % 2 != 0', and the other 'row.__rownum % 2 == 0'. It woks fine in the preview. But, in the PDF report, the output of the second column starts only at the end of the first column. It works fine in 2.3.2 => regression. Regards, Christophe Baudin
