Bug 200187 Deprecated HTMLServerImageHandler methods are not marked as deprecated
Build ID: 3.3.0 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Open IHTMLServerImageHandler and look at e.g. "public abstract String onDesignImage(IImage image, Object context)", which is marked as "deprecated" 2. Open HTMLImageHandler and look at e.g. "public String onDesignImage( IImage image, Object context )" which is not marked as deprecated The implementation class HTMLImageHandler which implements IHTMLImageHandler should mark the deprecated methods of IHTMLImageHandler as deprecated. E.g. public String onDesignImage( IImage image, Object context ) { return null; } to /** * @deprecated */ public String onDesignImage( IImage image, Object context ) { return null; } Reason: If someone (like me) extends the HTMLServerImageHandler class, he gets the following warning in the console (not in Eclipse): MyHTMLServerImageHandler.java:18: warning: [deprecation] onDesignImage((org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.IImage,java.lang.Object) in org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.IHTMLImageHandler has been deprecated I
have to overwrite every in IHTMLServerImageHandler as deprecated marked method, to "remove" this warnings, like that: /** * @deprecated */ public String onDesignImage( IImage image, Object context ) { super.onDesignImage(image, context); } Would be nice, if this would be fixed.
