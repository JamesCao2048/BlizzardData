Bug 159033 Adding Datasource Property Bindings with 10,000+ ids causes incorrect XML creation.
I have a large report that has programatically generated more than 10,000 ids for my report components.
Now, I go to edit the property bindings for the data source for my report, so that I can specify parameter-defined database connection properties.
When I look at the XML, I find that the
<list-property name="propertyBindings"> section was incorrectly created by the report designer.
(See below for sample).
<list-property name="propertyBindings">
<structure>
<property name="name">odaDriverClass</property>
<property name="id">13,218</property>
</structure>
<structure>
<property name="name">odaURL</property>
<property name="id">13,218</property>
<expression name="value">params["DBConnectionString"]</expression>
</structure>
<structure>
<property name="name">odaUser</property>
<property name="id">13,218</property>
<expression name="value">params["DBPassword"]</expression>
</structure>
<structure>
<property name="name">odaPassword</property>
<property name="id">13,218</property>
</structure>
<structure>
<property name="name">odaJndiName</property>
<property name="id">13,218</property>
</structure>
</list-property> Once I look at the XML once, I can never go back to Layout/Preview/...
tabs.
I recieve the error "Error in XML Source Page must be corrected before other pages can be used." The issue is that the line(s):
<property name="id">13,218</property> are causing the XML parser to break.
I can manually fixing this by removing the comma in the id variable, so the line(s) should look like:
<property name="id">13218</property> So far, this only seems to be occuring on IDs generated for data source property bindings.
The real issue with this is that, I never realized there was an error until I viewed the "XML Source" tab.
And after I looked at it once, I was not able to return to any other tabs thereafter.
