Bug 136987 Images that span over multiple pages are scaled when generating PDF
I have a chart and a table in a report. The chart and table have a width value of 1900 pixels. Therefore the chart and table spans two pages. Now I want to convert this report to PDF. It seems that the PDF version scales the width. I don't want the image to scale. I would like the image to span over multiple pages.
