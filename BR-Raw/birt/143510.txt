Bug 143510 mysql column alias problem
I was using the following select statement as my data source: select id_case, cases.id_state, states.state, cast(summary AS CHAR) as summary, cast(descr AS CHAR) as descr, start_date, cast(client_text AS CHAR) as client_text, group_elements.name, groups.name from states, cases LEFT OUTER JOIN group_elements ON id_analist = group_elements.id_ge LEFT OUTER JOIN groups ON cases.id_group = groups.id_group where states.id_state = cases.id_state when I came across this issue.
In the preview (I'm not sure if the same happens after report generation), group_elements.name and groups.name values don't show up correctly.
In fact, groups.name appears as "name_9" (which of course isn't a problem) but its values are the same as group_elements.name values.
Using an alias for one of the columns solves this issue.
(Obviously this might be an issue with the mysql driver, but I don't think that's the case)
