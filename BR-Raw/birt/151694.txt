Bug 151694 appContext is null when evaluating parameters

We used a jdbcbridbe, and thru appContext, we're retrieving jndi name and others parameters usueful for our datasource.
In those case, during the evaluation of parameters, appContext is null so the datasource used to populate values of the parameters are not from the same database ...
