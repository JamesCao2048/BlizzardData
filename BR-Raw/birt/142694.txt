Bug 142694 Ability to set a default name for file when getting preview as pdf
Actually the name of file, in preview as pdf, is always: "run[1].pdf". It would be very useful to have the ability to set a differente default name for file. Even the name of file could be resulting from an input parameter. This enhancement serves to user having to create a lot of reports, in Report Designer, and every time he have to write the name of report before to save in pdf.
