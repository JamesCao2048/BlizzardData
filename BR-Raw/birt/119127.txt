Bug 119127 Accessing data: UTF-8 BOM encoded text file causes problems
Create a simple flat file to use as a data source.
Save it as UTF-8 using Notepad in Windows.
Try to use it as a flat file data souce: 1.Create a new XML data source: This can be successfully created and a new data source appears in the project data sources.
2.Create a new XML: Click New Data Set on context menu.
3.Define new XML data set.
Select XML data source.
Choose Next.
4.Select the sample.xml file.
Choose Next.
5.Choose XPath Expression.
You cannot continue.
There are no options available in the XML structure portion of the screen.
Clicking Next does nothing.
User cannot advance.
Evaluation from Lin Zhu: The sample xml file is of UTF-8 BOM format rather than the standard UTF-8 format.
If we simply save that xml file to standard UTF-8 format then everything is all right.
Although Xecers claims that it supports UTF-8 BOM encoding, when we pass a file encoded with UTF-8 BOM it will throw a SaxParserException which reads " Content is not allowed in prolog", and this is usually caused by error encoding information.
