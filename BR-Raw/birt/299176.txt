Bug 299176 Provide visibility to a custom Data Set Wizard on the type of ODA design session
The oda.design.ui framework applies the same set of data set pages, contributed by an ODA ui dataSource extension, for both creating and editing a data set design. In some use cases, a custom ODA designer may want to use a specific data set page only while creating a new design in a wizard, but not while editing; or vice versa. For example, the enablement.oda.ws.ui designer implementation wants to hide its SOAP Parameters data set page while editing its data set design in an editor dialog. An extension defined DataSetWizard may override the framework's default behavior, but would need to know whether it is being used in a new design session, or an editing session. This enhancement is to provide an API method for an ODA data set wizard to get the type of design session that it is in.
