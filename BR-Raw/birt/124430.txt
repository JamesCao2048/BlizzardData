Description: Library explorer keep gray even you add library file in Preferences. Steps to reproduce: 1. New several library files and add them through Window-->Preferences menu. 2. New a report and open Library Explorer view. Expected result: Library files display inside it. Actual result: It is gray with nothing inside. I cannot find add button in Library Explorer to add a library file,either.
