Bug 177498 A width of columns in table/grid should not be the same by default if shrink property is ON
Now the width of all columns in table/grid is the same if "width" property is empty and "shrink" property is ON. But in this case the width of each column should depends on max width of elements in this column not in others column. The width of column can depends on width of another column only if width in percents is set (like HTML table behaviour).
