Bug 175587 Consolidate IReportEngine.shutdown() and destroy() methods
Interface IReportEngine has two methods, shutdown() and destroy(), that appear to have identical functionality according to their JavaDoc comments.
However as of 2.1.2 build destroy() is the method that actually cleans up the resources; shutdown() does not do anything useful.
We need to do the following: (1) Deprecate method shutdown() (2) Make shutdown() call destroy() internally so that older code that uses that method can function properly.
