Bug 100964 Provide Support for the Eclipse 3.1 Platform Release
BIRT 1.0 was designed to work on the released Eclipse 3.0.1 / 3.0.2 platform the current release during development of BIRT (and since BIRT did not have any dependencies on new Eclipse platform 3.1 features).
BIRT 1.0 has not been extensively tested on, and does not claim support for, the upcoming Eclipse 3.1 platform release.
When the Eclipse 3.1 platform release is made available at the end of June, BIRT needs to be tested with, and provide support for, this release.
This will allow application developers using Eclipse 3.1 to utilize BIRT in their applications.
Since many developers are also still using Eclipse 3.0.1 / 3.0.2, if possible, BIRT should also continue to support these versions.
This is particularly important for BIRT to be used with commercial products that are based on Eclipse 3.0.1 technology.
