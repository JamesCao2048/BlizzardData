Bug 169677 Support for context-relative paths settings within web.xml
The folders in which the rptdesign files are stored, the folders for generated images etc. can be configured through web.xml context parameters. By default, however, BIRT does not allow to set context-relative paths within these parameters. Either you leave the parameters blank, then context-relative defaults are used. Or you set the parameters, but then you have to supply an absolute path which is very unconvenient. For example, BIRT by defaults takes the report directly out of the context root directory. But then everybody has read access to the rptdesign files using HTTP GET. Instead, we want to put the rptdesign files into a sub-folder of WEB-INF. We do not want to specify absolute paths, however, to be able to deploy the same WAR file to different servers. What we would like to have, is support for a notation like this one: <context-param> <param-name>BIRT_VIEWER_DOCUMENT_FOLDER</param-name> <param-value>$CONTEXT/WEB-INF/reports</param-value> </context-param> This feature could ea
sily be added to the classes ReportEngineService and ParameterAccessor, where the context parameters BIRT_VIEWER_IMAGE_DIR, BIRT_VIEWER_WORKING_FOLDER, BIRT_VIEWER_DOCUMENT_FOLDER and BIRT_VIEWER_SCRIPTLIB_DIR are retrieved.
