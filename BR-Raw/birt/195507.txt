Bug 195507 not support <font size="-2">
Build ID: 2.2.0 Steps To Reproduce: 1. create a text, input some html code, including <font size="-2"> 2. view as PDF result: error occurs Jul 5, 2007 5:38:50 PM org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.layout.pdf.util.HTMLStyleProcessor execute SEVERE: There is a invalid value for property SIZE of element FONT in the HTML. As far as I know, BIRT will calculate the font size in html and then convert to its own scale. I do not think it is good idea to be smart. Maybe I am wrong, I did not get the rationale behind it. But this SEVERE error should not be exposed. More information:
