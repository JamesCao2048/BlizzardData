Bug 221617 Support sorting and fetch window in IDataExtractionTask
As IDataExtractionTask is often used to power parameter value list in for report document viewing, it's desirable for the user of the API to be able to specify a sort order for the return list, and to specify a fetch window for the row set. This enhancement request is for Engine to add the following methods to either IDataExtractionTask, or another class designed to provide task options for data extraction. /** Sets the sort order of the row set returned in extraction result */ void setSort( org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.api.ISortDefinition[] sort); /** Sets the index of the first row to fetch. First row has an index of 0 */ void setStartRowIndex( long rowIndex); /** Sets the maximum number of rows to return in fetch result. */ void setFetchLimit( long maxRows);
