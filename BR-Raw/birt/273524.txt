Bug 273524 beforeGeneration causing an NPE
After adopting BIRT 2.3.2, we started seeing NPEs caused by the following javascript in our design file.
I have attached a simplified version of the report design file.
Just open it and preview it and the exception will happen.
If you edit the beforeGeneration method and comment out the line: xAxisPrimary.getScale().setMin(start); then the problem goes away.
But we need that line to work around another bug where BIRT sometimes leaves big blank gaps atv the begining of a chart.
