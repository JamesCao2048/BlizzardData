Bug 147542 XML data set designer shows no available columns with attached files
Create an XML data source using BOTH the attached XML file and XSD schema file.
Then create a data set using /ITEMS/ITEMSROW as row mapping.
In the next dialog to define column mapping, no available column is shown under ITEMSROW.
If only the XML file (but not the XSD schema file) is specified the data source, all available columns are shown.
