Bug 190722 [Crosstab improvements] Xtab filter should allow filtering on any cube dimension
In the current (2.2) XTab filter editor, you can only select filter on a level that's placed on an edge in the XTab. We should allow the filter condition to refer to any level in the cube, whether or not it is otherwise used in the XTab. As an example, a XTab report may place level Time/OrderDate on the column, and level Product/ProduceLine on the row. The design may however want to filter the Xtab based on the Geography/Country level (not shown in the xtab), so that the table only shows data for Country == "USA".
