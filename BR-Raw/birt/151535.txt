Bug 151535 Parameters are invisable in Joint Dataset
Trying to use "Joint Dataset" combined with parameters within underlaying Data-Sets (neccessary to achive a filtering where clause for a DateTime Field) Parameter editing ( e.g. in Chart designer) do not show the entire parameter. As specified it should show and let to edit a combination of both underlaying datasets' parameters.
