Bug 123035 Serialize primitive types, hashmaps and other Java classes not using Java serialization method
If you take a look at the serialized engine output, we frequently see java classes appearing.
I see String class; I see PageHint class; I see Hashmap classes.
All of these should be gone so that BIRT document is independent of any Java-based class serialization.
DtE team will move primitive type serialization to BIRT.CORE, see 123034.Engine can use that.
