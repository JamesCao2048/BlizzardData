Bug 207568 BIRT standalone Designer Fixed Colum width presentation
Build ID: v20070924-0630 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Create new report 2.Create table with fixed-width columns, each column being .5 inches and enough columns to use entire width between margins.
3.Bind to table fields with field names that cause designer's column width to exceed width shown when unbound.
More information: I just downloaded and installed the 2.2.1 standalone designer.
I copied a .rptdesign file from my 2.1.2 workspace to the 2.2.1 workspace and then opened it.
Unlike in 2.1.2, the layout mode in 2.2.1 doesn't give an accurate (or even close) representation of the report format.
The second table in my report has 10 data cells/fields.
They are set to 3 in wide for the first cell and .5 inches for each of the remaining cells, totaling 7.5 inches.
In 2.1.2, the layout view showed all the fields within the defined margins.
When the data cells showed the bound field names, the cells would expand vertically and the field name would wrap.
In 2.2.1, the cell's width expands to include the field name without wrapping, the cells have variable visible widths, and the table extends outside the margins of the report.
The report in preview mode works fine.
This layout problam only exists in the layout view.
Is there new setting to affect this behavior or is this a bug?
This also occurred in 2.2.
