Bug 192281 variant portion of locale is ignored during internationalization
The use of resource files for internationalization ignores the variant portion of the locale.
For example we have reports that rely on a label.properties file for the column headers.
If the current locale is es_MX the report will properly display the labels from label_es_MX.properties.
However if the locale includes a variant such as es_MX_client all of the labels still get loaded from label_es_MX.properties rather than label_es_MX_client.properties.
According to the FAQ on internationalization: "When you run your report, BIRT will use the standard Java system for locating a property file that matches the user's locale." From that I would assume the same property lookup order used by the java ResourceBundle class: * baseName + "_" + language1 + "_" + country1 + "_" + variant1 * baseName + "_" + language1 + "_" + country1 * baseName + "_" + language1 * baseName + "_" + language2 + "_" + country2 + "_" + variant2 * baseName + "_" + language2 + "_" + country2 * baseName + "_" + language2 * baseName Where the specified locale is language1_country1_variant1 and the default locale is language2_country2_variant2 To reproduce: 1.create a report that has a label bound to a base resource file and deploy it.
2.create a locale specific (including variant) version of the base resource file and deploy it.
3.render the report using the viewer and pass in the __locale parameter consisting of the full locale used in step 2 At this point you should be able to confirm the location of the loaded label is not from the variant version of the resource file.
