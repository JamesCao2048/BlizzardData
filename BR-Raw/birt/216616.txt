Bug 216616 Axis and plot chart should share their height or width
For charts inside crosstab, the plot and axis chart need to share their height (or width depending on orientation).
So resizing one of them vertically (or horizontally) should reassign the other one as well, or you end up with inconsistent charts, and the axis height doesn't match the plot height.
