Bug 176101 Shared Libraries node in Library Explorer should show the path on mouse over
Shared Libraries node in Library explorer should have a mouse over tooltio that would give the absolute path to that folder. As user defines where he keeps his resource folder it is a useful hint. Moreover to look for this path user has to go under Window>preferences>Resource to find out where the Resource folder is located. HAving the mouse over hint of the path is useful here.
