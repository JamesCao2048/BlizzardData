Bug 224262 BIRT: UI to restore a deleted table Detail band is obscure
Open the attached report design.
It uses groups to summarize orders for customers in the sample database.
When run, the detail band produced unwanted white space in the output.
So, I deleted the Detail band and the report displays as I wanted.
However, I struggled for a long time before I figured out how to put the detail band back if I ever needed it.
The most obvious thing to try is to select the Table tab in the layout editor.
Open the context menu.
We can Insert Groups, but there is nothing to insert a Detail band.
Select the innermost group header.
Open the context menu.
We can insert a group above or below, but we can't insert a detail band.
Select the table.
Go through all the property tabs.
There is nothing that will turn the Detail band back on.
Out of desperation, try using the context menu items on the table heading chicklets.
Try the first column heading.
No.
Try the left-most chicklet in the corner.
Eureka! There is the Insert
--> Detail option.
Expected that Insert
--> Detail would appear elsewhere: in the Table tab menu, in the group header/footer menu and in all table heading chicklets.
