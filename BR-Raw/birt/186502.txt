Bug 186502 Support more dateTimeLevelType for cube
Model has added more dateTimeLevelType on cube definition.
Current available types are: year, quarter, month, week-of-month, week-of-year, day-of-week, day-of-month, day-of-year, hour, minute, second.
This need Dte to provide corresponding support as well.
