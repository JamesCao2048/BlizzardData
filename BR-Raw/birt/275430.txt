Bug 275430 Add columns in master page
Add columns element in the simple-master-page to define the column count in the master page. The columns has two properties: 1, count, defines the column count in the master page. The value should be a integer. The default value is 1 which means only one column in the master page. 2, gap, defines the spaces between the columns. The default value is 12pt.
