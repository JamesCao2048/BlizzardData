Bug 182880 SVG charts have some fuzzy elements
Text with small font (size <14) appears fuzzy on SVG output due to anti-aliasing. The same chart in PNG looks sharper for small fonts. The SVG renderer should disable anti-aliasing for small fonts, which are not rotated, not bold, not italics. Another issue is that horizontal and vertical lines appear fuzzy due to anti-aliasing. If possible the renderer should disable anti-aliasing for those as well.
