Bug 160542 Improve Sample Data in Chart Builder
- Show more points (5 instead of 3)
- Make sure two identical series have different data values so the output is not identical for both series
- Create specific sample data for each series type to demo the specificities of the series
- Scale data according to hard-coded values in the chart model such as Scale Min/Max, or marker lines/ranges positions
