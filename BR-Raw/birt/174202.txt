Bug 174202 Pie chart 'minimum slice' label category values don't match legend
To reproduce: Create a pie chart Use Category Data as label values Set a minimum slice percentage Enable a legend Expected behaviour: Slice label should should match legend Actual behaviour: Slice label uses one of the consolidated categories, and not the minimum slice label.
