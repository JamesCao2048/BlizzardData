Bug 153506 Strange error message when group key refers to bad binding column name
Run attached report design.
The following error is shown: Group key "groupkey" in group 1 cannot depend on column bindings defined in the group lower than itself.
This is a strange error.
Since the actual problem is that the table's binding column "groupkey" is defined to refer to another existing binding: row["bad"].
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The error message should clearly indicate that a non-existing binding is the cause of the failure.
