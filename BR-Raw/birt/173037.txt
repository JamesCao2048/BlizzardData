Bug 173037 How to get drill-through "action/targetFileType" property at runtime?
My report design contains drill-through hyperlinks to another report design or particular report document.
The link target document type is represented by action/targetFileType property in the design XML file, for example:
<structure name="action">
<property name="reportName">cust_orders_payments.rptdocument</property>
<property name="targetFileType">report-document</property> ...
</structure> At runtime, I receive IAction object, for example in a custom IHTMLActionHandler implementation, but it has no targetFileType property.
Is it possible to obtain it somehow or is it a bug?
