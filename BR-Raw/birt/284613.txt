2) In the Data Explorer, right click on Data Sources and click New Data Source.
Problem Description: Labels of radio buttons have dots at their ends.
Can you please remove them?
99% of radio button labels doesn't have them, there is no reason for the two labels to have dots.
Similar problem occurs for some checkboxes on panels following main panel.
Thanks, Kamil
