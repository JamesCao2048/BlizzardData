Bug 117476 Poor rendering quality
I want to know of one can improve the PDF (and HTML) rendering quality. The quality for HTML rendering is OK for showing on screen because of less resolution of the screen, but the PDF rendering quality and its result on a paper is really poor. If you look on a printout of a bar chart, the fonts, axis' and bars appear very coarse and unsharp. It seems to be the same image resolution as showing in HTML format on screen. One can see each pixel. Also one can see JPG block-artefacts in text areas. Is there a way to set / modify / improve the rendering quality for printouts / HTML? Thanks for any information!
