Bug 292109 Upgrade to BIRT 2.5.1 via update site: NullPointerException at report creation
1) If I explicitly download BIRT 2.5.1 with the eclipse update manager then the report creation works fine. 2) If I download the plugins of our software with the eclipse update manager then the report creation fails with a NullPointerException: java.lang.NullPointerException at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.executor.ReportExecutor.execute(ReportExecutor.java:123) at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.internal.executor.wrap.WrappedReportExecutor.execute(WrappedReportExecutor.java:60) at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.internal.executor.dup.SuppressDuplciateReportExecutor.execute(SuppressDuplciateReportExecutor.java:42) at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.internal.executor.wrap.WrappedReportExecutor.execute(WrappedReportExecutor.java:60) at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.impl.RunAndRenderTask.doRun(RunAndRenderTask.java:168) at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.impl.RunAndRenderTask.run(RunAndRenderTask.java:75) (The DataEngine seems to be null. "ExecutionContext.openDataEngine()" catches
an exception) 3) The only dependency of our report creation plugin to a BIRT plugin is: "org.eclipse.birt.report.engine". In the past this was enough to get the necessary BIRT plugins to create the report successfully (with BIRT 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x). 4) Now I detected that, if I add the plugin "org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.script.javascript" (seems to be new in BIRT 2.5.1) manually to the plugins downloaded via eclipse update manager, the report generation works fine. Is it really necessary to add a new explicit plugin dependency to this new plugin? We would have a problem in this case because our report generator plugin have to work with eclipse 3.2 (BIRT 2.1.x), eclipse 3.3 (BIRT 2.2.x) and eclipse 3.4 (BIRT 2.3.x), too. And then we get a problem because in elder BIRT versions this plugin doesn't exist...(specifying this new plugin as an "optional" plugin doesn't solve the problem after the download from update site, too) I assume there is a missing dependency within BIRT 2.5.1..
Jason asked me to create this bugzilla entry.
