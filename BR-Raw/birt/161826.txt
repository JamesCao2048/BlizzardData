Bug 161826 problem on extracting data in XML data source using predicates
While extracting data from an XML data source, there seems to be a problem on using a predicate in the column mapping for a table. In the following example XML file (also attached to the bug), books.xml, I was trying to get the book titles with "en" as their "lang" attribute, so specified Table Mapping: /library/book Column Mapping: /title[@lang="en"] However, instead of getting the book titles in the column, I had the "en" strings in the entire column. This seems to be a bug to me. If not, I would like to find out how to specify the Table/Column Mappings properly.
