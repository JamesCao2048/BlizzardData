Bug 266459 Patch: Compile fix for Rhino 1.7
The attached patch fixes compilation with Rhino 1.7 prereleases.
The patch is simply putting more restriction to the parameter, so this should not cause any other problems, unless an Object that do not implement Scriptable is passed.
Such cases will simply fail with newer rhino so it is better to be found at compile time.
