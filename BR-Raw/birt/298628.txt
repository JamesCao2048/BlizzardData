Bug 298628 Improve UI usability of the "Externalize to Connection Profile" Option
In BIRT Data Explorer, select "Externalize to Connection Profile..." option in the context menu of a data source design that has referenced an external connection profile. The ExportDataSourceDialog opens. Press Ok. An error message is displayed saying that the data source has already externalized its properties. For better UI usability, the "Externalize to Connection Profile..." menu option should ideally be disabled when a data source is already externalized. But doing such validation could impact performance. Alternatively, the ExportDataSourceDialog should have made the validation on open, and disabled its Ok button with an appropriate message in the dialog. Note: the validation (on whether a data source has already externalized to profile) can be made by calling oda.design.DataSourceDesign#hasLinkToProfile().
