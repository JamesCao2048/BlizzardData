Bug 122656 URL builder improvement - usability issue
Currently the URL builder don't display the available target bookmarks.
This makes it difficult to use especially if the report is designed by some one else.
See attched UI mockup with the suggested improvement: URL builder will display the available target bookmarks for internal bookmark link and drill through links.
This improvement require DE support and engine support.
I will file a separate bugs for those required changes.
