Bug 131186 Enhance birt.data.aggregation extension point to support multipass
The current org.eclipse.birt.data.aggregation extension point ( and associated org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.api.aggregation classes) can only support single-pass aggregates.
We need to extend this framework to support custom multi-pass aggregates.
One example: a percentage-to-total aggregate ( x/SUM(x) ) will require two passes over the series.
A prelimary design of the new extension point: Introduce a new Aggregation abstract class in birt.data.engine.api: public abstract class Aggregation implements IAggregation { /** Returns the number of passes over the data series that the accumulator of this aggregate requires.
For SUMMARY aggregates, the accumulator returns a value after all passes are complete.
For RUNNING aggregates, the accumulator returns data in the last pass.
*/ public int getNumberOfPasses() { return 1; } } The Accumulator class can remain as is.
However the comment to indicate that for multipass aggregates, start() and finish() will be called at the beginning and end of each pass.
The aggregation extension point's aggregateClass element should indicate that the class needs to subclass Aggregation.
Also, this element's kind should be changed to "java" and its "Based On" changed to "org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.api.aggregation.Aggregation".
