Bug 176107 row.__rownum cannot be directly used as group key
Create a table that bind it to a data set.
Insert a group.
For the Group On field, click on the "..." button to edit the expression, and select from "Availble Column Bindings" | "Table" | "RowNum".
This creates a Group On Expression "row.__rownum".
The resulting report design cannot be run.
It produces error: Column binding "row.__rownum" does not exist.
To workaround this, one must create another binding on the table and set its expression to "row.__rownum", then use the new binding as group key.
This should not have been necessary.
The "__rownum" binding should be implicitly available in all contexts that have a data set.
E.g., it should be usable directly as group key, sort key, and in conditional format expressions, etc.
Attached is a sample report that produces the error.
