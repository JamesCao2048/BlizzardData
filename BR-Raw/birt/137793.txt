Bug 137793 Chart parameter and data access needed in scripts
I have a pie chart that displays some data. When I click on a slice, I want to execute a javascript function and pass some of the properties of the report and the slice to the function. For example I would like to pass some of the parameters of this report to this javascript. In addition the data related to the slice clicked on shoule be accessible. The same data and can be used via the drillthrough interactivity action. The way I would envision this working would be: 1) Open the chart properties. 2) Navigate to the Format Chart tab 3) Select the Value Series and click the Interactivity button 4) Associate a Mouse Click action that invokes a script 5) The configuration of the script should allow for parameters (params[]) and data specific to the section of the chart (pie slice, bar...) to be entered. Similar to the values which can be referenced in the drill through functionality.
