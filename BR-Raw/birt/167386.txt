Bug 167386 border property definition in custom jsp tags isn't correct.[0603]
Description: border property definition in custom jsp tags isn't correct.
Build number:2.2.0.v20061211 Steps to reproduce: 1.New a BIRT Web Project.
2.New a jsp file based on BIRT template.
3.Input below content in body:
<birt:viewer id="1" reportDesign="birt_tag_sample.rptdesign" contextRoot="wtp_jsp_tags" border="10">
</birt:viewer> 4.Run the jsp file.
Expected result: The description for border in BIRT_JSP_TAG_SPEC_FINAL.doc is "Sets the border of report container in pixels." If border represents border style, it should display border with 10px width.
If border represents frameBorder for IFrame, it'd better change name to frameBorder.
Actual result: No border style in IE browser.
I checked the page source and found that border value was set to frameBorder property of IFrame.
However, according to css standdard, frameborder = 1|0 This attribute provides the user agent with information about the frame border.
Possible values: * 1: This value tells the user agent to draw a separator between this frame and every adjoining frame.
This is the default value.
* 0: This value tells the user agent not to draw a separator between this frame and every adjoining frame.
Note that separators may be drawn next to this frame nonetheless if specified by other frames.
The issue is that: 1."border" name is confusing, and it is very likely to be regarded as border style for element.
2.Description in BIRT_JSP_TAG_SPEC_FINAL.doc is incorrect.
