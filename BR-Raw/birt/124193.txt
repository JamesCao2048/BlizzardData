Bug 124193 Parent axis doesn't work for recursive XPath
When table mapping for XML files is specified via recursive XPath: e.g. "//book", the parent axis access is broken for column mappings on such table: e.g. "../bookstore/@name" will not work. Same parent axis access works fine if non-recursive XPath is used for table mapping: e.g. "/bookstore/book".
