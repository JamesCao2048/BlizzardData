Bug 200979 BIRT Cross tab - Better error messages
In general the error messages are very generic
- either "Cube does not exist" followed by stack trace or
- stack trace.
From the error message it is difficult to fix the problem in the report design.
I have attached a couple of report design, in which case the error messages are so difficult to follow.
We need to show user friendly error messages.
( This bug applies to data engine errors and engine errors ).
