Bug 189358 The "New Data Binding" dialog is confusing
Description: In today's build, a "New Data Binding" dialog replaces the old one.
But it seems very confusing.
According to the spec attached with #130686, when an "Aggregation" in the palette view is pulled into the table group footer layout, an "Aggregation Builder" is trigged.
Actually, "New Data Binding" dialog appears instead.
In this builder, there are two filters setting, they are confused.
And the naming is not formal.
Some of name is in lowercase, and other are uppercase.
