Bug 212711 A temp1AggFactory_xxx floder is not created in temp folder when runAndrender a report design including Aggregation
I use Engine RunAndRender task run a report which is including Aggregation.
I have set both java.io.tmpdir and EngineConfig temp folder.
When I run the task I found there is a folder like temp1AggFactory_20035600 created in superior folder of EngineConfig temp folder.
And the folder is empty.
I think if we created this folder we should created in the temp folder but not the superior folder right?
