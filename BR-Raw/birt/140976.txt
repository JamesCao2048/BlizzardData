Bug 140976 assert condition off by one in ReportEngineService
The following assertion appears around line 516 in org.eclipse.birt.report.viewerbirtWEB-INFclassesorgeclipsebirtreportservicesReportEngineService.java assert pageNumber > 0 && pageNumber < reportDocument.getPageCount( ); However, since page numbers start at 1 instead of 0, pageNumber could equal reportDocument.getPageCount(). So the assertion should be assert pageNumber > 0 && pageNumber <= reportDocument.getPageCount( );
