Bug 191696 WordUtil is getScreenResolution()-dependent
WordUtil class, in org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.emitter.wpml package, makes the following call to the getScreenResolution() method: public final static double INCH_PX = java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit ( ).getScreenResolution ( ); which makes it dependent on Java runtime being non-headless. When run on JVM with -Djava.awt.headless=true, an java.awt.HeadlessException is thrown. It makes impossible to use BIRT on non-X Linux environment. Maybe there should be a default value of INCH_PX variable?
