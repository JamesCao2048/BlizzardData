Bug 176875 BIRT viewer - WTP integration - web.xml file created has blank values
When you create a BIRT web project, the web.xml file has lot of blank default values, which is very confusing to understand.
Some users commented about it during the eclipse conference.
Suggestions 1) BIRT_VIEWER_WORKING_FOLDER
- set the default value 2) BIRT_VIEWER_MAX_ROWS
- Write a comment above, saying by default all rows are shown, also explain the user of this variable.
3) BIRT_RESOURCE_PATH
- This should specify the default value or atleast put a comment indicating where is it picked from.
This is very confusing.
4) General It would be good to put a onew line comment on all.
