Bug 154093 Performance problem when rendering a chart with 1800 datapoints
I'm having some performance issues when I render 1800 datapoints in a chart. Rendering 1800 data points in a table is fine. My report just contains a simple line chart that is bound to a csv file. The csv file contains 1800 datapoints. I will attach the report template file and csv file.
