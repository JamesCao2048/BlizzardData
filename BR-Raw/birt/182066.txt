Bug 182066 Enhancement for selet value list on dataset filter building dialog
Steps to reproduce: 1.New a dataset; 2.Double click the dataset to starts up dataset edit dialog; 3.Choose "Filters" option; 4.Press "New" button to starts up filter edit dialog; 5.Assigns an expression to the filter conditon instead of select a column value from the drop down list; 6.Choose a operator; 7.Press the arrow button to select the "<Select Value...>" option Expected result: Starts up the select value dialog and list the available values based on the assigned expression.
For example: Assign an expression: row["CITY"] + row["OFFICECODE"] Then the value list probably like: Tokyo01 NYC02 London03 ...
Actual result: Given a warning "Value list unavailable with given expression" I think this case can be supported.
