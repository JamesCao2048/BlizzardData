Bug 208863 Enhance BIRT jsp tag to render reportlet using bookmark.[0603]
Description: Enhance BIRT custom jsp tag to support render reportlet using bookmark. At present, user can only use reportlet attribute and instanceid value to get reportlet. But it's not easy for end-user to get instanceid value, so the more friendly way is to support like isreportlet and bookmark attributes. Thanks.
