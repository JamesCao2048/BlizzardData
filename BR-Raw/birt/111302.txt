Bug 111302 Output file handle remains open after engine is destroyed
I am running BIRT under the spring framework in Tomcat. This behavior is the same when running in Eclipse. I am creating a PDF file on disk. The file gets created, however, even though the engine has been destroyed, the file remains open. Since after the report is generated we are trying to email it and delete it, the email thread can't get access to the file to read or delete it. Adobe can't open it either. Once the process in Tomcat or Apache has terminated, the file is flushed and it's handle closed. Shouldn't the file handle be closed and the file resources released once the engine is destroyed?
