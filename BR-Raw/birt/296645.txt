Bug 296645 PDF emitter using bold Times New Roman instead of bold Lucida Sans.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091109 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.5 Build Identifier: M20090917-0800 I have a simple report with 2 data controls.
Both controls have the font Lucida Sans.
One is regular and the other is bold.
The report renders fine in the viewer, but in PDF (using the Run / As Pdf menu item), the bold font renders as Times New Roman.
I notice in my windowsfonts directory that Lucida Sans is a font family with 4 fonts in it, none with a font style of "bold".
The closest is "demibold roman".
My guess is that the viewer is smart enough to use demibold roman for bold but the PDF emitter isn't.
I've played around with the fontsConfig_pdf.xml file but the best I can do there is to to create an alias where I make some other existing font, such as Impact, become Lucida Sans Demibold Roman, which doesn't really accomplish what I want.
Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Create a report.
2.Assign Lucida Sans to a control and make it bold.
3.View the report as PDF.
Expected: Control appears as bold Lucida Sans.
Actual: Control appears as bold Times New Roman.
