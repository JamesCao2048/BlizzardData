Bug 182834 Cross Tab: Text used in layout should follow the mockup
Currently it shows: Row, Column and Measure. We need to re-word them according to the mockup for the sake of user friendliness: 1. it's more user friendly with a phrase of "Drop data field(s)..." to direct user what to do. 2. We tend to avoid addressing Measure/Dimension concept so we don't want to see word "Measure" on the layout.
