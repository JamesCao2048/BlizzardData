Bug 298456 Drill through problem when using reverse categories
Build Identifier: 20090619-0625 I have a report with a bar chart which shows a count of items. I've flipped the axes so bars are drawn horizontally and the associated data set returns the top X counts in order. I added a drill-through option to the chart so that clicking a bar will redirect to a report giving more information on that item. All worked well.... then.... I wanted to show the counts in order with the highest count at the top but by default the highest count appeared at the bottom - so I selected "Reverse Categories" for the X-axis. This seems to have broken the drill through. It looks like the reverse categories affects how the chart is drawn (i.e. counts appear in order with highest at top) but is ignored in the drill through. The chart shows the following bars: Bar1 Bar2 Bar3 . . Bar10 where Bar1 has the highest count and Bar10 the lowest. Clicking Bar1 drills through for Bar10 and vice versa. Clicking Bar2 drills through for Bar9 and vice versa, and so on. Reproducible:
Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Create Bar Chart from ordered data where X is categories and Y is an associated value. 2.Set up drill through on the chart series that uses the x value. Confirm the drill through works. 4.On the Format Chart tab choose the X-axis and select Reverse Categories and confirm the chart is being re-drawn with X axis categories reversed. 5.Re-test the drill through.
