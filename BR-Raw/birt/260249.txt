Bug 260249 Missing JavaScript error description in specific wrong expression
Birt 2.3.2 build 20090107 Steps to reproduce: 1.Create a new report design.
2.Add a data item.
3.Set the item's expression to BirtStr.left("abcdef",
-1) 4.View the report Expected result: org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.EngineException: There are errors evaluating script "BirtStr.left("abcd",
-1)": {1}.
Where {1} is replaced by the proper JavaScript issue.
Actual result: The {1} is not replaced and appears as is.
More information: For other expression errors, like for the expression abcdef, the JavaScript error will appear clearly.
The same problem exists when using the expression builder for a computed column, then previewing the data set.
