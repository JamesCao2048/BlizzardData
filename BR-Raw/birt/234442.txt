Bug 234442 Preview Classpath issue
When creating the classpath for the preview button in 2.3 RC1 the code is not adding the full path to classes defined in the current workspace. For example. If your workspace is located at c:myprojects and inside the workspace you have a report project (named myreports) and a java project for event handlers( named myjavaproj ). If your java project includes a lib called mylib.jar which is in the java project under the lib folder, what gets put in the url for the classpath when the preview button is selected is: file:/c:/myjavaproj/lib/mylib.jar and it should be file:/c:/myprojects/myjavaproj/lib/mylib.jar
