Bug 165188 logging per report
Setting up a dedicated (birt) report server, which serves all our web apps, leads to a logging desaster.
Birtegine logs all messages to one file.
There's no info which rptdesign caused the logmessage or who (e.g.
user) caused the logmessage.
Retrieving who/which rpt caused some logmessage is not possible! There are two possible solutions: (a) prefixing each logmessage with a userdefineable message (task.setLogprefix("myprefix")) (b) set an outputstream for each task (task.setLoggingOutputStream(outputstream)) to split the huge logfile to many small pieces.
