Bug 270451 Error accessing decimal field using JDBC and Sqlbase database
Hi.
I'm tryng to read data from a Sqlbase database (Unify) using JDBC.
I experienced a problem when any field in a table is decimal.
The following message appears: + Cannot get the decimal value from column: 3.Cannot get BigDecimal value in the result set.
SQL error #1: Unsupported method I run the same SQL istruction within a simple Java program using the same JDBC driver and the same database and it works.
Can anybody help me?
