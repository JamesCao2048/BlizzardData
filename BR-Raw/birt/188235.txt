Bug 188235 [Regression]Chart legend position is incorrect
Steps to reproduce: 1.Set plot width = 150; height = 150; 2.Set legend position = right; Expected result: Legend is in the right side of plot.
Actual result: Legend position is not plot left offset + plot width; but only plot width.
So plot and legend are overlapped together.
