Bug 110681 Reportlet
Web pages often use HTML tables instead to organize and position their content.
In order to provide more flexibility for integrating report content into the customer web pages, it becomes necessary to introduce a new set of formats that return content as Reportlets or partial DHTML pages.
These reportlets can then be included within web pages generated by the customers web application.
This project focuses on producing content that is easily embeddable within an overall HTML page.
