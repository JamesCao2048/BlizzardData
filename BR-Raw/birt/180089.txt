Bug 180089 BIRT model - TOC predefined styles
In ROM we need to support predefined styles for TOC too.
This will allow user to easily create a TOC style, by creating one of two styles.
Suggestion i have is
- TOC ( Applies to all TOC nodes )
- TOC-level1 ( If defined applies to first level toc nodes )
- TOC-level2 ...........
- TOC-level5
