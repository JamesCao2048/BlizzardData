Bug 174456 Chart label format is not applied to the value string.
1.Open the attached report template file 2.Modify the xml data source to point to the attache xml file.
3.Run Preview.
The pie chart label and tool tips shows "3800%, 97.44%".
It seems the value is multipled by 100 and a % character is appended.
I expected to see "38, 97.44%".
I used build BIRT 2.2.0.v20070212-0630.
