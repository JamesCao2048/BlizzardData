Bug 261160 [Enhancement] Auto-detect the data type of legend entries.
description: When we select different type of data for X/Y axis, the Edit Format dialog will select the corresponding format type automatically.
For example, if we select number type data for Y axis, the Edit Format will only display the Data Type Number.
But for legend entries, Edit Format does not auto-detect the data type and we need to select the data type mannually.
Hope this can be enhanced.
