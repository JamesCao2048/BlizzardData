Bug 189573 Remove the filter and group arguments of total functions from ROM.
Description: Currently, we can select the group and filter in aggregation builder, so the function's argument: group and filter are duplicate to be specify.
So after discuss with LinZhu and ZhiqiangQiang, we should remove the filter and group argument of total functions in ROM.
So that GUI will not use that argument to design the aggregation builder.
