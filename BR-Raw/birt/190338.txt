- Contribute Samples not localized OS: Linux only Build date: 20070530 Component name: BIRT Blocking: no Tester Name: Kamil Ignacak (PL) Steps to recreate the problem:
- open view Report And Chart Design
-> Report Examples
- select Contribute Samples Problem description: Contribute Samples is in English
- user will not know why there is no report description and why he should "submit a bugzilla entry at...
".
Changing a description (e.g.
to "Please consider sharing your own examples.
To do so submit a bugzilla entry at...") would also help a lot.
