Bug 301382 Add VIEWPORT meta tag in HTML output to support mobile device viewing
The VIEWPORT meta tag will allow compliant browsers to handle scaling of the page to best suit the area available for render. This is especially important in the mobile web. <meta name = "viewport" content = "width=${device-width}"> This is the syntax that is required. The spec for the tag supports fixed dimensions as well, but at a minimum we should implement the tag as it reads above.
