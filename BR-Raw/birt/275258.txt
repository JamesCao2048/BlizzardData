Bug 275258 Report Designer clears all type of error markers when opening/closing
The ReportDesigner clears all kinds of "org.eclipse.core.resources.problemmarker" of a file when opening or closing a rptdesign file in the editor.
(see IDEMultipageReportEditor.java) I have developed a special IncrementalProjectBuilder which checks the datasource/datasets definitions of all rptdesign files according to our company guidelines.
This builder will create a problem marker (subtype of "org.eclipse.core.resources.problemmarker") to inform the user, when a datasource/dataset is not properly defined.
But because of the global removing of all problem markers when opening/closing (IDEMultipageEditor.clearMarkers()) the editor, my problemmarkers are removed also until my builder will be called the next time.
Is it possible that the report designer will create a marker with a subtype of "org.eclipse.core.resources.problemmarker", so the deleting of markers will just delete these markers which were created by the report designer itself.
