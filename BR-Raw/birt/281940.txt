Bug 281940 Improve the usability of the aggregation function
Since the category grouping is enabled by default, SUM aggregation is set as default aggregation function. However, user may not know the categories are groupied and the Y values are aggregated, especially for constant value. Hence, we should improve the usability of the grouping and aggregation function so that it's more apparent to see them enabled or not. Following enhancements could be done with little UI change: 1. If aggregation function (such as SUM) is set to the query, the text field or combo should change the tooltip like this: SUM(row["name"]), rather than previous row["name"]. 2. If grouping is disabled, change the icon of grouping and sorting button. The icon could be current one appending a red cross. If grouping is enabled, the icon is the same with current one.
