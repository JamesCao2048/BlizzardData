Bug 259948 Difference on ReportDesignHandle between onPrepare and beforeFactory
I want to dynamically add columns on a Table.
I tried on the beforeFactory(...) method of ReportEventHandler and everything is alright.
Then I tried on the onPrepare(...) method of TableEventHandler with the same code but it didn't work.
In both case, I use the following code to get the TableHandle : (TableHandle) reportContext.getDesignHandle().findElement("myTableName") With the debugger, I saw that I have the same instance of reportContext in each method.
But the ReportDesignHandle behind is not the same...
I guess this is why I don't have the same final result.
I post this problem on the birt newsgroup and Jason ask me to log it as a bug.
Thanks.
