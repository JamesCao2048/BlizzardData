Bug 255837 Group sorting inconsistent when a sort condition is ascending
When all sort conditions are descending, I do not see any inconsistencies. I have attached an example report using the Classic Models database. Note the inconsistencies of the ascending sort conditions. Different combinations yield different results. In the first table, note that the MINQUANTITYORDERED sort seems to have no effect at all. If you swap the order of the sort conditions, it seems to have the reverse effect. In the second table, note that the group is sorted by FIRSTNAME descending, regardless of the position of the sort conditions. This is flagged as major because complex, dynamic sorting on a group is a requirement for our product release.
