Bug 216672 Java ScriptedDataSetEventHandler throws exception when DataSet has AnyType column
Build ID: M20071023-1652 Steps To Reproduce: 1.create a Scripted Data Set with column of type Any 2.create a Java event handler for tha data set 3.call setColumnValue(columnName, object) in fetch method.
(object is not null and not an object is is known by BIRT) 4.when it tries to fill up the second row it throws an exception, but the data types are the same of the objects of the column More information: DataRow class checks the object's type against DataType.AnyType class, but ReportObject's constructor does not use AnyType for the particular column from second row.
