Bug 260681 Allow JDBC driver manager dialog to add multiple jars at one time through FileDialog
Eclipse Build ID: I20081211-1908 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Go the JDBC driver manager dialog.
2.Press "Add" button to add new jar in the jar list.
3.Only one jar file can be added in at one time.
That is quite inconvinient for the user if he wants to add multiple jar files under the same folder.
So the jar file selection dialog should support multiple selection.
