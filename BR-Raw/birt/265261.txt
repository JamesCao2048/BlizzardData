Bug 265261 Enhancement of BIRT Classic Models Sample Database Driver location or locate strategy
Description: Currently, BIRT Classic Models Sample Database's driver is located in eclipsepluginsorg.apache.derby.core_10.3.1.4.It is build related.
Because I always change my build and use one workspace.
Every time I always found the problem if I change the build, it told me the "Unable to locate JAR/zip in file system as specified by the driver definition: xxxxeclipsepluginsorg.apache.derby.core_10.3.1.4derby.jar".
If I want to connect BIRT Classic Models Sample Database I must modify the driver location.
So I suggest can its location be workspace related?
Or can we found the driver in the plug-ins based on the current build dynamically?
Build number: 2.5.0.v20090218-0930 Steps to reproduce: 1, Install BIRT in folder A and start BIRT in a workspace 2, Install another BIRT in folder B and start BIRT by using the same workspace 3, Go to Data Source Explorer and Test Connection of BIRT Classic Models Sample Database Actual result: If build location is changed, test connection will be failed because it is unable to locate the driver.
