Bug 193675 Crosstab border doesn't refresh correctly when undo delete predefined style operation
Add a predefined style "crosstab "in report design, set some border styles, drag a crosstab to layout, it will apply the style automatically.
Then delete the predefined style, crosstab is refreshed correctly in layout, but if undo this operation, crosstab doens't refesh corrently.
This is because the border layer for crosstab is not updated correctly when refresh figure.
The resolution is we trigger a relayout after refresh figure to update border data correctly.
