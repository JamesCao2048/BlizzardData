Bug 208373 Auto resize Chart to have a single axis without blank
When Chart is within Cross tab, chart axis image should have a single axis only, but there may be much blank in other area.
Chart engine should auto resize the image to have the axis with fit size.
Meanwhile, report engine should not set size for chart image.
