Bug 180249 BPS39 - Centralized Chart Engine API
Centralized and clearer Engine API
-Create one single entry point class ChartEngine in an api package so it's easy to find (with access to IGenerator, Serializer, Device Renderers)
-Create a new IGenerator interface instead of exposing the Generator class.
