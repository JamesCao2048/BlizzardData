Bug 115938 Issues in the Library feature
The following issues are noticed
- Cannot add report items to container report items in layout of a library As a result user cannot add labels or text items to a grid/table item.
- In the library spec, there is no plan for separate library perspective, but the actuate implementation has a separate library perspective.
- If a report design does not include a library, and if a user tries to drag a report item from the library exploer to report design, the user should be provided the option to include hte library.
