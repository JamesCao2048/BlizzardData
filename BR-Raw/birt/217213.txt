Bug 217213 Javascript debug in first report will affect the second[0801]
Description: Javascript debug in first report will affect the second Build number:2.3.0.v20080131 Steps to reproduce: 1. New a report with event handler and get attached report. 2. Switch to debug perspective. 3. New debug configuration "event" under Report node in Debug dialog, select report with event handler and add the java project, tick on javascript in debug type, click Apply and close. 4. New another debug configuraion "script" under Report node, select attached report, tick on javascript in debug type, click Debug. 5. Click Cancel in the pararameter dialog. 6. Debug "event". Expected result: Debug in step6 should not pop up parameter dialog since there're no parameters in side. Actual result: Debug "event" will pop up parameter dialog which belongs to "script" report debug. It seems some information in the first debug process isn't cleaned. Error log:n/a
