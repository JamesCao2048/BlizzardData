Bug 161017 output columns not refreshed after schema change
I have following data set: select * from assertion_result where result_data_id=?
Output columns contained cca 7 values and I designed some report.
Another developer introduced new columns in this table so I reopened the report to update it.
Schema browser in Query "tab" is updated and I can see new columns in my table.
When I click on Preview results "tab", I can see new columns there too.
But when I click on Output columns "tab", then there are still only old columns and no new columns despite the fact, that I have * in my sql query.
I tried to click on Cache preferences "tab" and press on Clear cache button (check box is turned off) but it didn't help.
I have another data set, which is join of two tables and there is another issue, that may be caused by same issue.
The SQL query is: select T.*, R.* from validation_task T, resources R where T.id=?
and T.bp=R.id One column is named endtime and it occurs once in both tables.
It was used in Computed columns "tab" and worked fine.
But now it is displayed in Preview results as id_9, while Output columns still holds endtime column and id_9 was column for second table (both tables have PK column id).
The computed column now does not work, it says that second value is null.
