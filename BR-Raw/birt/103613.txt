Bug 103613 Linking chart by parameter causes error when a NULL param value is reached
I have a chart embedded in a group and linked by a single parameter (datatype is string). This group is actually a subgroup of one or more groups. So there may not always be data for the group, and thus no parameter value for the chart. When this happens (when there is no data for the group), I get this error message: There are errors on the report page: - There are error(s) in Chart:null Error0 : data.engine.NullDefaultInParamValue(1 time)detail: Default value for input parameter cannot be null.Error1 : Error.ExtendedItemRenderingError(1 time)detail: There are problems(s) rendering Chart extended item .The DataSet bound to the chart returned no rows. I think this would be a common/expected occurence that should not raise an error, but rather the query should just be skipped.
