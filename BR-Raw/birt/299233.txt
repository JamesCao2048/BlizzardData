Bug 299233 Problem with the ReportEngine_<date>.log
Hi, I have a problem with the ReportEngine_<date>.log in windows 2003 Server. The problem is that it doesn't update the file modification date, and the file will not part then I have files too large(600MB or more...). Can anyone help me? thanks a lot.
