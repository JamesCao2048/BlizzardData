Bug 142893 Text key not found when library and report use different resource files
The following scenario was tested with BIRT 2.1RC2:
- New library, assign resource file "r1.properties" which contains key/value-pair "k1=v1"
- New label in library, set text key of label to "k1"
- New report, assign resource file "r2.properties" which does not contain key/value-pair "k1=v1"
- Drag and drop label from library to report body
- Preview Expected result:
- Report shows "v1" Actual result:
- Report shows nothing.
If key/value-pair "k1=v1" is added to r2.properties, than "v1" is shown.
