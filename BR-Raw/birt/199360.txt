Bug 199360 Provide new servlet to retrieve html fragment when in reportlet mode
Currently in reportlet mode, the framesset servlet will still wrap and return all ajax viewer code.
We need a new servlet to return only html fragment generated by engine.
Then this fragment can be further parsed by client side according to user's requirement.
