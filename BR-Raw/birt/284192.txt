</response_by> Build: 20090720-1600 Language: French Steps to reproduce: 1) Expand BIRTproject in the Navigator, right click on Test_Report_4.rptdesign and select Open.
2) Double click on the chart that is displayed in the Design View.
3) Click the Format Chart tab.
4) Expand the Chart Area node in the left panel.
5) Click Legend in the left panel.
6) Check the boxes next to the words Visible.
7) Click the Layout button.
the last item in the panel "Title percent" is missing a colon sign to be consistent with the other items.
I also have a question for this string: By the way what is intended by "Title percent", does it mean Percentage of the title (the size of the title in %) ?
Thanks a lot in advance for your answer, Martine Thanks for c
