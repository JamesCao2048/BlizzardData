Bug 181355 Cross tab layout behavior
- add a cross tab item
- try to drag and drop a level from the cube( in data explorer ) into the cross tab layout Currently this is not supported.
User can only drag dimension nodes.
Expected behavior
- User should be able to drag level nodes too, this should actually add dimension to the cross tabl row/column area
