Bug 122480 It is difficult to edit the properties of a library root element with Property Editor
Open a library. The Property Editor shows the properties of the library's root element. Click on any item in the Data Explorer, Palette, or Outline. The Property Editor shows the appropriate properties or is blank. Click on the library root element in the Outline. The Property Editor blanks. Click on the dark gray area outside the white or gray rectangle in the main editor window. The Property Editor shows the properties of the library's root element. Expected: Clicking on the library root element in the Outline shows the properties of the library's root element in the Property Editor. Click on the dark gray area outside the white or gray rectangle in the main editor window shows a blank Property Editor.
