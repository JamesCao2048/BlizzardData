Bug 116744 Dynamic text content type has no effect
I have a db field with three types of content: 1) HTML text within
<html> ...</html> tag.
2) HTML fragments not within
<html> tag 3) Text with RTF tags I use a dynamic text element to display the contents of this field.
The report displays the same results whether I set the dynamic text element's Content Type property to Auto, Plain, or HTML.
Expected results: For Plain, I expect the literal content (tags and all) to be displayed.
For Auto, I expect content 1, 2 and 3 to appear properly without HTML or RTF tags.
For HTML, I expect content 1 and 2 to appear properly without HTML tags, and content 3 to appear literally with RTF tags.
See attached report.
