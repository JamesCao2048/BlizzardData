Bug 217111 Links not distinguishable in PDF reports
I have installed TCR 1.1.1.When I generate a PDF report, the links in the resulting report are not underlined or highlighted in any way so you know that the links exist.
I was expecting them to be simimular to the HTTP reports, where the links are underlined and are a different colr.
