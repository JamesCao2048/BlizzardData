Bug 214572 Implement IAggregationCellViewProvider for crosstab/chart integration
This interface implements the model logic for the designer UI, when the users design a crosstab with charts.
Note that it is independent from the multi-view feature.
/** * Return the name of this view */ String getViewName( ); // this should simply return "chart" /** * Returns if the given aggregation cell matches this view */ boolean matchView( AggregationCellHandle cell ); Returns true if chart is supported in this type of aggregation cell /** * Switches given aggregation cell to this view */ void switchView( AggregationCellHandle cell ); create a chart inside the aggregation cell (and remove the data elements).
This method is called when the UI tries to switch the cell contents from data element to chart.
/** * Restores given aggregation cell to previous view */ void restoreView( AggregationCellHandle cell );
