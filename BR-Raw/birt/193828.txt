Bug 193828 message should not be popped when adding group level to cross tab
In a cross tab click on an aggregation type data cell and select 'show/hide Group Levels'.
If I want to add a level, A message dialog pops up.
Expected: No message dialog should pop up when adding a level.
The dialog should appear only when a level in unchecked.
