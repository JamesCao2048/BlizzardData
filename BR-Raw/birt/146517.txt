Bug 146517 support extensible new report output formats
User can create new report emitters to support new report output formats.
But right now, many part of the BIRT UI (designer, and report viewer), drill thru bookmark syntax, assume the report output format to be a fix list.
Need to walk thru end to end how to add new report output format, and how user can create bookmark and drill thru links to a customer report output format.
