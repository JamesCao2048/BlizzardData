Duplicate Entry in CVS Compare
While using WSDD 5.5, which is built on Eclipse 2.0.2, I saw the following strange behavior: I was comparing the contents of selected packages with those in the CVS repository. You can see from the attached screen shot that a difference appeared twice when it should have appeared once. Note that I am using CVS on Windows, which might have something to do with this, but I have no way of telling.
