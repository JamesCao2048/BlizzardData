[Navigator] file icons are not updated when file associations are modified.
I20031203
1. launch Eclipse on a new workspace
2. create a project
3. create a file named 'test1.xml'
The new file is displayed with the default (text) file icon.
4. associate '*.xml' files to the ant editor in
window>preferences>workbench>file associations
5. create a file named 'test2.xml'
The new file is displayed with the ant file icon, test1.xml is still displayed
with the default file icon.
Closing/re-opening the view solves the problem.
