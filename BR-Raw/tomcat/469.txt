Wrong Number of Arguments produced by starter program
When starting Eclipse under Redhat 9 with Sun J2SDK 1.4.2_03 the starte program ./eclipse seems to produce a call to the java-environment wirh too many arguments (perhaps not taking into account the difference between windows and unix 
- latter gives the name of the procedure called, too).
The messages in the java-webstart-window exception window is: TooManyArgumentsException[ Zu viele Argumente angegeben: {-cp, /tmp/javawH8XtI1, org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main, 
-os, linux, 
-ws, gtk, 
-arch, x8
