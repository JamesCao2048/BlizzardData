[osgi] Align EclipseStarter and Launcher
Sure a minor issue, but I didn't want to end up fogetting this...
It looks like EclipseStarter should not be in the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor. As far as I could see, it is completely
independent on the framework adaptor in use. The current situation suggests the
contrary.
