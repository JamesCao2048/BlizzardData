[Problems] Problems view is selected automatically and flashy
This is for integration view 200403100800. Using a Java perspective I select a project. The Problems shows up selected. I click on other views, the Problems view is still selected. Only when I select the Problems view, then another view is deselected. I have a filter on the problems, to show only the problems on any resource of the selected project.
