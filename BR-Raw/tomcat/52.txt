[Progress] showBusyCursorWhile doesn't reset cursor
There are two issues with the implementation of this method that could be fixed.
First, the way the it's currently implemented the busy cursor will only return to be un-busy after a predetermined 5 seconds.
Even if the runnable finishes quickly the cursor has this weird delay.
I suggest adding a hook so that the busy loop terminates when the runnable completes.
Also, if an exception occurs in #scheduleProgressMonitorJob() the busy flag is not reset and the loop in busycursorWhile won't complete.
