Additional fixes for porting SWT to 64-bit
Creating separate bug as requested in bug 37775 .
I have made additional changes to SWT-N20040228 to address some problems occuring when using SWT on the amd64 platform.
With the patches attached I am now able to get the first window of Eclipse-N20040228 up and running.
There are all kinds of fixes, including changes in the glue .c files 
- although I understand these are automatically generated?
There are changes made to parameters, return values, size constants and pointer arithmetics using the same standard as the other changes ( int 
-> long /*int*/ ).
btw, I was thinking that being able to get conversion warnings from both C and Java compilers when an implicit conversion from int to long is taking place would be of great help, wouldn't it?
Wouldn't that pinpoint possible problem areas?
Anyways, I plan to continue with getting Eclipse going on 64-bit.
If I come up with new patches, should I attach them here as well or open a new bug?
