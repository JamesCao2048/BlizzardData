UI generation problems, JVM Terminating while using Hyades
Found using WSWB 3.0 M8 driver + Eclipse Hyades 3.0 20040309_1448 driver.
Steps to reproduce: 
------------------- 1.Start Eclipse.
2.Open the Profiling and Logging perspective.
3.Select Run 
-> Profile...
4.Double click on External Java Application to create a new configuration.
5.On the right hand side, click on the Profiling tab.
6.In the section labelled "Select a profiling set:", select "Memory Analysis".
7.Click on the Close button to close this dialog.
When you are prompted to sve changes, select NO.
8.Select Run 
-> Profile...
9.Select the configuration that was just created earlier.
10.On the right hand side, click on the Profiling tab.
When I do that, the two "tables" seems to look very different, like there were problems generating those two widgets.
If you try to resize the dialog box, Eclipse will freeze, then crash, giving a JVM Terminated message.
