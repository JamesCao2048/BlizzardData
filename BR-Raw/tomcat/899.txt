IncompatibleClassChangeError at runtime when compiling with -1.4 option
So we finally figured what changed between 3.0M3 and 3.0M4: the Java Compiler options changed to having 1.4 compliance as the default for generated class files. (We found this out through the circuitous route of inspecting the class file attributes of an M4 compile vs a working command-line one. The optimisation to swizzle JoinPoint for JoinPointStaticPart fails when ajc is passed the -1.4 option, resulting in an IncompatibleClassChangeError at runtime. Test case about to be checked into ajcTestsFailing.... and then we'll see if we can fix it!
