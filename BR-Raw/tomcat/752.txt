starting text inside the control block of a multi-line if statement gets deleted when typing the opening brace
I've noticed that when I try to add braces around the contents of statements 
preceded by an if statement, some of the code gets erased.

In terms of eclipse preferences, I am using 2 spaces for tabs, and I have 
turned off the 'close braces' typing feature. For new lines, my preferences 
are set to insert new lines before an opening brace, inside control statements 
and inside an empty block. New line between elseif is disabled, and clearing 
blank lines is enabled.

The bug can be reproduced using the following example:

public class Foo
{
  public void foo1()
  {
    if ( 123456789 == 123456789 )
    |<- put a brace here.
      System.out.println("foo1 true");
  }
  
  public void foo2()
  {
    if ( 123456789 == 123456789 &&
         123456789 == 123456789 && 123456789 == 123456789 &&
         123456789 == 123456789 && 123456789 == 123456789 )
    |<- put a brace here.
      System.out.println("foo2 true");
  }
  
  public void foo3()
  {
    if ( 123456789 == 123456789 &&
                                   123456789 == 123456789 )
    |<- put a brace here.
      System.out.println("foo3 true");
  }
}

Obviously, the '|<- put a brace here.' should be deleted prior to inserting 
the braces... :-)

Here is the output caused by eclipse when I type an opening brace '{' at the 
positions indicated above:

public class Foo
{
  public void foo1()
  {
    if ( 123456789 == 123456789 )
    {
      System.out.println("foo1 true");
  }
  
  public void foo2()
  {
    if ( 123456789 == 123456789 &&
         123456789 == 123456789 && 123456789 == 123456789 &&
         123456789 == 123456789 && 123456789 == 123456789 )
         {   System.out.println("foo2 true");
  }
  
  public void foo3()
  {
    if ( 123456789 == 123456789 &&
                                   123456789 == 123456789 )
                                   {3 true");
  }
}

As you can see, foo1 works fine, but foo2 causes the brace to be moved to the 
right and lumped together with the first line.

foo3 is the example where some of the text [System.out.println("foo] actually 
gets deleted . It seems as though putting the extra spaces at the beginning of 
the second line of the if statement makes things worse...

Well, let me know if you need any more info to fix this, I didn't find this 
bug documented anywhere else...
