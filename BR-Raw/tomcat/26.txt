ExtendedDataElement name should be unique
For the 'name' property of the ExtendedDataElement the CBE spec says "This name MUST be unique with respect to all other fields at the same level of e
xtendedDataElement hierarchy".
This is not being enforced by event validation.
In other words, I am able to create two EDEs with the same name.
Related to this problem are the 'getExtendedDataElements(String)' and the 'getChildren(String)' methods.
These methods should not return a List but rather a single element, also they should probably be renamed to getExtendedDataElement(String) and getChil
d(String).
