Once the number of editors becomes sufficiently large, the editorlist dropdown shows up.
But when I click on it, the lightweight popup which shows the list of currently open editors seems to extend beyond the screen.
I will attach a screen shot.
The list should be scrollable and visible on the screen at all times, in the event of multi-monitor it should be on the same monitor as it's associate
