[Contexts] Renamed EnabledSubmission to ContextSubmission
The type EnabledSubmission would be better named ContextSubmission.
Clients browsing for context-related APIs generally look for types named *context*.
Since the name has no relation to contexts, it's difficult to remember.
And lastly, the name is almost oxymoronic.
While the API may say "add" and "remove" EnabledSubmissions, clients logically think of this as enabling and disabling the submissions.
Just saying "then we disable our EnabledSubmission" makes my head hurt.
:) I think it's cleaner to call them ContextSubmissions, because that's what clients are really doing 
- submitting a context.
