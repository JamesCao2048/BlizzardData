Configurator should filter out faetures not applicable to current environment
The update configurator creates the first platform.xml by picking up the most
recent version of all the features present on the local site.
However, features with OS/WS/etc settings not applicable to the current
environment should be filtered out.
Note that this not happen now because each eclipse drop is for a particular
environment, but it is a possible scenario.
