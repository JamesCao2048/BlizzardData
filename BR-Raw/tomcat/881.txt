overspecified directory path by "eclipse" when exporting a feature
Hi Eclipse Team
Eclipse : Version: 2.1.1 Build id: 200306271545
Java    : version "1.4.1_02"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.1_02-b06)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.1_02-b06, mixed mode)
When exporting a feature to a zip file, the generated path includes
the "eclipse" prefix. While it is ok for a feature added to the Eclipse IDE, it
precludes to unzip the zipped feature in the "right" features & plugins
directories when used with an IDE based on Eclipse but whose name and master
directory is not "eclipse" but "foobar" with sub directories:
foobar/features
foobar/plugins
Thus, in my opinion, one should remove the "eclipse" prefix for  an easier way
of use and an a greater generality of the export process.
Regards
