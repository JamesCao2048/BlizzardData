Decoration process is very slow
When I disconnect, refresh, and then reshare my project, the decoration
process takes a very long time.  I have ~3000 files in one directory and it
seems to process these at a rate slow enough that I can see each file name crawl
by.
It has been decorating this directory for the past 13 minutes.  This is on a p4
2.4 with 1gig ram.  I am running nothing else cpu intensive.
