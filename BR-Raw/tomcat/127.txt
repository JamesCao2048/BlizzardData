Updating through http proxy (almost) locks PC with 100% CPU usage
I've correctly specified the http proxy for updates, which requires authentication (NTLM by default, although has also worked with basic for other applications, Java and non-Java) on a different domain than the client or proxy.
Non-NTLM authentication requires the "AUTH-DOMAINusername" format for the username.
As soon as the updater requires some http communication, the java process hits 100% cpu usage, severely crippling other processes (i.e.
they're "as slow as molasses in January").
This continues indefinitely unless Cancel is pressed.
