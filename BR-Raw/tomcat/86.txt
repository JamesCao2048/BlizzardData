Merge does not see files/dirs deleted in stream where changes come from
I'm using build I200403171300. I want to merge a specific stream (branch JDK_1_5) of a project starting from the version where the branch was created (Root_JDK_1_5) with changes made in HEAD stream. After the merge is done, I can see all created and modified files displayed in synchronize view but not files (or dirs) which were deleted in HEAD... Set severity to major as it's really painful to identify each time I merge (every 2 days) all files deleted in HEAD stream and delete them manually in my JDK_1_5 workspace after the merge...
