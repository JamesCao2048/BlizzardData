generating getters and setters puts 1 line of whitespace at bottom instead of top
when i generate my getters and setters, the first line of generated code is directly under the existing code, and the last line of generated code has 
a line of whitespace under it.
this is the opposite of what i would expect.
i'd expect 1 line of whitespace before the generated code and none below.
my 'insert point' is 'last method'.
