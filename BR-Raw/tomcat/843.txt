add to javadoc for List.remove(int start, int end)
The method remove(int start, int end) in class List, removes any items that it
can before throwing the exception ERROR_INVALID_RANGE. This should be added to
the javadoc as this behavior is specifically tested in the junit test
Test_org_eclipse_swt_widgets_List.test test_removeII()
