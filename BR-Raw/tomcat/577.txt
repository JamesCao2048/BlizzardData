[PropertiesView] allow property pages to handle multi select
The current PropertyPage system is hard wired to only allow a single selection.
It would be nice if it was similar to the popupmenu system - this allows
multiple selections and works out common things between the selection.
I know this is not a trivial thing to provide - but I thought I put in the
suggestion.
Example of use - select multiple files and set readonly on them all.
Very useful in RCP apps (select multple product items and change discount%)
