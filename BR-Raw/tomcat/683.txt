[SSH2] JSchException: channel is not open
Thanks for a great plug-in it works just fine under Windows,
but on Linux I experience a problem:
It works when Eclipse is started, but when I have not used the cvs
connection for a while (10-20 minutes maybe?). I get the following error:
Authentication error: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: channel is not opened
Seems I have to restart Eclipse to make it work again.
