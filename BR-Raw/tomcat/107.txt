Unable to check out a folder in CVS as a java project
I am unable to checkout a particular folder from CVS as a java project. It does not give me the option to
use the wizard when i choose check out as. This happens only to this one folder, other folders can be
checked out as Java projects.
What is preventing this one folder from being checked out using the wizard?
I do not see any messages in the log that indicates a problem
