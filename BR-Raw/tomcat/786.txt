SETUP: My setup is a little complex.

I'm running Eclipse 2.1.2 with CDT 1.2 on Windows XP.
I have a current cygwin installation (as of 2003-12-4) and prc-tools 2.3 installed (< http://prc

I'm running from a drive (K:) that's mapped to my Documents directory (C:Documents and SettingsKeith Rollin.PALMSOURCEMy Documents).
My workspace (K:ProjectsEclipseplugins) is outside of my Eclipse directory (K:Downloadseclipse2.1.2eclipse).
I launch Eclipse with a shortcut that specifies the following command line: K:Downloadseclipse2.1.2 eclipseeclipse.exe 
-data k:ProjectsEclipseplugins.
My runtime workspace is in the normal location relative to the main workspace (K:ProjectsEclipseruntime-workspace).
I am using the Eclipse for Palm OS
