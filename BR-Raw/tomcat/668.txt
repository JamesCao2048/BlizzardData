[plan item] IBM-Rational Managed Build Enhancements
This is a partial SRS for the managed build system for the CDT 2.0 release. A
long list of requirements was compiled based on feedback we received from a
number of end users. However, there were simply too many suggestions for us to
implement in the time we have allocated to this release. This document
describes the requirements that we feel are important to the end-user
experience and that should be considered for the next release of the managed
build system. That said, the requirements that are not on the short list are
all valid, and if some other partner wishes to contribute the work, then they
can also be considered for the release.
