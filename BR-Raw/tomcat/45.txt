[Viewers] Outline popup flickers with decorators on
I20040322

1) Open an editor on a class file for which there was no attached source (I used
Throwable.class)
2) Hit Ctrl+o to open content outline popup
3) Type the letter "p" to narrow the set of listed methods.

Expected: narrow down member list to only show those with prefix "p"
Actual: All methods disappear from list (even those starting with "p", but all
fields remain.
