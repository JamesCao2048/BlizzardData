ClassCastException when opening default log view
I'm not sure if this is for UI component, or if it should go to one of the model components, so please re-set the component if I got it wrong.
Steps: 
------ 1.Run HelloWorld logging example 
- Add "My Logger" logging agent 
- Profile HelloWorld.class example.

- Hit enter in the console to terminate execution.
2.Click on the Open Log View toolbar button in the Profiling perspective to open the log view.
After clicking on the Open Log View toolbar button, I see this in the .log file: !ENTRY org.
