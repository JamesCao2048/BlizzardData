Ctrl+Space gives two key down events
On Windows XP using I20030923, "Ctrl+Space" gives two key down events.
This key binding is used by Eclipse for code assist.
Affects keys preference page, and causes a flicker as the code assist is executed twice.
If the key is bound to any other command, it can make the command completely unusable.
Problem does not occur on Linux-GTK.
This is required for M4.DOWN: stateMask=0x0, keyCode=0x40000, character=0x0 '0' DOWN: stateMask=0x40000 CTRL, keyCode=0x20, character=0x20 ' ' DOWN: stateMask=0x40
