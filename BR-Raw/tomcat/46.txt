[Sharing Wizard] Must improve handling of failed communications
Currently, if failures occur while populating a page, the next page is shown
even though it's contents are not available. We need to override WizardDialog
to prevent the next page from being shown.
Also, MVM saw some weirdness involving infinite prompts with invalid repo
specs. This should be tested thouroughly.
