wrong tasks shows as result of compilation.
when compiling a project, 1st four tasks appear in task bar which are not
related to any compilation error.
for example, the 4th task has description : [from Tb5DataSource.cpp] , which is
simply a part of the raw gcc compilation message. - in short, it seems parsing
of compilation messages is wrong.
