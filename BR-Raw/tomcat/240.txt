Workspace plugins ignored when relative path of workspace given
I am doing self-hosting where my dev-ide is I20040226, and my target-ide is I20040226 (seperate directories).
When I launch my development workspace with the 
-data 
<ws location> option, the plugins which I have in my workspace are being ignored if I specify the relative location of 
<ws location>.
It works fine when I specify the absolute path for 
<ws location>.
When the development workspace is launched with the relative path, and I launch the target from it, I get the following message in my console : Ignoring bundle at: reference:file:/VE_3.0_M7/org.eclipse.myplugin Ignoring bundle at: reference:file:/VE_3.0_M7/org.eclipse.myplugin.A ..
etc.
and sure enough the plugins dont show up in the launched target.
This works fine when I specify the absolute path to the 
<ws location>.
