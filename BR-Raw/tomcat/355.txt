[Graphics] Non-transparent icons
Build 3.0M7 There are quite a number of instances where view icons have a white background instead of a transparent one (e.g. problems, cvs repo, search, console, navigator, pkg explorer, ...). Is the plan to make them transparent ? Which would likely fit best in new look, or rather have all transparent ones become white backgrounded (e.g. progress, javadoc, error log, declaration, ...) ?
