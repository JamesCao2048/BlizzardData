Dependent updates are not discoverable
Updates that "require" another update are not displayed in the "Available Updates" dialog. Only the first update is shown to the user, even though the second update is also pertinent to his/her product. As a result, users must continue to press the "New Updates" action until it displays the "no updates available" message. Requirement: user should be made aware that they need to return to this action for more updates. Alternatively, they should be able to select "any/all" update (s) which would then be installed in the proper order.
