uppercase ZIP and JAR classpath entries ignored
From bug 45897 : 
----- The JDT's ..batch.FileSystem() constructor only accepts lowercase .zip and .jar and silently ignores other entries, which affects any such entry
 on the classpath.
(Java and Javac both handle uppercase-suffixed files fine.) Test case checked in, uses libraries org.aspectj/modules/tests/bugs/extdirs/lib/uppercase.

----- This is a bug in the jdt batch compiler.
This bug should be raised against org.eclipse.jdt.core.
When they fix it we'll pick up their fix.
