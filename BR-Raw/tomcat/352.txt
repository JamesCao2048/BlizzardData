[Workbench] Inconsistency in tool bar icons (visual language inconsistency)
I20040218 We are using different icons for similar things: 
- Red cross 'x': Navigator: delete item Part tabs: close tab Problems: delete Tasks: delete 
- Minus '-' / multiple stacked minus Console: remove all Search view: remove one, remove all 
- Eraser: Console: clear console Especially the '-' is problematic.
It is hard to recognize as a '-' if there is no '+' nearby.
In additon what is the semantic difference between a delete 'x' and a remove '-' ?
