debug view opens while prompting for perspective change
Preference settings:

* prompt for perspective switch when launching
* prompt for perspective switch when suspending
* activate debug view when breakpoint is hit

when I launch & hit a breakpoint immediately, I get one prompt to change to 
the debug perspective, but a debug view opens in my current perspective before 
I switch since I have a preference on to "activate the debug view". It feels 
like this should wait for prompting to complete, as the whole reason I want to 
swtich perspectives is to avoid having the debug view open in non-debug 
perspectives.
