message flashing in launch dialog
The launch config type messages/descriptions flash as I move from one config to the next, even though the message does not change.
I realize this is likely due to the dialog updaing/refreshing as a new config is selected, but we should try to avoid changing the message to "blank" and then back to the same thing.
