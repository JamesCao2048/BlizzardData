Current Update Manager unacceptable for new users
Currently the new user using the update manager for installing has to install 3 components separately.
This is unacceptable for the following reasons: 
-no guidelines on the order of installing the components (ambiguous to the user) 
-there 15 ways to install the CDT components for testing even though 12 of them does not make any sense.

-you cannot create a C/C++ project if you are installing only the CDT (managed and standard projects are only available by installing the build components) 
-there is a Component ID error when installing only the CDT and Managed Build components Suggestion: 
-for users, one package to install is the best way.
This has to be done soon so that we can have time to test the customer scenario before release.
