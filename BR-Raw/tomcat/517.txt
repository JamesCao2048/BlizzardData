Ant build not working with Ant 1.5
It seems to me that the integration build I20040121 is not working with Ant 1.5 anymore.
With M6 everything works fine.
I've set ANT_HOME in the Preferences as well as in the .launch file to my own ANT_HOME directory (Ant 1.5) Excerpt from .log: !MESSAGE Could not find one or more classes: "org.apache.tools.ant.
DemuxInputStream".
Please check the Ant classpath.
