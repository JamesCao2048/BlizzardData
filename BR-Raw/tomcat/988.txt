Eclipse 3.0 M3 - can't start Eclipse from the command line
OS 10.2
Eclipse 2.1 could be started from a shell using something like
/<....>/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse

In Eclipse 3.0 M3, Eclipse started this way is not properly initialized and 
can't be used (no event etc.).

Is there any way to workaround this?
