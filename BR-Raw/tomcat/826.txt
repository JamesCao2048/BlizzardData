[plan item] Rename Refactoring
This feature represents our first foray into the world of refactoring.
This includes bringing in a refactoring framework that is very similar to the JDT's refactoring framework.
The focus is then on rename refactoring which will leverage off and make improvements to the C/C++ Search feature to correctly refactor the references.
