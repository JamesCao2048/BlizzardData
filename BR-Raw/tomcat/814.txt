Deadlock with CVS job
Build: I-20031113 I went to the PDE > Compilers preference page, and checked the 'generate doc' checkbox on the schemas tab.
I was then prompted for a full build.
I said yes.
Then a deadlock with CVS was detected.
I'm not sure if this is PDE, Core or Team, so I'm arbitrarily assigning it to Core and cc'ing Mike and John A.
Two stacks below: Error Nov 18, 2003 18:54:09.509 Deadlock detected.
All locks owned by thread Worker-7 will be suspended.
