Autobuild kicks in and stops
Build: I-20031029
Fresh workspace. No classpath containers, no nothing.
Import org.eclipse.ui and all its pre-reqs as source.
The projects are all imported successfully.  All the classpaths are set
correctly.  Then autobuild starts, and abruptly ends.  You will see 1-2
warnings and that is it.
Invoke a full build manually, and you will see all warnings, etc. and
everything will be fine.
