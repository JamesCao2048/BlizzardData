Version diff should check for cancel before opening compare editor
build I20030718

- in the new sync view, double-clicked on an outgoing change
- hit the cancel button
- the compare editor opened anyway

In terms of timing, it was close, but I feel that I did complete the cancel 
just before the editor opened.  

Perhaps most of the work is going on during the openEditor call, in which case 
there's no support currently to back out of it.  However, if the work is done 
before the openEditor call, it should check isCanceled just before opening.
