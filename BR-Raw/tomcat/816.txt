working set filter for Breakpoints view
Please add different sorting options (including per-project sort).
Please add an option to enable and disable break point, enable and disable hit
count and enable or disable condition without opening breakpoint properties
dialog (i.e. by making this view as a table and showing those properties as a
checkboxes).
It will make it much convenient to control break points. Especially if this
will be implemented  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41058
