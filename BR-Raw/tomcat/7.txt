Clicking on the x for error correction hangs
I am using eclipse to write a plug in project. I write a method that does not
exist in a class. I get an error and the x appears on the file's border. I
click on it, and it suggests either replacing that method name with another
one, or creating that method in the class. I chose to create that method. 5
minute later, the method has not been created, eclipse freezes, and shows me
the "Application Not Responding" in the eclipse title. I kill the job, and
launch eclipse again. Go back to the x, chose create method, and it works fine.
Then I decide to create another method, and same problem happens. I had to
kill eclipse and start it over. Then it works fine.
And I use the x to create a method for a 3 rd time. Same problem.
No error log was created.
It also seems that the Problems table is not updated until I actually open a
project file. It only shows me 1 warning, and then populates all the errors
and other warnings as I open one of my project's java files.
I am using:
Eclipse Platform
Version: 3.0.0
Build id: 200403240010
