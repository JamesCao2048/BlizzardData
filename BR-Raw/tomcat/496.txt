Create patch omits parts of the source file
When creating the patch for bug 50655 , parts of my change were omitted from the patch. The same problem occurred with various patches in bug 44443 . In all cases, the contents of a newly inserted switch(...) statement were omitted from the patch. Attached is the patch that was generated for bug 50655 . The "new" directory contains the changed code, the "old" directory contains the versions in CVS, and the *.txt file is the patch that was generated. Notice that the patch is missing the contents of the switch statement on the first page.
