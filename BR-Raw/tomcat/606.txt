problems during CVS team -> unedit
Hi,
When I try to use the unedit feature during CVS "teamplay" (after I have
demolished my code ;-)), I get the following error pop-up:
"Problems encountered while moving recources"
When I push the OK button, my source isn't available anymore in my "Package
Explorer view". So I have to update the source from the CVS repository.
Do you know what's wrong with my Eclipse (version 3.0.0M6).
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Tnx,
Martijn
