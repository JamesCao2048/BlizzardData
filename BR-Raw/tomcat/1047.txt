Compare with -> Each other is not enabled
Eclipse 3.0 M1 and Eclipse 3.0 I200306100800 Tried Suse 8.2 and Windows XP 1) Select two java files in the Packages View 2) From the context menu sele
ct Compare With.
Note that the option "Each Other" is not enabled.
I use this Compare With Each Other feature all the time to check the consistency between platform implementations and to check the consistency between
 simlar components (such as TextTransfer versus RTFTransfer).
Without it I can not use Eclipse 3.0 
- going back to 2.1.
