Help document shown programmatically does not shows TOC
Scenario: 1) Start Eclipse with some activites disabled (e.g.
PDE) 2) Create an action that shows a topic from PDE doc book using 'showHelpResource' 3) Observe: the document is shown, but the toc is not, and pressing on the button to sync up the toc does nothing This happens in the new Welcome from the Overview page, where there is a link to show overview for 
PDE.
Initially, PDE activity is disabled.
Although Welcome could enable PDE activity before showing the topic, this is not desirable.
