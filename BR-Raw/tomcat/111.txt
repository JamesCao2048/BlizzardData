new workspace chooser dialog can get buried beneath splash
Build I20040316
The new workspace chooser dialog is coming up while the splash screen is still
up, and can get buried beneath the splash screen. If this happens, the user
sits there and waits for Eclipse to start. Pressing the Eclipse icon in the
windows task tray bring the splash screen to the top, confirming that Eclipse
is still starting.
Expectation: the splash screen should be taken down before the workspace
chooser is opened.
