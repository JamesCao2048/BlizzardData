Home/End keys do nothing in UML2SD Object Interaction view
Steps to reproduce: 
------------------- 1.Launch a java process and profile it.
2.Right click on an agent and select "Open with 
-> UML2SD Object Interactions" from the context menu.
3.In the resulting view, click on a call line that does not fit the screen.
4.Hit the Home/End keys.
What should happen is that it should cause the screen to scroll to visualize the end/beginning of the call.
It didn't do that when I tried to do it...
=( This may be a simple matter of user error, but opening this bugzilla just in case it's not...
