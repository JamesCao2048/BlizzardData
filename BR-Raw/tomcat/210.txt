Site editor: Added features should be published by default
When adding features it is not intuitive that a context menu has to be run on
each of the new features to make them visible for users. Who would add a
feature without the intent to publish it??? Default behavior should be to
publish new features. A wizard may make sense to ask if a new category should
be created before publishing the features?
