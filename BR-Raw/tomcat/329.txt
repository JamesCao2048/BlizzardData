No statistics collected when heap option is OPTIONS_NO_INSTANCE_INFORMATION
I am running a profile configuration where heap information is not selected, exec flow and method coverage are selected This map to the following RAC options configuration: TRACE_MODE = noObjectCorrelation ALLOCATION_INFORMATION = none STACK_INFORMATION = boundary TICKET = true BOUNDARY_DEPTH = 4 METHOD_COUNTS = true UNREFERENCED_SYMBOLS = true When I run the app, I get exec flow information at the class object level but the statistics at the package , class, etc are all 0
