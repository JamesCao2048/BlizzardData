[Commands] [Services] HandlerSubmission with IPageSite doesn't work
Build ID: I20040310.GEF's palette page, which due to the lack of a KeyBindingService, creates and registers its own HandlerSubmissions to enable actio
ns.
When a HandlerSubmission is created with a null argument for the IWorkbenchSite (first parameter in the constructor), the actions work on the page.
When getSite() is specified instead, which returns the IPageSite for the page, the actions do not work on the page.
