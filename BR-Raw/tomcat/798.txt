Quick Diff hovers don't use text editor font
Quick Diff difference hovers use the java editor's text font for hovers to provide an easy "visual diff" by hovering/unhovering.
This doesn't work in *text* editors (e.g.
on a *.properties file), since the hover uses a default font and doesn't take over the text editor's.
