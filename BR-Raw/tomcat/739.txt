M5: Running Ant in separate VM gives no console output
On Eclipse 3.0 M5 I have the following problem:
Running an Ant build in a separate JRE (1.3.1_04) results in just one line
appearing in the console:
Buildfile: xxxxxxxbuild.xml
In case of failure even the error dialog (if enabled in Ant preferences) doesn't
show up, so there is no way to tell, that the Ant build has failed.
The only way to tell that the build has finished is when the console window
title changes to "Console - <terminated> ...".
When I run the Ant build in the same JRE (1.4.2_01) as Eclipse I get the full
build output as expected.
In has worked in my last 3.0 version before M5, which was I20030813.
Ant version is 1.5Beta2.
Probably related to resolved  Bug 42222 .
