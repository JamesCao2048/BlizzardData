Classes in certain directories not compiled/found
I am running the latest integration build (dated 08/13/03) - and souce files in
certain directories dont show up when I use Ctrl+Shift+T - they dont even get
compiled.
The source files reside in the following location (from the .classpath file):
<classpathentry excluding="**/org/**" kind="src"
path="Development/plugins/dixons-branch-tools/src/java"/>

These were compiled and I was able to browse to classes in this directory when I
used the 08/06/03 integration build. (Maybe this is not working due to the
hyphen symbol in the directory?
