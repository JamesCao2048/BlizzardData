add an external class path to project
My runtime system requires some configuration files in the class path.
Those paths are not in the project/source-scope/directory.
Neither the configuration files nor the project can be moved.
I would like to add an extternal class path to my project (not to eclipse),
but this is not possible!?
best regards
