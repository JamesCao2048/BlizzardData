Hide local types does not hide local types in field initializers
build I20040303 
- opened org.eclipse.ui.internal.skins.newlook.BasicStackPresentation (new in head) 
- the outline showed lots of local types 
- selected Hide Local Types 
- still had many local types showing 
- took me a while to realize that these were just the ones in field initializers I would expect all local types to be suppressed, whether within a met
hod or field or static initializers.
