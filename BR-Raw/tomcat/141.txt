Symptom DB editor's overall presentation could be improved
Here are 3 fairly simple suggestions for improving the overall presentation of the symptom DB editor: 1.Display a title at the top of the editor.
If you look at other editors of this style (e.g.
plugin.xml, build.properties, extension point schemas), there is always a title, except for the source tab.
2.Do we really need the "Overview" tab?
It doesn't give the user an overview of the symptom database, but shows the file details from the properties.
If you look at the PDE's plugin.xml editor's overview, it gives an overview of what's in the other tabs, in a condensed form.
3.When initially opening the editor, there is nothing selected and the right side of the editor is blank.
Perhaps it would be better to initially select the symptom database (root item), to display the database's values, like name, description, etc.
This way, the right side will never be blank.
