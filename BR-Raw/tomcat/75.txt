Classpath issue
hi, I was using Eclipse (Version: 3.0.0, Build id: 200403100800) till yesterday.
When I downloaded (Version: 3.0.0, Build id: 200403170800).
I am running a Windows XP machine with the JDK 1.5.0 beta.
My project though uses the JDK 1.4.2_03 version to compile and the launch configs also uses the same 1.4.x JDK.
In the project classpath, I have the following jars in the classpath: jce1_2_2.jar, sunjce_provider.jar (in that order) followed by the org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER line.
