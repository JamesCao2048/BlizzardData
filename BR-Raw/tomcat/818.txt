Package view should offer properties for JRE classpath container [build path]
Build 3.0M5 Currently, in order to select a different flavor of a JRE container, one has to select the project, find the build path tab, then library 
tab, then select container and edit it.
It would be far simpler if it offered properties directly on the JRE container element in package view.
