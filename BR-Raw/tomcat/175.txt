Possible mislabelled title in Profiling preferences page
Found in WSWB 3.0 M8 + Hyades 3.0 20040309_1448 driver.
Steps to reproduce:
-------------------
1. Start Eclipse.
2. Profile a java process for a while, then terminate it.
If you look at the Profiling Monitor view, you should see (by default) only
three types of "things": Processes, Logging agents, and Profiling agents.
Now, if you go to the Preferences -> Profiling and Logging -> Appearance, you
will see a section labelled "Show these resources in the Profiling Monitor
view:". If you look in the contents of that section, you'll find that the
Processes, Logging agents, and Profiling agents checkboxes are NOT checked,
while Folders, Monitors, and Hosts ARE checked. If you uncheck everything,
you'll notice that *everything* is shown in the Profiling Monitor view
(contrary to what the label indicates).
I think the section's label should actually say: "Hide these resources in the
Profiling Monitor view:".
