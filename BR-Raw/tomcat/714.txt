This apparently was fixed and now it doesn't work. From cmvc defect 239921:

This is a regression on defect 215557. It appears this regressed and
no one noticed it.  The behavior doesn't work in v5.0 GA either.
See defect 215557 for description of the problem and the solution.
Here's defect 215557:

JVE Palette should persist its open/closed state.
The palette is not persisting its opened/closed state
across sessions of editing. Perhaps it should remember
per input file, its persistance state.

When you open/close the palette is now updates the flag that is
shown on the preferences page that comes from the VCEPlugin.  This then
affects the next opened editors.  I didn't want to make the open/close state on
a per
file basis - it seemed to be more like resizing a viewer to me so it is just
global
for the editor configuration of either split pane or notebook

Persists state across sessions.
