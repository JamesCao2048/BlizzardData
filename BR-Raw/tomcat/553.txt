[workspace] Fails building plugin JARs with multiple source folders
We have several plugin projects where we use source folders to organize our
code.  It is not uncommon to have a plugin with five source folders each of
which is built into a seperate runtime JAR.  This setup compiles fine and runs
just fine but the PDE build is failing.  It fails because our source folders
depend upon each other and PDE requires that a dependent JAR be built first.
The problem is that since they depend on each other, it doesn't matter which
order we put the JARs in the build.properties file, it will always fail.
An example is a plugin with three runtime libraries mapped to three source
folders A, B, and C where A depends on B and C and C depends on A.
