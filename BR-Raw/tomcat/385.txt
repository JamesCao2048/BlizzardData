TrimLayout margins inconsistent with other layouts
Trimlayout has a margin width and height of 0 initially.
This is inconsistant with other layout classes currently existing.
While this is a non-typical layout and likely not going to be used outside the workbench, but it might.
And I think it is better to be consistant in these cases than different.
It will likely just cause frustration for anyone new to this layout.
