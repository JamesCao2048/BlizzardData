CLASSPATH of Project wrong (NoSuchAlgorithmException)
I had a hard time getting an application running under Eclipse that works okay
when running out of Eclipse with a batch file. With the help of somebody in the
JDC Forum (that had a similar problem with Eclipse and solved it) I also was
able to workaround it. Here's the problem:
using JCA by creating a secret key via a Algorithm didn't work
(NoSuchAlgorithmException) when the application runs in Eclipse. The post of
venkateshmj in  http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp ?
forum=9&thread=430078&start=0&range=30#2024814 described the problem and its
solution:
"The basic thing is, eclipse will not find the provider jar file which is in '%
java_home%jrelibext'. So if you are using jboss-ide, open the jboss debug
and configure the classpath. Disable 'use default class path'. Add
sunjce_provider.jar and jce.jar to the 'User classes'. Remove
sunjce_provider.jar from the 'Bootstrap Classes', retain jce.jar in 'BootStrap
Classes'. "
As I don't use JBoss but a simple Java application, i had the same problem and
the same workaround worked for me:
In "Bootstrap classes" of the application un configuration, I removed the
default "JRE_LIB" entry and added (in replacement) rt.jar, jsse.jar, jce.jar to
the "Bootstrap classes". with this change, the NoSuchAlgorithmException
vanished and it worked.
