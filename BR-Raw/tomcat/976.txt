CLASSPATH of Project wrong (NoSuchAlgorithmException)
I had a hard time getting an application running under Eclipse that works okay when running out of Eclipse with a batch file.
With the help of somebody in the JDC Forum (that had a similar problem with Eclipse and solved it) I also was able to workaround it.
Here's the problem: using JCA by creating a secret key via a Algorithm didn't work (NoSuchAlgorithmException) when the application runs in Eclipse.
