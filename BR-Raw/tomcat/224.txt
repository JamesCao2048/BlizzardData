Remove JUnit FastView
I find the fastview shortcut bar to be the biggest waste of space in the
workbench.  At last, this bar disappears when it is not in use, but the
default Java perspective brings it back by placing JUnit as a fast view.
AFAIK, this is the only case of default perspectives defining fast views.
Would you consider removing it or stacking it somewhere. Better yet, open it
as a fast view, but don't open the view until I launch a JUnit test. i.e.,
remove it from the perspective.
thanks.
