OutOfMemoryError while checking out modules
I'm loathe to report OutOfMemoryErrors as bug, as they can easily be fixed by
increasing the heap size.  However, using 2.1.2RC1 for Linux/GTK, I got an
OutOfMemoryError while checking out eclipse modules.  I was checking them out
one by one from the CVS exploring perspective (over ext).

After each check out, the workspace would automatically rebuild (which was quite
time consuming).  After a while, one of the rebuilds failed with an
OutOfMemoryError.

Only 641 errors and even less warnings existed in the workspace.  It seems weird
that an OutOfMemoryError would occur.
