Update floods log with meaningless stack traces
Faling to establish a network connection is *normal* and not an indication of 
a problem. Definitely not worth a stack trace, and probably not worth 
reporting at all unless the attempt to connect was initiated by user command.

I develop on a laoptp, often disconnected from the net for hours at a time, so 
I get a LOT of these.

Successful updates, on the other hand, should be logged.
