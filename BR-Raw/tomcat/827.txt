[OLE] OleAutomation for non-embedded objects
I would like to be able to use OleAutomation and the event handling functions
of Active-X on non-embedded COM Objects too.
Unfortunately the general COM services and the services specific to embedded
components are mixed in OleClientSite and OleControlSite, so this feature might
need some refactoring.
