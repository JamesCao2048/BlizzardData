[View Mgmt] (regression) Navigator no longer shows view input text or tooltip
build I20040317 - in Navigator, select a project or folder and choose Go Into - the input of the view changes to that folder - there is no indication of what the view's input is In M7 and earlier, it would update both the view title to show extra info, and the tooltip.
