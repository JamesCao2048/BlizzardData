Plug-in Project Wizard creation of the Project Name
Setup: Create a plug-in project in the following manner
=====
1) Select File->New->Project... 
2) Select "Plug-in Development" and "Plug-in Project"
3) Specify a "Project name" (i.e. com.example.pluginEx1) + Next
4) (Plug-in Id is auto-filled) Select Next
5) Select "Hello World" as a Plug-in Code Generator + Next
6) You should have Plug-in Name, Version, Provider NAME, and Class Name auto-
filled.

Problem:
========
You decide to return to step #3 to change the original "Project Name" 
from 'com.example.pluginEx1' to 'com.example.pluginEx2'.  Using the '< Back' 
button you would return to the dialog box and manually change it.

I would then return to where I left-off (step #6) by selecting the 'Next >' 
button to arrive at "Simple Plug-in Content".

The autofill information for Plug-in Name, Version, Provider NAME, and Class 
Name have NOT changed.  It still retains the original information before I 
changed the Project Name.

It should auto-fill with the latest information change from Step #3.
