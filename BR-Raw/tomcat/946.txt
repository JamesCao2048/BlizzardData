Logic example has convoluted code in LogicSubPart
First, I hope this is the right place for logic example improvement submissions.
It seems that someone was having fun in LogicSubPart.  its cute, but it could be
confusing to people that do not understand the simplicity of what is happening.
LogicSubPart uses an extremely complicated way of returning a new Vector for
getTargetConnections().  Its adding the elements 1 by 1 to a new Vector then
returning that.  While getSourceConnections simply uses vector.clone(),
obviously much faster, cleaner, simpler, etc..
However the larger issue is that lots of lists are tossed around in the GEF
architecture, but never are they cloned before hand.  Only time they are cloned
is by the receiver of the methods data, when that receiver knows it might modify
the contents.
so perhaps GEF should specify that returned lists are not to be modified, then
nobody has to wonder if they should return clones such as this one example does.
OR they all should return clones.(or unmodifiable collections)
