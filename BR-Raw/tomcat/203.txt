Eclipse throws NullPointerException on JDK 1.4.0
When executed on a 1.4.0 Hotspot JRE, 3.0M7 throws a cryptic
NullPointerException (somewhere in KeyBindings). The platform
never launches. Took a while to realize it was the wrong version
of JRE we're using.
This special case (JRE version) should be caught by the platform, or even
earlier, by the eclipse.exe launcher?
