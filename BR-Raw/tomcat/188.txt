[Coolbar] Binary Compat: IToolBarManager.update method doesn't work
We use code like following: private void createPageToolbar() { IToolBarManager manager = workbook.getActionBars().getToolBarManager(); manager.removeAll(); IAction dowloadArtifactAction = new Action() { public void run() { downloadArtifact(); } }; manager.add(dowloadArtifactAction); manager.update(t
rue); } it works ok for Eclipse 2.x but doesn't for 3.0 (toolbar doesn't reflect changes like add/remove actions).
We have discovered that IActionBars.updateActionBars() resolves this problem and we wondered if it is our bug or Eclipse's bug and is there any workaround.
