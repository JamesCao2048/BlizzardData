[EditorMgmt] Eclipse crashes when maximizing java editor when trying to load file
Eclipse crashes when trying to maximize a Java editor.
At the time, the editor was open on a file that had not yet loaded.
There was significant background load on Eclipse.
I haven't been able to reproduce this with some quick tests, but it's hard to generate the same level of load.
STEPS: 
----- 1.) Open a Java file in a Java editor.
2.) Move that Java file from one project to another 
-- preferrably breaking as many things as possible (e.g., 500+ compile-time errors).
3.) A stub opens in the editor view for the newly-moved file.
4.) Immediately double-click on the title bar for the moved file to cause it to maximize.
OBSERVED RESULTS: 
---------------- The window maximizes, but is empty.
It appears as though the contents are still being loaded by Eclipse.
The virtual machine then crashes with a small dialog box.
Unfortunately, I wasn't running from a terminal, so I have no additional output.
