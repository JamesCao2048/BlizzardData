Need to maintain settings order
Testcase: Marathon Beans - MBTJTextField Weight: 5
There are two problems, currently we can't maintain settings
order. The order stored in the java file is not maintained.
The second problem is that certain properties cannot be set
before other properties. Because of this we must be able to modify
the order of the properties, plus we need a registry of what the
proper order is for a particular class.
For example, JTextField, can't set selectionStart until after Text has been
set. The problem is in this example is that the order of properties returned
is independent of the order set, and due to hashing, the selectionStart may
be applied before text has been set, even though in the code it is the other way
around.
Waiting on EMF to support this concept.
