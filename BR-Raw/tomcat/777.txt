CVS metafiles always have unix EOL
(Third time -- at least I copied the Description pane text this time! Thank you 
bugzilla.)

Ok, second time typing this in because I got an error submitting it the first 
time and Bugzilla told me to hit the Back button and fix it and lost all the 
data on the form when I did (nice). This will be shorter due to my RSI.

Our CVS server is running on an OS X Machine (10.2.6)

When checking out a project from CVS on Windows, it is checked out as a Unix 
project. If you try to perform any CVS actions on the checked out project using 
Tortoise CVS, you are shown an error message that tells you did. I had typed in 
the whole message last time but cannot this time (you cannot copy/paste the 
error message in the dialog -- nice -- they really think of us folk with RSI 
when designing apps). 

Problems due to this: Cannot diff (compare) files in Eclipse. Cannot use 
checked out project with TortoiseCVS.

Seen on WinXP and Windows 2000.
