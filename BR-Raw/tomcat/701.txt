Support of implicit properties
Right now we have to create a content pane for JFrame. This requires us constructing it, when we should use the existing one. This causes problems if people subclass JFrame and put their own. We need to code gen this the call to the owning JavaBean (for implicit properties), e.g. getContentPane(){ if(contentPane == null){ contentPane = getJFrame().getContentPane(); contentPane.setLayout(new GridBagLayout()); } return contentPane(); } Also, for the property sheet if the user expands a property that is not set (i.e. implicit) and sets a sub-property we don't cope with this properly - we null construct the property to be able to apply the subproperty as right now we code generate bad code if there isn't a default constructor available for the intermediate property.
