[CoolBar] [JFace] ApplicationWindow.createCoolBar tests coolBarManager 2x
In ApplicationWindow, the createCoolBar method tests coolBarManager 2x, and doesn't test toolBarManager: if ((getShell() == null) && (coolBarManager == null) && (coolBarManager == null)) { (Line 255) This is the case in 3.0 M6, as well as N20040207. Both win32. The effect of this is that if you call addToolBar(), then addCoolBar(), you get both toolbar and coolbar, though the documentation says you get one or the other. If you call addCoolBar(), then addToolBar(), only the coolbar gets created. Obviously, the code should read: if ((getShell() == null) && (toolBarManager == null) && (coolBarManager == null)) {
