dynamically importet package problems when uninstalling bundle
From Martin Lippert on the newsgroup...
I tried to following: 
- bundle A exports a package via Export-Package.

- bundle B dynamically imports that package via DynamicImport-Package.

- a method of bundle B is called that creates an Object from the mentioned package.
Everything works fine until I uninstall bundle A (via the console).
As a result of uninstalling bundle A (and a refresh) nothing happens to bundle B...
