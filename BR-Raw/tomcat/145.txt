dynamically importet package problems when uninstalling bundle
From Martin Lippert on the newsgroup...
I tried to following: 
- bundle A exports a package via Export-Package.

- bundle B dynamically imports that package via DynamicImport-Package.

- a method of bundle B is called that creates an Object from the mentioned package.
Everything works fine until I uninstall bundle A (via the console).
As a result of uninstalling bundle A (and a refresh) nothing happens to bundle B...
From Jeff McAffer on the newsgroup...
Hmmm, this seems like a bug.
As Pascal mentioned, dynamically importing from A does not affect B's ability to resolve but once B is actually running and loading classes from A, it
 is dependent on A.
Uninstalling A (and refreshing) should cause B to stop and restart.
It can restart even with A gone because it did not explicilty rely on A, it just dynamically imported stuff that happened to come from A.
If I have characterized this correctly, could you enter a bug report against Equinox/OSGi with details?
Simple test case would also be
