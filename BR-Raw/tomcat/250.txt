A missing optional plugin causes low-level Assert exception
I saw this on the I20040226 build.
If an optional plugin (that is, marked as optional=true in 'requires' element,
is in fact not present, a low-level Assert exception occurs during descriptor.
getPluginPrerequisites().
I stumbled across this testing something completely un-related, but since in the
base stack you probably don't have optional plugins which are not present,
thought you might appreciate the report. [BTW, its actually in Hyades plugins
that has an optional plugin which really is not (normally) intended to be
present).
I'm not sure what the right solution is .. either ignore it (and return what is
there) or return a special descriptor that is marked as "missing optional
plugin".
I'll attach test case and instructions, but here's the instructions (not sure
you'll even need the test code is so easy to reproduce).
Description:
TestPlugin has the test code (see testPluginPrereqs())
TestPlugin 'requires' RequiringPlugin
RequiringPlugin *optionally* 'requires OptionalPlugin
Instructions for reproducing
1. Select TesterPlugin
2. Run as ... Junit Plugin Test
All is ok (test passes).
Now, remove (delete or close) OptionalPlugin
re-run steps 1 and 2, and you'll see Assert.isNotNull exception throw deep in
internal.plugins code.
