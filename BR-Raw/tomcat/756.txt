No empty line after opening brace [formatter]
This applies to the new code formatter preference page in I20031203. It seems
to me that the only way to disable empty lines after the opening brace of
classes is to disable _all_ empty lines within classes. This is especially
ugly when wrapping before opening braces. Looking at the following example,
I'd like to get rid of the marked empty lines. I propose an extra option for
this.
public class Example
{
<--- THIS LINE
public static class Pair
{
<--- AND THIS ONE
public String first;
public String second;
};
private LinkedList fList;
