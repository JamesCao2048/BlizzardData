preserve formating of xdoclet tags in java comments
In our project we're making extensive use of xdoclet to generate interfaces and deployment descriptors from our J2EE code.
I'd like to use the Eclipse code formating for Java comments in general to wrap regular comments to the prefered line width but the line wrapping shou

A lot of our code contains comments like the following: /** * @ejb:bean * name="WorkerMDB" * description="Notification worker bean" * transaction-type
="Bean" * acknowledge-mode="Auto-acknowledge" * destination-type="javax.jms.Queue" * subscription-durability="Durable" * * @weblogic:message-driven *

 transaction-type="Bean" acknowledge-mode="Auto-acknowledge" * destination-type=
