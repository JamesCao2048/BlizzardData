preserve formating of xdoclet tags in java comments
In our project we're making extensive use of xdoclet to generate interfaces and deployment descriptors from our J2EE code.
I'd like to use the Eclipse code formating for Java comments in general to wrap regular comments to the prefered line width but the line wrapping should not apply to the xdoclet Javadoc tags.
A lot of our code contains comments like the following: /** * @ejb:bean * name="WorkerMDB" * description="Notification worker bean" * transaction-type="Bean" * acknowledge-mode="Auto-acknowledge" * destination-type="javax.jms.Queue" * subscription-durability="Durable" * * @weblogic:message-driven * connection-factory-jndi-name="notification2/JMSConnectionFactory" * destination-jndi-name="notification2/WorkerQueue" */ With comment formating enabled Eclipse turns this into the following format which is much harder to read: /** * @ejb:bean name="WorkerMDB" description="Notification worker bean" * transaction-type="Bean" acknowledge-mode="Auto-acknowledge" * destination-type="javax.jms.Queue" subscription-durability="Durable" * * @weblogic:message-driven * connection-factory-jndi-name="notification2/JMSConnectionFactory" * destination-jndi-name="notification2/WorkerQueue" */ I've tried creating a customized code formating profile but could find a combination of settings that would suite my needs.
Would it be possible to add another setting to not touch Javadoc tags at all?
