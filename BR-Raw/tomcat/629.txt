Table row doesn't stay colored as selected when editor is displayed on Linux
BUG in Fedora Core 1 Linux with SWT 3.0M6 and below.
If the background color is set then the row will not appear as selected if it is edited (different behaviour from other rows) The problem is that I ne
ed to set the background color because for example before I set the background color to Green and now I want to restore it.
It should appear as selected when edited (that is the behaviour on windows) but it is not.
Here is the snippet adapted from the standard code.
