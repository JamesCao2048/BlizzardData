Eclipse allows setting a source folder's parent as output folder, which wipes out source code
It's possible to select a source folder's parent as the output folder, as described below.
This has the majorly annoying side-effect of wiping out your source code.
Viz: Suppose you have a project named MyProject.

- Create a source folder MyDir/src as a source folder.
This will set the new default output directory to MyProject/bin.

- Create a class, package com.abs.stc, name Hello, in this directory.
Now change the source folder to /MyDir/src and the output folder to /MyDir as follows: 
- Right click on the project and select Properties->Java Build Path->Source.

- click on Allow output folders for source folders.
Click on Output folder, (expand the source folder MyProject/MyDir/src if necessary), press Edit, click on "Specific Output Folder" and change it to My
Dir.
Click OK.

- You'll get a message about not being able to nest MyProject/MyDir/src inside MyProject/MyDir.
Make this message go away by changing the Default output folder at the bottom of the dialog box from MyProject/bi
