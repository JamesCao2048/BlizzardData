Eclipse allows setting a source folder's parent as output folder, which wipes out source code
It's possible to select a source folder's parent as the output folder, as
described below. This has the majorly annoying side-effect of wiping out your
source code. Viz:
Suppose you have a project named MyProject.
- Create a source folder MyDir/src as a source folder. This will set the new
default output directory to MyProject/bin.
- Create a class, package com.abs.stc, name Hello, in this directory.
Now change the source folder to /MyDir/src and the output folder to /MyDir as
follows:
- Right click on the project and select Properties->Java Build Path->Source.
- click on Allow output folders for source folders. Click on Output folder,
(expand the source folder MyProject/MyDir/src if necessary), press Edit, click
on "Specific Output Folder" and change it to MyDir. Click OK.
- You'll get a message about not being able to nest MyProject/MyDir/src inside
MyProject/MyDir. Make this message go away by changing the Default output folder
at the bottom of the dialog box from MyProject/bin to MyProject. (This is
probably where this bug should get fixed; it shouldn't let you do this.)
- Click OK. You'll get a message box asking if it's OK to remove the old
generated sources from the old output folder; click Yes. BOOM! If you're using
Eclipse 3.0 or 2.1.1, this will immediately wipe out your source directory.
(If you're using 2.1, you get a reprieve; your source directory won't get wiped
until try to run Hello.java when you get an error about the main class not being
found.)
