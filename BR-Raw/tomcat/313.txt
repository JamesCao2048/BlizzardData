cannot launch a 2.1 target instance from 3.0
Reported by Daniel Megert in bug 49379 .
Bug 49379 comment 11 : "I have I20040204 and developping for the 3.0 stream works fine.
However, since I have to provide a fix for 2.1.3 I started my 2.1 maintenance workspace up using I20040204.This works as expected.
But when I try to launch a target workspace using PDE's Run-time Workbench launch configuration (I clear the workspace) I get: !SESSION 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Feb 05, 2004 12:52:26.28 !MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform: !STACK java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to acquire application service at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:100) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:324) at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:279) at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:742) at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:581) I deleted all possible .config directories 
- no luck.
Before the OSGI story I was able to run my old workspace and also run targets.
This is now no longer possible." Bug 49379 comment 12 : "Note: I now restarted my 2.1.x workspace using 3.0 M4, added a new Run-time Workbench launch config (as I did before) and it works like a charm hence I assume this to work with latest 3.0 builds as well."
