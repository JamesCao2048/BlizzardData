cannot launch a 2.1 target instance from 3.0
Reported by Daniel Megert in bug 49379 .
Bug 49379 comment 11 : "I have I20040204 and developping for the 3.0 stream works fine.
However, since I have to provide a fix for 2.1.3 I started my 2.1 maintenance workspace up using I20040204.This works as expected.
But when I try to launch a target workspace using PDE's Run-time Workbench launch configuration (I clear the workspace) I get: !SESSION
