Sometimes, freeze SUN station by using scrollbar
On the Java perspective, sometimes, my SUN workstation is freezed by using the text editor vertical scrollbar(after press and drag mouse actions). Result: The workstation screen is freezed, the keyboard and the mouse does not respond. Also it is not possible to kill the eclipse session: to launch a new eclipse session, i have to kill my complete worksession.
