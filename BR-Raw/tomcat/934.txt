Launch warning reappears
Not sure if this debug or PDE

1) Windows>Preferences>Plug-in development>TargetPlatform
2) Select "another compatible..." and specify an appropriate directory
3) Reload
4) Select all
5) Now go to the repositories view and load a project that you have slected in 
the preferences
6) Run
7) You get a warning about a conflict between workspece and external plugins
and that the workspace ones will be used.

This dialog is correct 99% of the time, the problem is it keeps coming back 
unless I take the time to fix the conflict. It should offer to do this for me 
since this is what I am going to do 99% of the time.

Alternatively, when loading a project into the workspace, I should have the 
option of removing it as an external plugin.
