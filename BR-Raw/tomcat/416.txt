Migrate Exec plugins to Eclipse 3.0 in Head stream.
Migrate Exec plugins to Eclipse 3.0 in Head stream.

Manifest (plugin.xml) changes:

* The header of the manifest files for plug-ins (and plug-in fragments) has 
changed to include a new line which identifies the appropriate plug-in manifest 
version.

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<?eclipse version="3.0"?>
	<plugin ...>
	聽聽聽 ...
	</plugin> 

	All our plugins should have this line.


* For 3.0, all plug-ins that reference API classes in the 
org.eclipse.core.runtime or org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-ins 
must explicitly include the following line in the plug-in manifest:

	<import plugin="org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility"/>

	See the migration guide for details.

* The org.eclipse.ui plugin was restructured, and some functionality was moved 
to the following plugins:

	org.eclipse.ui.ide
	org.eclipse.ui.views
	org.eclipse.ui.editor
	org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor
	org.eclipse.jface.text

	You will need to import these dependencies in the plugin manifests, and 
update your classpath.


Source changes


IWorkbenchPage (package org.eclipse.ui)

* public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input)

	This method was removed because it is IDE-specific. Instead, use:
	org.eclipse.ui.ide.IDE.openEditor(IWorkbenchPage, IFile, boolean)

* public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input, String editorID)

	This method was removed for the same reason. Instead, use:
	openEditor(new FileEditorInput(input), editorID)

IEditorRegistry (package org.eclipse.ui)

* public IEditorDescriptor getEditors(IFile input)

	This method disappeared in 3.0, without any documentation explaining 
why.
	Use the String version instead: getEditors(input.getName())
