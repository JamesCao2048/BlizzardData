Palette desc saying 'no items for this editor' doesnt wrap on linux
Palette on the RHS which is configured for jsp files, I open a jsp and the palette has items in it, I open a xml file for which the palette has no items , the description saying 'Palette is not available for this editor' doesnt wrap when the palette view is narrow, so you cannot see the entire description.
It wraps in windows 2000 so you can see the entire description.
Redhat 8.0 Linux, gtk 
<Note by matsu (Matsumoto, Hirotaka), I think this is etools palette or gef palette.
