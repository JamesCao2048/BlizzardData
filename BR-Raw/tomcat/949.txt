Disabling of "definition" not making sense in Search dialog
In the search dialog, in the "limit to" group box, the "definitions" check box is only enabled when the "Function" or the "Method" check boxes in the 
"Search For" are checked.
But if the "Any Element" is checked, the "definitions" group box is disable.
The UI is confusing for the user.
Steps: 1) Go to the C/C++ Search dialog 2) Uncheck everything in the "Search For" group box The "definitions" check box is disabled in the "Limit To" 
group box.
3) Put a check in the "Function" check box.
The "definitions" check box is enabled 4) Put a check in the "Any Element" check box.
The "definitions" check box is enabled since the disabled "Function" check box still has a check in it.
5) Uncheck "Any Element" and then uncheck "Function" definitions become disabled.
6) Check "Any Element".
definitions is still disabled.
The UI is ambiguous to the user.
