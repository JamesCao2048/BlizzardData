[EditorMgmt] List of opened files should close on second click in filename
When using the new tabs I find myself clicking on the filename tab to show
openned files and see that a file I thought was open it isn't... My recorrent
behaviour is clicking on the filename expecting the list disapears, but it is
redrawn.
I think it should have a show/hide behaviour so that the list of openned files
closes on the second click in filename.
