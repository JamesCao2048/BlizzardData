Editor context menus don't apply to mouse location
Context menus in Eclipse editors perform actions on the current cursor/selection, which is unrelated to the location the mouse was when it was right-clicked. This is inconsistent with every GUI I have ever used, as well as the behavior in other views of Eclipse. It is quite jarring.
