[misc] Go To Next Annotation: Message in StatusLine doesn't persist
I20031216-2000

I have 'Mark occurrences in file' switched on and all annotation types enabled
for jumping around with Go To Next/Previous Annotation. In this example: place
the caret on the first 'ans'. Then click 'Go To Next Annotation' repeatedly.
Observe: for most of the annotations, the StatusLine displays the message only
very shortly, and then blanks again.

class A {
	double ans= -1;
	void m1() {
		do {
		ans= 3.1415;
		} while ("e" != "mc^2");
		ans= 12;
		if (ans == ans);
		;
		//TODO it
	}
}
