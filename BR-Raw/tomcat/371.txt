Ant complains about missing jars in classpath
In build M5, there seems to be a problem with running Ant for any target when the containing project points to jar files which are are currently missi
ng AND the project is not associated with CVS.
Normally I use CVS, check out projects containing source code only, use an Ant target to retrieve external resources (jars, zips, tlds, etc.) and then
 add the needed jars to the Java Project's libraries under the "Java Build Path" section of the project's properties.
Once I have the project set up I can build the project, clean the project (run an Ant "clean" target which deletes all generated and retrieved resourc
es), and then build the project again or whatever I want.
However, trying this same senerio with a local (non-CVS) project Ant gives the following type of error (depending on the needed resource): ERROR: Laun
ch: The archive: /someproject/some.jar which is referenced by the classpath, does not exist.
This sort of error is given even if I edit the build.xml file to include only a test target containing an 
<echo>This is a test</echo>.
If the project wasn't the result of a CVS checkout, the Ant invocation doesn't seem to run if the Eclipse project can't find all of its resources.
Since my resources are retrieved by an Ant target which can't be run, I have to delete the missing resources from the project's library list, run Ant 
to retrieve them again, then reassociate them with the project.
Is this fixed with a later build?
