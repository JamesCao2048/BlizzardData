Update wizard only works if eclipse directory in $HOME
I have been having problems with my eclipse install...namely the update wizard not working (could be more, but haven't found them yet).
I've narrowed it down to a $PATH problem I believe.
Namely I can download a binary.zip extract it into my home directory, and run it from within that directory and all is well.
But if I move the same (freshly unzipped) binary into /opt/ it no longer works (I have taken care to delete all 'workspaces' and '.eclipse*' directori
es for each test).I have also ensured that /opt/eclipse is in my $PATH and that the user has rw permisions for the eclipse directory.
I.
Steps to reproduce.
1.Unzip eclipse-binary into home directory.
2.Enter Directory and start eclipse.
3.Go to Help-->Software Updates-->Update Manager-->select an update/package/etc.
4.Click install 5.Go through wizard and related license agreements 6.Accept default install location, click finish....works 7.Repeat 1-5 replacing /* 
with $HOME, no install location available, cannot add install loca
