[Fonts] Java Pref Pages leak 17 fonts
How I did it: With sleak and graphics-trace on: Open Resource perspective; open sleak view; close all perspectives but resource perspective; close all
 views but sleak view.
Close Eclipse.
Open Eclipse again.
Open Window/Preferences.
Close Preferences.
Reopen and close again.
=> loads Dialog fonts and all fonts on the first preference page.
Take a snapshot in sleak view.
We start w/ 52 colors, 2 cursors, 5 fonts, 1 GC, 87 images For each pref page: open preferences select page in tree, close preference dialog, reopen p
reference, close preference, note new resources.
Java: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 6 fonts, 1 GC, 87 images [+1 font] Appearance: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 7 fonts, 1 GC, 87 images [+1 font => "Note" should be
 in the Banner font which has been already loaded through the Workbench pref page] Members Sort Order: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 8 fonts, 1 GC, 96 images 
[+1 font; +9 images (the member/visibility icons) 
-> no leak] Classpath Variables: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 8 fonts, 1 GC, 101
