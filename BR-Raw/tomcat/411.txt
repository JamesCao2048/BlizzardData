[Fonts] Java Pref Pages leak 17 fonts
How I did it: With sleak and graphics-trace on: Open Resource perspective; open sleak view; close all perspectives but resource perspective; close all views but sleak view. Close Eclipse. Open Eclipse again. Open Window/Preferences. Close Preferences. Reopen and close again. => loads Dialog fonts and all fonts on the first preference page. Take a snapshot in sleak view. We start w/ 52 colors, 2 cursors, 5 fonts, 1 GC, 87 images For each pref page: open preferences select page in tree, close preference dialog, reopen preference, close preference, note new resources. Java: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 6 fonts, 1 GC, 87 images [+1 font] Appearance: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 7 fonts, 1 GC, 87 images [+1 font => "Note" should be in the Banner font which has been already loaded through the Workbench pref page] Members Sort Order: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 8 fonts, 1 GC, 96 images [+1 font; +9 images (the member/visibility icons) -> no leak] Classpath Variables: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 8 fonts, 1 GC, 101 images [+5 images -> no leak] New Variable Entry Dialog (reached through Classpath Variables/New...): 52 colors, 2 cursors, 9 fonts, 1 GC, 101 images [+1 font] Code Formatter: 61 colors, 2 cursors, 12 fonts, 1 GC, 101 images [+9 colors (colors used for the embedded editor-> no leak), +3 fonts (one is probably the Java Editor font, the other two are leaks)] Show Profile Dialog (reached through Code Formatter/Show...) 61 colors, 2 cursors, 16 fonts, 1 GC, 102 images [+4 fonts, +1 image (the warning icon -> no leak] Code Generation: 62 colors, 2 cursors, 17 fonts, 1 GC, 103 images [+1 color (will be used by Insert Variable dropdown), +1 font (appearantly the one used by the Insert Variable Dropdown -- shouldn't this be shared/disposed?), +1 image (local type icon -> no leak] Detail formatters: 62 colors, 2 cursors, 18 fonts, 1 GC, 103 images [+1 font (the Java Text Editor font should have already been loaded by the Code Formatter preference page)] Step Filtering: 62 colors, 2 cursors, 18 fonts, 1 GC, 105 images [+2 images -> no leak] Add Step Filter dialog (reached through Step Filtering): 62 colors, 2 cursors, 19 fonts, 1 GC, 105 images [+1 font] Add Packages dialog (reached through Step Filtering): 62 colors, 2 cursors, 23 fonts, 1 GC, 108 images [+3 images -> no leaks; +4 fonts (1 is from the progress dialog)] Work in Progress: 62 colors, 2 cursors, 24 fonts, 1 GC, 108 images [+1 font] Compiler: no leaks Debug: no leaks Installed JREs: no leaks Javadoc: no leaks Editor: no leaks Spelling: no leaks JUnit: no leaks New Project: no leaks Organize Imports: no leaks Refactoring: no leaks Task Tags: no leaks Type Filters: no leaks @@@@ All in all 17 fonts on the following: Java, Appearance, Members Sort Order, New Variable Entry Dialog (reached through Classpath Variables/New...), Code Formatter, Show Profile Dialog (reached through Code Formatter/Show...), Detail formatters, Add Step Filter dialog (reached through Step Filtering), Add Packages dialog (reached through Step Filtering), Work in Progress
