DCR: New SelectionTool with support for panning
Create a new SelectionTool subclass. I want it to behave exactly like the existing selection tool, with the following additions: - When selection tool is in its initial state, if it receives the SPACE keydown, it will switch to a PAN state - While in the PAN (or PAN_IN_PROGRESS) state, a hand cursor will appear - If I mouse down in the pan state, I will transition to a PAN_IN_PROGRESS state which allows scrolling the viewport by pressing and dragging the mouse. - When leaving the state PAN_IN_PROGRESS, return to either the PAN state or the STATE_INITIAL based on whether the SPACE bar is still depressed. Use the obvious name choices for constants, not exactly what I've used. Pratik to review changes before releasing.
