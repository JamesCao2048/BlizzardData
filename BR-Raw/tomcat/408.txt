Outline doens't respect member sort preferences
build 2004-02-10 16:00
1) import junit 3.8.1 into a java project
2) Set eclipse to show members in the package explorer
3) open TestCase.java in the editor
4) Change Prferences / Java / Appearance / Memver Sort Order to show public
members last
5) observe: the setting is observed in the package explorer, but not in the
outline. I don't see why the outline is different.
