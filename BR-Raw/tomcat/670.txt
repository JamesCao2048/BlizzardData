M5 New File from context Menu of a package does not work
This is on 3.0M5. When I want to create a new file directly in a package, the
wizard window won't select the associated directory. In fact, all the fields of
the window are blank.
On previous version, when doing the explained action, the directory of the
selected package would automatically be selected in the "New File" window.
