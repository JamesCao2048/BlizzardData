Unable to launch more than 25 programs
I'm using 3.0m4. I have launched 25 actively running java programs (using the Run menu) but can't launch the 26th. External programs can't be launched either. I thought perhaps I was running out of memory but I don't get any error dialog and the .log file is clean - no messages output anywhere I can tell. All the programs I launched earlier are still running fine, and the console window is popping all over the place with new output from the different processes. One of the 25 is a Workbench, and the other are instances of one smallish Java program I built in the workspace. I still have virtual memory available on the machine (dual Xeon running XP). Is there a limit of 25 launches, or is some undiagnosed error occuring?
