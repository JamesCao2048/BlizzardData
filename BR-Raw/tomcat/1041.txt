Opening a second instance of Eclipse will corrupt .metadata, causing many problems
If you open a second instance of Eclipse, the next time you run Eclipse many
thing will be broken. Removing .metadata will eliminate the problems (although
you, of course, need to reimport your projects then).

Some problems seen:
- Attempting to Search gives the error "No Search Extensions plugged into
workbench or all search pages disabled."
- Attempting to go to the Update Manager results in "Unable to instantiate view:
org.eclipse.update.ui.UpdatesView"
- Attempting to go to a project's property pages gives "No property pages for
<project name>"
- On and on and on...

To Reproduce:
1. Open Eclipse
2. Open a second instance of Eclipse
3. Close the second instance of Eclipse
4. Close the first instance of Eclipse
5. Open Eclipse again and it will be erroneous
