Editor code assist preference box does not allow you to change background for currently selected proposal background
If you look at the preference page for Java->Editor and view the "Code Assist"
tab you will notice that you can change the colors for code assist. There
isn't a selection for changing the background color for the currently
selected "completion proposal background".
My issue is that the background color for the selection looks very similar to
the normal background color for code assist. This makes it very difficult to
determine what code assist option you are selecting.
