[EditorMgmt] Editor drop down cut off at edge of monitor
When the right hand edge of Eclipse is near the edge of the monitor the editor drop down menu gets cut off.
Maximizing Eclipse does not change this.
I am running on a machine with a dual monitor setup.
Note the menu is not spanning monitors as in defect #51240 but actually cut off.
I have "Show multilpe Editor tabs" turned on.
I can also get this to happen with that preference turned off the but I have to size Eclipse down from the left such that the single editor tab does not fit on screen
