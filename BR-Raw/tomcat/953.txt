Group widget doesn't pass focus when pressing mnemonic
Javadoc for org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Group#setText(String) says:
"When the user presses a key sequence that matches the mnemonic, focus is
assgned to the first child of the group.".
Unfortunately, that doesn't work.
Group.checkStyle (int style) begins with
{ style |= SWT.NO_FOCUS; ...,
which prevents
boolean mnemonicHit (char key) {
return setFocus ();
}
from setting focus to the first child of the group.
