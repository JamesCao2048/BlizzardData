Need a separator between 'Include type inheriting ...' and 'stop in main' in the main Java launch configuration tab
Stop in main' seems to be an option related to 'Include external jar ...' and
'Include type inheriting'.
We need a way to separate these options, may be a border around the 'Main Class'
options.
