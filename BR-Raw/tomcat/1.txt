Infocenter opens on busy port
I have apache running on port 80.Starting help infocenter on this port produces no error.
Infocenter is running.
Content cannot be displayed as this port is served by apache.
A consequence is also that infocenter cannot be closed programatically.
Issuing command to shutdown does nothing and reports a time out.
Infocetner can only be killed brutally.
The error about port being taken is produced but it is being logged in the catalina.*.log.
and otherwise ignored.
Infocenter should report it on the command line and exit.
