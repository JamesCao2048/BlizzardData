No context change in editors when right mouse button clicked
When you click the right mouse button within an editor, the context menu for
the current cursor position appears, no matter where the user clicked.
In my opinion, a context change should be performed first when the user
clicks. That is, the context menu should appear for the position the user
right-clicked on.
As far as I know, the current behaviour is not the usual one in an editor. For
example, UltraEdit and MS Word change the context first. At least, it is not
the behaviour I expect.
