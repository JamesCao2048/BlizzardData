[generate delegate] option to use getter [code generation]
Two use cases: 
-if getter exists use it 
-if getter does not exist yet create it @@@@ Would help with "lazy initialization" of the delegate.
@@@@ What would be problematic?
Code like: class A { private String fValue; public String getValue() { return "X"; //does not use fValue } } Now invoke generate delegate methods on "
fValue".
@@@@ Another possibility would be offering create delegate methods including get-methods, i.e.
the tree would also show getXXX methods.
