workspace location is not always fully qualified
Quoting John:
The recently released changes in runtime are causing many resources plugin
tests to fail.  There were two lines in the old code
(InternalPlatform.setupMetaArea) that did this:
//try infer the device if there isn't one (windows)
if (location.getDevice()==null)
location = new Path(location.toFile().getAbsolutePath());
It looks like this code was lost in the refactoring to support platforms
without a data area.  If you don't do this, and you specify a "-data" area
without a device, then there are many places where location comparisons fail to
match because sometimes there is a device and sometimes there isn't. This
sequence needs to be added back, in some central place when the location is
being initialized, to be sure that it always has a device.
