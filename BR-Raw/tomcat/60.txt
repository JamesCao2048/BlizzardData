Runtime Workbench launcher should expose boostrap entries
Up until now, the runtime workbench launcher never had the need to expose the 
bootstrap entries to the user.  This is because the only entry necessary is 
the location of the Main class, and PDE takes charge of looking for this class 
in the workspace/target platform and locating the right one.

When launching a runtime workbench with a profiler such as Yourkit, a JAR 
needs to be added to the bootstrap classpath entries.  Therefore, we need to 
expose a text field in the launcher so that the user can add these entries, 
and we would just append them to the PDE-computed value.
