Javadoc Taglet option missing [javadoc]
Since JDK 1.4, javadoc supports the 
-tag:cm:description argument which provides a nice and simple way of specifying new javadoc tags.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#tag The use of this cmd line argument is not supported in Eclipse (while the use of 
doclets seems to be) and could be easily integrated in the IDE, e.g.
as a project preference.
This request is fueled by a university course where we teach programming using the contract model 
- and while the @require and @ensure tags are still being kept as "future" tags, we would like to have a simple configuration option that allows us to
 generate documentation for the contract model _now_.
