All bookmarks and tasks lost after Eclipse crashes.
////////// My configuration: ///////////////////// 1.Eclipse platform Version: 2.1.0 Build id: 200303272130 2.Besides the standard plugins came with E
clispse platform, I've installed the following plugin: 
- PHPEclipse Tools Core (1.0.9) 
- PHPEclipse SQL Utility (1.0.1) ///////// How did the problem rise: /////////////// 1.I'm doing a PHP project on another machine (mounted the remote 
directory with NFS to my local disk).
2.The remote computer reboot without closing Eclipse properly.
And then Eclipse goes dead ("ps afx" command reveals that the status of Eclipse's main thread is "D" (uninterrupted IO process?
not sure...) ) 3.I "kill" all its child-threads by force, but I was not able to kill its main thread.
4.The remote computer done its reboot, and Eclipse threads got killed automatically.
5.I re-open Eclipse and the project, and I found all my bookmarks and tasks disappeared...
(All other settings, like short-cut keys, are working fine) this is TOO bad because there were more than 50 of them over there...
I'm reading the source code written by another guy, and those bookmarks are really important to me.
Is it possible to restore them?
Can anyone help?
Big thanks in advance!
