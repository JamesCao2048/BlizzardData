Tasks View gets corrupted clicking on column header
I had a Java project with 5-10 classes in it, and about 8-10 //TODO: comments
sprinkled throughout.  When I clicked the Resource column of the Tasks view to
sort by that attribute, all data in the view disappeared.  The Tasks panel
itself, including the control widgets/icons in its title bar are still there.
It just appears as if none of the files in my projects contains any //TODO:
comments, which as I stated, is not the case.
Most disturbingly, exiting and restarting Eclipse does not resolve the
problem.  In fact, I get a message upon startup, apparently as Eclipse is
trying to reload the workspace settings which were saved upon the previous
exit.
Once started up, Eclipse gives me the same error every time I click on any
column header of the Tasks view. The error is:
ERROR: Searching for markers in Tasks view: An internal error occurred
during: "Searching for markers in Tasks view".
