Generated code is wrong when testing UI object existence
Using Eclipse 3 M7 and VE NM720040214
If I create a JFrame using VE, and drop a JPanel into the content pane, the
following code gets generated:
private void initialize()
{
this.setContentPane(getJPanel());  // Generated
...
}
private javax.swing.JPanel getJPanel() {
if (jPanel != null) {
jPanel = new javax.swing.JPanel();
...
This code, when run gives an exception that I am trying to set the contentPane
with null.
I believe that the generated code in getJPanel should be:
if (jPanel == null) {
NOT
if (jPanel != null) {
('==', not '!=')
