GridBagLayout conversion should use "elastic" properties
Currently VE does convert null layout into gridBagLayouts by using
insets and padding to get exactly the same appereance. Quite often
this is not what I'm trying to get, I'd prefer to have a way to
use "elastic" properties of the constraint such as placement and weight
instead, so that when the form resizes the control keep their relative
position (even if this means not getting exactly the same positioning
as in the null layout).
