Nothing happens when launching
I20030113 I first thought there's a severe bug in Debug: after importing the latest build and clicking on the Run (and later Debug) buttons in the toolbar nothing happened, no UI feedback and the Debug view was empty.
I then remembered that I recently chose to always wait until a build is finished (Debug preference).
Going to the Process view I saw tons of Launch jobs waiting.
There needs to be better feedback.
I suggest to show those launches in the Debug view.
