allow ordering in "Run As >" context menu
I find it confusing to the user that the launch shortcuts shown on the "Run >" context menu do not match those that appear in the "Run As" on the toolbar button. One is selection based, where the other is perspective based, which means you get different lists in each perspective. I'd like to see the two lists always match, and preferrably using what is currently in the "Run >" context menu. Since the menu is dynamic, it is "correct" much more often and is based on the selection. The two options can share the selection context, so it should not require additional computation to (e.g.) show the Run As after using the context menu.
