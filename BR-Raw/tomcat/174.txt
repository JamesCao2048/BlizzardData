Missing CVS label decorations in the Package Explorer after a crash.
After Eclipse crashes, I don´t get CVS label decorations on packages in the Packages Explorer.
I´m using hierarchical layout.
When I expand a package with a changed file and click on it and the click again on the package, the label decorations appears.
This happens for files changed between the last start of Eclipse and the crash.
