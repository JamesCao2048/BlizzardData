[formatter][api] ContentFormatter2 should pass indents based on partition
Typical implementations of ContextBasedFormattingStrategy keep a list of partitions to format individually, however each call into the FormattingStrategy sends the same indent information (the region's initial indent) rather than indentation information for each partition, which is not particularly helpful when each partition may be indented differently.
