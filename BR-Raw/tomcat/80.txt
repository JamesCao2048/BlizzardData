CTabFolder does not give available space to tab early enough
build I20040317 + latest from HEAD

- new window with Java perspective open
- show the JUnit view
- only the JUnit tab is visible now; the Package Explorer and Hierarchy tabs are
hidden, and the JUnit tab's text shows: "J..."
- notice there's a fair bit of available space between the chevron and minimize
button
- size the view a little wider
- the Hierarchy tab appears, but JUnit's is still truncated
- keep resizing a little wider in small increments
- it takes a while before JUnit is no longer truncated
- by the time it does, there is lots of space between the chevron and minimize
button
- it could have stopped truncating long before
