Browser.setText fires an navigation event
if you call Browser.setText() an URL navigation event is fired with an about:blank url.
Is there any chance this can be changed?
It is too anoying.
We have a case where we want to intercept about:blank URLs, but can differentaiate between an about:blank navigation event generated due to a setText 
call, or one generated due to a real link that refers to about:blank.
Mazen.
