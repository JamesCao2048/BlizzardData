Find/Replace copy/paste doesn't work.
If i select some text in the editor and Copy it to the clibboard and then i open the Find/Replace dialog if i then try to paste te text in the find/replace dialog in te find or replace with fields.
The text isn't paste in the thos fields but in the textarea below it! copy text (CTRL-C) in the find/replace dialog doesn't seem to work either.
