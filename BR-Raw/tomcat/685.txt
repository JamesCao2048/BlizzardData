Progress support summary
Existing progress framework components:
- New api for showing progress IProgressService::showBusyCursorWhile(). 
- Progress view
  i.   can't determine ordering of errors, no chronology
  ii.  should only show user tasks (decorators, updating sync view shouldn't
       be shown by default (related to next point).
  iii. no way of linking progress among several related jobs
  iv.  opening an error requires clicking details, it should automatically
       expand.
  v.
- Blocked progress dialog appears for free if main thread is 
  about to block and there is no progress monitor passed to core.
  i. this has a problem in that if the progress monitor passed in to a runnable
     is not null but instead a dummy progress object, this auto-support doesn't
     work.
- Background jobs running at shutdown
  i. should maybe prompt user with more informative message an options to kill 
     them or continue waiting.
- Error occuring in background jobs
- View part progress? What is this going to look like?
