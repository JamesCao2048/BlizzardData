[KeyBindings] Ctrl-A doesn't work in text fields but other accelerators do
I20040317 In the context menu for text fields I see Undo, Cut, and so on.
The following accelerators work for these actions: Ctrl-Z 
- Undo Ctrl-X and Shift-Del 
- Cut Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Ins 
- Copy Ctrl-V and Shift-Ins 
- Paste Del 
- Delete but this doesn't: Ctrl-A 
- Select All 
<-- doesn't work For example, select Window > Preferences > Workbench.
Click in the Workspace save interval field and press Ctrl-A for Select All.
It just beeps.
Now try any Windows app, for example, IE on this bugzilla form.
Right click on a text field gives the same context menu, but Ctrl-A works by selecting all the text in the field.
Other keys like Home, Shift-End, and so forth work fine in Eclipse text fields, like a native app.
Ctrl-A is the only one that has the problem as far as I've noticed.
