AJDT does not install properly in Eclipse 3.0 M6
I just installed a clean version of M6.
I followed the install instructions using live install.
All of the components (as indicated in the manual install)
were present and in their appropriate locations.
When I run eclipse, non of the aspectJ features are available.
When I go to the plugin status, I recieve the following:
No plug-in: "org.eclipse.aspectj" included at runtime.
No plug-in: "org.aspectj.ajde" included at runtime.
No plug-in: "org.eclipse.ajdt.ui" included at runtime.
I even installed everything manually again to ensure everything
was in its place.  Still no AJDT features can be accessed.
