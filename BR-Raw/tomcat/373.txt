[ActivityMgmt] Show all option should move to a radio button
The Show all option should be a radio button at the bottom of the relevant
dialogs.
Selecting it will replace the contents of the tree with the new entries. We
should attempt to keep selection and expansion state as much as possible.
This button will not be shown if
1) There are no activities
2) The application has the "do not show all" option set.
