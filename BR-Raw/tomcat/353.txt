Opening a large project causes flashing and mouse problems.
I opened a large Java project (~4000 source files) from the Resource Perspective by right-click/Open Project.
It takes a while, fine, but the cursor and all of the Perspective icons in the left bar flash like *mad* b/w the hourglass cursor and normal pointer.
The Progress view reveals that eclipse it calculating state for every file.
CPU usage is 100% by the Windows Task Manager.
This causes an odd problem on Windows XP: While E is opening the project, when I mouse over to the task bar to click on a different app (Mozilla 1.6, which happens to have multiple windows open, so you get a popup of window titles in the task bar), the pop flashes to and it is very hard to get it to
 stay open to switch to one of the opened windows.
I wonder if the changing of state of the cursor causes some side effects with the OS?
