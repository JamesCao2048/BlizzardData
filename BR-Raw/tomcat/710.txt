The proper terminate sequence is not follow when target terminate fails
If, for example, the target can not be terminated it becomes impossible to terminate the session.
Since the button becomes disable.

- It would be nice to catch the exception and continue the termination sequence on the session.

- Even if the termination fails on the target, the button should not be disable when the exception is thrown since later on it could be done successfu
