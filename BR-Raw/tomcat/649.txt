JUnit view slows down the execution of unit tests. [JUnit]
It seems that for a huge number of tests (I'm using a lot of test suites
generated from external test data) Eclipse's JUnit view slows down the execution
of the whole suite. I believe that because of showing an execution status for
these test in the test hierarchy, as well as status in the status line. I
believe that view can be implemented in a better way, to do not slow down the
execution of unit tests.
