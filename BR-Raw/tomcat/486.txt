Can't load ServiceTracker class
Build: I-20040128 I would like to use the core PluginConverter service in the PDE plugin-to- bundle conversion wizard.
In my code, I have ServiceTracker tracker = new ServiceTracker(PDEPlugin.getDefault ().getBundleContext(), PluginConverter.class.getName(), null); Everything compiles in the workspace.
But when I run a runtime workbench, and this line gets executed, the ServiceTracker class can't be loaded.
