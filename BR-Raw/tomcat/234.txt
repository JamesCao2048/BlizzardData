The Ctrl + Space
I try to create a class that will implements an ActionListener.
After I have created it, I type public void action(follow by Ctrl+Space) and the next thing I know is, I been given this message.
"void is an invalid type for the variable act".
private class CancelAction implements ActionListener { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae){ } } As you can see here, I try to create the actionPerformed using the friendly Ctrl+Space but, eventually it end up...I need to type myself.
