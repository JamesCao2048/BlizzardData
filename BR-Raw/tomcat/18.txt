ctrl-o doesn't filter correctly
build i0323:2000, winxp, j9sc20031212

When I am using ctrl-o to open the outline pop-up, I am getting weird filtering
behaviour when I am typing in partial method names.

I have field, imports, and packages filtered out via the ctrl-o filter options.
I have the list sorted.

Will attach screen shot.
