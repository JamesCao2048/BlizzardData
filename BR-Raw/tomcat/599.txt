Double-click and quick fix annotations
Build: I20040106 I was annoyed by the fact that warning annotations hid my breakpoints, and by the fact that double-clicking in the vertical rule to a
dd/remove a breakpoint also caused the quick-fix shell to pop up.
So, I removed the warning annotation from the vertical ruler from the java editor preference page.
However, even after removing the annotation from the ruler, double-clicking on a line that contains a warning still causes the quick fix shell to open
.
It seems that the action associated with that annotation should not happen when the annotation is turned off.
