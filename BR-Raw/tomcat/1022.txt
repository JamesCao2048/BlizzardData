Installing patch via New Updates search doesn't respect missing optionals
Problem: Errors are reported when trying to apply a fix in a valid situation. Installing from a bookmark works, but installing via New Updates search does not. Scenario: FtrA includes optional FtrB. If FtrA gets a fix applied then installing that fix may fail if optional FtrB is not installed. Steps to reproduce: Install only FtrA and not the optional FtrB. Use Help > SoftwareUpdates > NewUpdates to search for fixes. It reports that a patch for FtrA is available. Attempt to install it. You get an error message saying that the ftrB plugin is not found. What's going on: During an install from a bookmarked site the user is shown the "optional features" panel. Since FtrB isn't installed, that choice is not selected by default. However, when installing via "New Updates", this panel is bypassed, and it seems that the default selections in that case includes FtrB. I have a working demo of this available if needed.
