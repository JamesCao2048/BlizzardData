deadlock expanding tree
M4 candidate being tested

Here are the steps, not sure how reproducable the problem is:
- start brand new eclipse
- Window -> Show View -> Other, select CVS - CVS repositories view, OK
- it will be opened on top of Navigator view
- right-click -> New > Repository Location...
- create extssh connection to dev.eclipse.org
- expand HEAD, select 4 projects: org.eclipse.swt, org.eclipse.swt.examples, 
org.eclipse.swt.motif, org.eclipse.swt.tests
- right-click -> Check Out
- it starts retrieving the projects
- click on Navigator view tab after a few seconds, it switches there fine
- the org.eclipse.swt project is shown in the Navigator since it's currently 
partially retrieved
- click on its + to expand its tree, and the cigarette stops smoking 
immediately and the desktop freezes
- will attach the dump that kill -3 gave next
