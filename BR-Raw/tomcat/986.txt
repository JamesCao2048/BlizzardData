[Editor Mgmt] Need extension to intercept editor opening
An extension that allowed a plugin to intercept an IEditorInput before the 
editor opens would be nice.

something like:

public IEditorInput checkInput(IEditorInput)

The use I see would be valuable in the case of a MultiEditor. A plugin could 
intercept an input, and potenially return a MultiEditorInput to take its place.

So the interception would need to occur before the  editor is created.
