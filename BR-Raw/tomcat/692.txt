Classpath should be expanded on entry into tab
The (Ant) classpath tab top level entries should be expanded when I enter the 
tab (else the user just has to expand to see what's there). Exiting/entering 
the tab should not change what the user has displayed (currently, the tab 
collapses the top level entries).
