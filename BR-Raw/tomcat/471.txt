Preference Dialog goes blank after removing plugin
This was in Milestone 6.I installed the eclipse-cs plugin ( http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/ ) and it didn't appear to work.
The preference dialog was working fine at this time.
Then I removed it and added the Checkclipse plugin ( http://www.mvmsoft.de/content/plugins/checkclipse/checkclipse.htm ), and that didn't work at all.
The preference dialog wouldn't even come up.
So I removed it.
Preference Dialog would come up, but was empty.
I reinstalled eclipse-cs, and I got the same thing.
I installed both of them, and the Preference Dialog returns, but it refuses to bring up preferences for those plugins.
Here is the stack trace puke that happens when the preference dialog is blank
