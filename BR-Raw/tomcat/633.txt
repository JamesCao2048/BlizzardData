New Code Formatter pref page: White Space: Mixed capitalization [code formatter]
I20031216 Edit a profile using the new code formatter pref page, go to "White Space" tab: some terms are fully capitalized (e.g. Member Functions) while others only start with a big letter (e.g. Control statements). The page should use everywhere the same pattern.
