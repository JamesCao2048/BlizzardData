ExtensionPointSchemaBuilder process unneccesary schemas
I have a project, with a "test" folder, that contains several schemas, dtds, etc., used for testing.
When I do a "rebuild all", I get the the following build error.
The error itself seems to be another bug on schema processing (which I'll open after this one), but this bug I'm reporting is that is seems that the s
chema builder should not be processing all schema files in a project.
I'm not sure how its decided which might go with extension points, but in large projects with lots of schemas, would result in lots of unnecessary pro
cessing.
Plus, there could be truely invalid schemas (perhaps under development), which should not interfere with build.
I've seen this on M4 and M5 builds.
