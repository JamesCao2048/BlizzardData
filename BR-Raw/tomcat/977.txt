setting keyword substitution mode doesn't work if CVS modul was checked out into a sub-folder of a project
Hi, i've got a project and checked out 2 CVS moduls into subfolders of this project.
So the project-folder itself isn't shared although Eclipse seems to use some dummy configuration.
By the way: that is awful.
That seems like a workaround to me and should be changed.
Here are the error message i got: Problems encountered setting keyword substitution Expected RCS file /cvsroot/mvnforum/myvietnam/src/net/myvietnam/mvncore/exception/ExportException.java to be a child of remote root for this command /cvsroot/mvnforum/CVSROOT/Emptydir Expected RCS file /cvsroot/mvnforum/myvietnam/src/net/myvietnam/mvncore/exception/ImportException.java to be a child of remote root for this command /cvsroot/mvnforum/CVSROOT/Emptydir
