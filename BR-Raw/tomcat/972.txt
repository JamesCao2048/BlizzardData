[RFP44] 4.2.5 Filter packages form base classloader
Otherwise known as "handling the endorsed libs" Currently class load requests are first delegated to the parent class loader of the bundle (typically 
the Application ClassLoader or Bootstrap ClassLoader; we will call it the base classloader here).
This is standard classloader practice.
However, sometimes it may be desireable to “hide” packages provided by the base classloader so that a bundle may instead provide them.
For example, you are running the OSGi environment on J2SE.
The J2SE installation provides a version of Xerces and the org.w3c.dom and org.xml.sax packages.
However, these packages are an older version that the one needed by bundles running in the framework, e.g.
the latest version of Xerces.
So we want to install a bundle which exports a newer version of these packages.
The framework must be configured to “hide” the old version of these packages from all bundles, so that the new versions of the packages can be instead
 used.
