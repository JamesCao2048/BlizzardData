Plugin import - wizard does not consider target platform refresh
Build 20031202 I am developping for Eclipse 2.1 using a self-hosting 2.1 workspace on top of Eclipse SDK 3.0.I wanted to launch Eclipse 2.1 as a runtime workbench so as to run some test suites (due to bug 48125 ); and thus remembered I needed to import an extra plug-in: org.eclipse.pde.junit.
In order to do so, I did the following: 
- open the file import plug-in wizard 
- configured the target platform there to point at a 2.1.2 SDK install 
- select import as binary 
- press NEXT 
- in the list
