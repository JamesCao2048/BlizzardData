[JUnit] JUnit - Run Test for Class
If I just want to test a single unit of the application, I do not want to look for the corresponding test case.
I thought that selecting the class in the package explorer should bring up the option "Run JUnit Test for Class".
The corresponding test is then looked up and run automatically.
The same could be implemented for a set of classes or a package.
