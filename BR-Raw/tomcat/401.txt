[formatting] formatter removes last line with block comments
The formatter seems to remove anything contained on the line with the end block
comment.
before formating:
example:
/*
style.process(
xmlinput,
new XSLTResultTarget(response.getWriter()));	*/
After formating:
/*
* style.process( xmlinput,
*/
If I put the end block comment on the next line if format properly.
I am using all the default settings for 3.0M6
