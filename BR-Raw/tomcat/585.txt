setRawClasspath(...) should fire a F_CLASSPATH_CHANGED delta
Build 20041013 As described in bug 38513 , calling IJavaProject.setRawClasspath(...) currently fires no delta when the resolved classpath is the same.
It should always fire a F_CLASSPATH_CHANGED delta if the raw classpath has changed.
This new flag would be attached to an IJavaProject delta.
