Ant classpath problems
I20031202 I'm no longer able to run my Ant scripts in I20031202. I'm getting the error dialog of attachment #1 [details] . For Ant's classpath pref page see attachment #2 [details] . Ant's home seems to be updated, but the Ant Home Entries refer to a stale folder. Is this my fault or should Ant work automatically from build to build?
