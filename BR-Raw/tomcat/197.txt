[Scalability] Search fails to give all declarations of a medium large project
Build 040304 RAM 512 (could only use 330) In Search, part of the scalability requirement, as a P1, is to search for all declarations named * of any type.

I took a project that had a total 738 .c, .cpp, .hpp and .h files.
