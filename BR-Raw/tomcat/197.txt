[Scalability] Search fails to give all declarations of a medium large project
Build 040304 RAM 512 (could only use 330) In Search, part of the scalability requirement, as a P1, is to search for all declarations named * of any type.
The workspace would have a large number of tokens in the scope.
I took a project that had a total 738 .c, .cpp, .hpp and .h files.
Please see me for the project.
Steps: 1) Load the project in Eclipse/CDT 2) Bring up the Search C/C++ Dialog 3) Credentials: Search For: Any element Limit To: Declarations Scope: Workspace 4) Click on Search It could never finish it.
It seemed that after 30 minutes, Eclipse did not have enough memory to perform the operation.
It started at a reasonable pace believing it will finish in 7 minutes or so.
But the search slowed down exponentially.
It was at about 85% that CDT looked stuck.
By cancelling the Search, Eclipse/CDT took 10 to do it.
I am just reporting the fact that CDT can not handle such a search even though an experience developer will not do this as he will do a more specific search.
Should we discourage the use of * with a message or other UI indicators?
