Opening a very large sequence diagram hangs the UI
The vast majority of the time is spent loading the model, not drawing the
diagram. There is a progress monitor dialog, but it is frozen and the user
cannot cancel, even though the cancel button is enabled. All the work is still
being done in the UI thread.
The solution involves forking a new thread to perform all the work except UI
work. As far as displaying progress, displaying a dialog may be too intrusive.
I will consider alternatives.
