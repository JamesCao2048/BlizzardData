CVS Annotation could use diff-colours and tooltips
I think the current CVS annotation functionality is a bit cumbersome since it is from the list of lines to the code, and not from the code to the auth
or.
I therefore suggest that the current approach for quick diffs (namely to use different colours in the left sidebar) could be extended to show a colour
 for each "cvs annotation block" (two which alternates would be fine), with a tool tip saying the name of the changer, and 
- if clicked 
- synchronized with the current list of changes in the CVS Annotation view.
