outline and ant runner views should include imported targets
In handling an imported file (using the <import> task), the outline and ant runner views should behave similarly as when entity includeds are used. The difficulty in implementing this, I am guessing, is that imports are probably resolved at runtime rather than at parse time. A build file author might, perhaps, use a property dereference to in the <import file=""/> declaration. To accomediate this an action in the views could prompt the user with a dialog allowing him to associate the import with a specific file in the file system. This configuration detail could be saved in a comment in the build file itself or else in some other configuration store. Of course, we could handle direct file references now and code for property dereferences in the import's file attribute later.
