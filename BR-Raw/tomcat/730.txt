Property sheet does not repaint
Build I20031210 1) Select something in the Navigator to make the vertical scroll bar appear in the property sheet 2) Scroll the property sheet vertically using 'v' button Observe: the horizontal grid lines are not cleaned up, so they start to appear inside the rows.
Looks like some refreshes are not happening.
