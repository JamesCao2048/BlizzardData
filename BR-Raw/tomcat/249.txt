[MPE] [EditorMgmt] MultiPageEditorPart should be supported better by editor manager
Eclipse Forms add support for multi-page editors where some pages are forms, but one or more pages are source editors.
Here is the scenario that will represent a significant problem for PDE: Imagine a multi-page editor based on MultiPageEditorPart that has more than one source editor as tabs.
Each source editor opens a different file in the project.
Example: new PDE manifest editor will open plugin.xml, META- INF/MANIFEST.MF and build.properties in their corresponding tabs all the time.
The same editor is registered for all three files 
- the only difference is that different pages are initially selected for each file.
Imagine that you opened plugin.xml.
Since there are source editors in MultiPageEditorPart, some have editor input for files opened by the editor itself (not by the user).
Now imagine that while the editor is still open, you select 'build.properties' and open it as well.
Today: a new instance of the multi-page editor is opened Desired behaviour: editor manager should detect that an instance of MultiPageEditorPart is opened and that one of its nested editors has the matching input.
The editor should simply be brought to front (ideally, a suitable page should also be shown but we can think about it later).
The UI team has all that is needed to achieve this behaviour 
- MultiPageEditorPart belongs to the UI team and it can do something like this: if (editorPart instanceof MultiPageEditorPart) { MultiPageEditorPart multiEditor = (MultiPageEditorPart)editorPart; for (int i=0; i<multiEditor.getEditorCount(); i++) { IEditorPart nestedEditor = multiEditor.getEditor(i); if (nestedEditor!=null) { IEditorInput nestedInput=nestedEditor.getEditorInput(); // if the nested input matches the desired file to open, // just activate the multi editor intead of creating a new instance.
} } } I am marking this as major because it will be a serious usability issue for the incoming multi-source PDE editors.
