[Formatter] white space -> Array allocation expression not working
build i0128, winxp, j9sc20031212 I have White Space 
-> Arrays 
-> Array element access 
-> after opening bracket not checked in my formatter preferences and it still is adding a space.
Although the preview in the preference page looks ok.
e.g.
foobar[ result.size()]; ^ Notes: 
- toggling the preference has no effect 
- this only happens in one of my workspaces 
- formatter settings are modified from Basic 
- in the workspace that it does work ok, I think that its modified from Java defaults
