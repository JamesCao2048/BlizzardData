Outline flickers when opening/editing files
When I'm editing a larger files with a lot of items to display in the outline window (a header file for instance with lot of defines), the outline win
dows begins to flicker and begins to consume all processor time.
The effect is so strong that the UI is nearly unusable.
The only way is have the outline window closed.
I'm using eclipse 2.1.2 and CDT 1.2 GA.
Thanks
