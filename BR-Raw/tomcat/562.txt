[Commands] Error in command schema context definition
The explanation of the "context" definition within the org.eclipse.ui.commands extension point schema includes both a "parent" and "parentId" attribute.
Since the descriptions are identical, it looks like one of them is outdated?
# parent 
- The unique id of the parent context.
If this context has a parent, it will borrow all key bindings from its parent, in addition to the key bindings defined in its own context.
# parentId 
- The unique id of the parent context.
If this context has a parent, it will borrow all key bindings from its parent, in addition to the key bindings defined in its own context.
