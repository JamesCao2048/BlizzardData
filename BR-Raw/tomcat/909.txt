Code Complete finds local variables
Searches for the declarations of local variables return the function name they
are defined in as the search result.
Code Complete should not include local variables for 2 reasons: 1) search will
find locals not visible at the point the user hits ctrl-space and 2) the
function name will appear in the code complete list and it will not usually
start with the same prefix.
Search needs to provide support for excluding local variables from the search
and Code complete needs to use that support.
