Hierarchy view should show package names of types
build I20030917 
- open hierarchy view on org.eclipse.ui.internal.registry.RegistryReader 
- it has several subclasses called PluginRegistryReader 
- there's no way to determine which package and source folder these come from without opening them I would expect this info to appear in the status li
ne, or a tooltip.
It's possible that info in the status line is getting wiped out by the background progress monitor.
