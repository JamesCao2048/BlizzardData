[DND] Workbench "locks up" after call to openEditor
Build 20040226 I've got a test case that is consistently locking up the workbench.
The UI doesn't totally freeze, it just stops responding to most input.
I can still give focus to some of my visible views and perform some actions, but most things (like trying to activate a non-visible view) don't work.
It happens right after I select a stack frame in the Debug view (the LaunchView in the stack trace): !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Feb 26, 2004 
12:58:29.418 !MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: "org.eclipse.core.runtime".
