[KeyBindings] User needs access to multiple configurations
The workbench should support multiple, orthogonal keybinding configurations.
For example, for a WYSIWYG HTML editor (or any other non-source editor), "emacs" configuration makes no sense.
They would instead want to define configurations for other HTML keybindings, such as "FrontPage", "DreamWeaver", etc.
The user should be able to activate simultaneously the "emacs" mode for the Java editor, and the "frontpage" mode for the html editor.
