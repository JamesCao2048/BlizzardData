[ViewMgmt] can not programmatically move a view in a perspective
on Eclipse RCP, you must create a perspective with views and positions of
theses views. But there is no API to move programmatically a view in the
perspective at another place.
in the perspective , we have :
IFolderLayout bottomRight = layout.createFolder("brID",IPageLayout.LEFT, 0.5f,
layout.getEditorArea());
bottomRight.addView("RCPview4.OC1View");
