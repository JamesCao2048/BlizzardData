Plugin project directory no longer on classpath
In eclipse 3.0 build 200401210900, the project root directory is not on the
plugin's classpath when I run a runtime-workspace.
I don't know if this is an intentional side effect of the osgi stuff, but it
causes me some problems - e.g. I have to copy my log4j.properties file to the
"bin" directory for it to be found.
