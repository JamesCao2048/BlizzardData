[formatting] provide a basic text/sgml formatter
Have a basic text formatter that converts leading n-spaces to tabs, and maybe leading tabs to n-space.
Current plugins like eclipsetidy may be ok for SGML like, but there is no plain text n-space-to-tab formatters.
If it can do a quick parse of SGML like files and arrange the indentation too, that would be great.
Not a full XML editor.
Just the formatter.
Thanks.
