new sync view resources layout switch
Now there's the possibility to have three different looks in the new sync view,
tree, compressed tree, table.
There's the need that the "Toggle layout..." switch becomes a drop down menu
that allows to choose between the three looks in a single step, instead of
having to go into view preferences to change between tree/compressed tree mode.
Or perhaps you could also add the three looks switch to the view context menu.
