[PropertiesView] Property Sheet "Misc" category not always expanded correctly
When the property sheet view is set to show categories the "Misc" category is not always expanded correctly. 1. Select an object that only has properties in the "Misc." category (so that the viewer will not show the "Misc" category explicitly). 2. Change selection to an object with properties in the "Misc" category and some other category (so that the viewer will show "Misc" and other categories explicitly). Note that the "Misc" category is not expanded. NOTE: You may have to do these steps twice to reproduce the problem. The problem does not appear to occur on the first selection change.
