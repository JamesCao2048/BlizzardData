[EditorMgmt] Typo in IPageLayout.ID_EDITOR_AREA = "org.eclipse.ui.editorss"
Someone asked me if they could add a few to a perspective relative to the editor area instead of another view.
I believe the answer should be yes, they just have to refer to the area by name in their plugin.xml.
However, looking at the source code, the editor area name is defined by the constant IPageLayout.ID_EDITOR_AREA which has the value "org.eclipse.ui.editorss".
This looks like a typo so it probably shouldn't be documented this way and it should be changed.
Changing it would probably break
