Add "Organize Package" or "Refactor/Copy..."
Sometimes I need to duplicate code from one package a new version.
So what I really want is to be able to select all or some of the classes in a package, right-click on the selection and choose "Refactor/Copy...", ins
tead of "Refactor/Move...".
"Refactor/Copy..." would be the same as "Refactor/Move..." but without deleting the source files.
Today, I create the new package dir and copy the .java files from one dir to the other in the Resource perspective.
I must then change each "package" statement, granted I can do this with a Search and Replace, but at this point it would be nice to right click on the
 selected files or package node and say "Organize Package" such that Eclipse would then fix the package statements.
Thanks, Keep up the superbe work (I'm 
-1 non-platform UIs).
