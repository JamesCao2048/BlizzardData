Add "Organize Package" or "Refactor/Copy..."
Sometimes I need to duplicate code from one package a new version.
So what I really want is to be able to select all or some of the classes in a package, right-click on the selection and choose "Refactor/Copy...", instead of "Refactor/Move...".
"Refactor/Copy..." would be the same as "Refactor/Move..." but without deleting the source files.
Today, I create the new package dir and copy the .java files from one dir to the other in the Resource perspective.
I must then change each "package" stateme
