Allow Bitwise-Or for listener type on widgets
Allow the addListener method on widgets to accept a bitwise or to allow a single handler to be easily specified. For example: If I have a handler class that implements several listeners Then I could add this in a single call like: widget.addListener( SWT.KeyPressed | SWT.MouseUp | SWT.MouseMove, listener ); instead of: widget.addKeyListener( listener ); widget.addMouseListener( listener ); etc.
