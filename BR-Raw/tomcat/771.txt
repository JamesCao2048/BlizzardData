Synchronizing RTF files always reports same
I have some MS Word RTF documents in my project. I have added the documents 
successfully to the projects CVS module. However, now that I have changed the 
documents with Word (started from Eclipse), Synchronize believes no commit is 
necessary. It consistently reports no changes and I am not able to commit the 
changed version to the repository. Even when I just "commit" without 
synchrinizing first, nothing happens.

Things I checked:

- The Eclipse properties for the local file shows the correct, new date.
- In CVS there is only the initial version, with correct (old) date.
- The local document is really different from what's in the repository.
- The document is checked in as binary.
