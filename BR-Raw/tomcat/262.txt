Format command moves //$NON-NLS comments to next line.
When using the Source 
-> Format command, it moves the //$NON-NLS comments to the next line invalidating them.
To reproduce this bug, go to Windows 
-> Preferences 
-> Java 
-> Code Formatter 
-> Edit 
-> Arguments 
-> and set line wrapping to "Wrap always except first element if necessary".
Then format some source like the following: SomeObject someObject = new SomeObject("Parameter1", //$NON-NLS-1$ "Parameter2", //$NON-NLS-1$ null); This
 will end up like: SomeObject someObject = new SomeObject("Parameter1", //$NON-NLS-1$ "Parameter2", //$NON-NLS-1$ null); Which defeats the whole purpo
se of using the non-internationalizable comments.
