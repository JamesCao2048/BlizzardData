Log goes in config area then gets blown away by PDE
build I20040324-0800 Scenario: I want to run my RCP app as a runtime-workbench, where my workspace and/or install contain other plugins that I don't w
ant picked up for free.
Example: the RCP browser example 
- load org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser 
- create a runtime workbench launch config for it 
- on the plugins page, carefully choose the plugins required: 
- org.eclipse.core.runtime 
- org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility 
- org.eclipse.osgi.* 
- org.eclipse.swt and its platform fragment 
- org.eclipse.jface 
- org.eclipse.ui 
- org.eclipse.ui.workbench 
- org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser 
- accidentally omit one of the above (in my case, it was the browser plugin (OK, so I'm sleep-deprived)) 
- run 
- the process comes up then terminates with no help 
- no workspace directory exists yet 
- PDE has blown away the config area, so there's no log to consult This makes it really hard to debug this stuff, which is tricky enough to begin with
.
And I have a clue where to look.
