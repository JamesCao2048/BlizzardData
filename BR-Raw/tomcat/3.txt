Log goes in config area then gets blown away by PDE
build I20040324-0800 Scenario: I want to run my RCP app as a runtime-workbench, where my workspace and/or install contain other plugins that I don't want picked up for free.
Example: the RCP browser example 
- load org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser 
- create a runtime workbench launch config for it 
- on the plugins page, carefully choose the plugins required: 
- org.eclipse.core.runtime 
- org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility 
- org.eclipse.osgi.* 
- org.eclipse.swt and its platform fragmen
