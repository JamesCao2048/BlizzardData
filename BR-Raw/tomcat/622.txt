dump only changed classes
As suggested by William Louth on aspectj-users, could the compiler support a flag to only dump unchanged classes?
That would permit a simple copy rule for updating jars and provide the SCM world with concrete de-minimus proof and protection against aspects gone wild.
It might soothe some of the pain if we don't fully support 
-outjar.
For those interested in contributing a patch on point, Jim suggested how to implement this: modify the method org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelWeaver.dumpUnchanged to do nothing.
