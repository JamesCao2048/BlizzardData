[SWT] layout problems on mac
Doug, this might be an SWT issue in general (I notice that there are some minor layout problems on a few other dialogs, i.e.
find/replace on the mac has its combo boxes a little too close together), but the Keys preference page is the biggest offender.
As i've done nothing with the layout in some time, and you've recently changed the page by adding a tab folder, etc.
I'll let you have a crack to see if you can find the problem, otherwise SWT might know something about this already..
