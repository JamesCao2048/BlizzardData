Determine mixed order of libraries and source folders in class path for debugging
I want to debug my server application.
I am starting to debug my junit test.
Everything seems fine.
The test is marshalling arguments and calling the server.
The server says: unmarshal exception.
Probable reason: i have configured the source of whole project in eclipse.
Eclipse recompiles everything and uses its own compiled classes.
That may differ slightly from the classes/libraries on the server.
So I get the unmarshal exception.
O.k.
I could remove the source entry and use the correct library instead, but then I can not analyse and refactor all sources anymore and I do not want to 
create a new project for debugging and for developing.
(Besides that I already have to make a new eclipse project for each version control branch, and we have many branches.
This could be solved by a separate feature request.) So I would like to be able to add the source to the project but tell eclipse to take the library 
and neverless show the source at debugging.
If you think this features request is reasonable, perhaps you can give it a reasonable name, too.
