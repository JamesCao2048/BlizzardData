export plugin requires boot to be present
To export a plugin you seem to have to have boot loaded/available otherwise you get a dialog saying the system cannot find org.eclipse.core.boot. I am running M7, targetting M7 and have org.eclipse.osgi* and org.eclipse.core.runtime* as source in my workspace. I try to export any of these and get the above result.
