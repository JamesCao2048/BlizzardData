editor context menu|source|surround with try catch
Hi!
Nearly every method may throw a RuntimeException.
They will not be noted by the editor like other exceptions.
Nearly everywhere a programmer may want to catch them.
But the editor does not offer to surround them with try catch
like with other exceptions.
Would be a new features.
best regards
