Allow apps to specify multiple Shell image icons for different resolutions
Native windows apps can set both a small and large system icon for their windows (Shells), but SWT (Win32) only allows setting the small icon "decorations.setImage(Image)".
The small icon (generally 16x16) is used on the window decoration and the large (generally 32x32) is used for the Alt- Tab task switcher.
