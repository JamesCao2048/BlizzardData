Unexpected warning when launching Eclipse in Eclipse
Build 20031120 After importing all Eclipse plug-ins in self-hosted workspace, the target platform got set to point at my SDK install (which I imported).
Attempting to launch plugin Junit tests, I get notified that my workspace contains now twice as many plugins, is it ok to continue ?
I have the impression that it automatically append the plugins from the target platform, which I don't need as I have them all in my workspace now.
I don't recall this occurring before.
It should realize that on the target platform, there is nothing more than what I have already in my workspace and should take precendece over it.
