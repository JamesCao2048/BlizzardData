Searching in sequence diagram does not always scroll to the correct area

In the object or class interactions sequence diagrams, if you search for an
object or class for the first time, it works; the view is scrolled to that
object/class. But, if you search a second time (for a different object), it
scrolls to a seemingly random location that does not contain the object/class.
Or, it scrolls to the top left corner.
