NPE when searching in CU with incomplete method declaration
N20030915 class A{ native m(); } 
- select "m" 
- Refactor > Rename..., to "k" 
-> NPE in PatternLocator.matchesTypeReference() is logged.
This worked with the last I-build, even though the method has no return type.
The same NPE is thrown when searching for method declaration "m() int" in the search dialog.
