Global Cursor Position History for the editor
New Feature: Global Cursor Position History for the editor Should record the cursor positions and allow jumping forward and backward, even between several open files/within one open file.
More details+features, see below.
*** I proposed this as a feature for the kdevelop-project (KDE/Linux).
Perhaps something similar is possible in eclipse, too (port to Java).
My implementation in C++: stack: i Pos2 | Pos1 v | *---------------------* UP | DOWN | | history 
<<<<<-------- current 
------------>>>>
