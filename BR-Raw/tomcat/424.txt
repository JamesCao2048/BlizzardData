Global Cursor Position History for the editor
New Feature: Global Cursor Position History for the editor Should record the cursor positions and allow jumping forward and backward, even between sev
eral open files/within one open file.
More details+features, see below.
*** I proposed this as a feature for the kdevelop-project (KDE/Linux).
Perhaps something similar is possible in eclipse, too (port to Java).
My implementation in C++: stack: i Pos2 | Pos1 v | *---------------------* UP | DOWN | | history 
<<<<<-------- current 
------------>>>> future LEFT RIGHT NavigateBack(int &line, int &column); // Ctrl-Alt-Left for example NavigateLeave(int &line, int &column); // Ctrl-A
lt-Up for example NavigateForward(int &line, int &column); // Ctrl-Alt-Right for example NavigatePop(int &line, int &column); // Ctrl-Alt-Down for exa
mple Special features: 
- if navigating within a "block" of +/- 7 lines no additional history entry is inserted 
- if navigating back and then changing the cursor position, the "future" isn't deleted 
- NavigateLe
