CVS don't retry when the connection fails
(this "bug" matches at least all versions of 2 and 3)

This is how to regenerate the bug: 
- work correctly with a Java project mapped to CVS (do "update", "commit" etc.)
- do something to make the plugin not to find the CVS server (e.g. open a 
remote VPN connection or take the network cable off)
- make the CVS server available again (e.g. close the VPN connection or 
reconnect the network cable)
- do "cvs update" -> the software hangs and finally a dialog appears with "no 
connection to server".

It would be nice if one could do a reconnect with a button or something; now 
the only work-around is to close the Eclipse and start it again.
