Feature request: Allow more control over Debug view
It would be nice to exert more control over the Debug view.  For example, the
debugger I am writing is a multi-core debugger.  Multiple breakpoints can be
hit simultaneously.  The default behavior of the Debug view is to select a new
Stack Frame when a breakpoint is hit, open up the source code, and position it
at this line.  This is very confusing in the multi-core environment.  I may be
stepping through code when another breakpoint is hit, and suddenly I am staring
at a completely different file.
The control I would like to exert over the debug view would include:
1) Control whether or not selection occurs.
2) Control whether or not tree expansion/contraction occurs.
