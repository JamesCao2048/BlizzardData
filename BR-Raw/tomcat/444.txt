Display latest synchronize info at top of synchronize view
Currently the latest synchronize info is displayed in the status bar on the
bottom right.  Typically, I will have synchronize view in a fast view with
outgoing only selected.  Because the latest synchronize info is on opposite
sides of the screen, I sometimes miss that there are also incoming changes.
I would like to have the latest synchronize info displayed at the top of the
synchronize view so I don't have to remember to glance across to check.  Don't
care whether the info is also still displayed in the status bar.
