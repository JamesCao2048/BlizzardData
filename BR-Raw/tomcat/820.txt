Variable value should be displayed as hover tip when debugging
To reproduce: 1. Start a C program in the debugger. 2. Verify that you have a local variable with an assigned value in the variable view. 3. Put the mouse pointer over that variable in the displayed source code. Expected result: The value of the variable should have been displayed in a hover tip. Current result. Nothing happens.
