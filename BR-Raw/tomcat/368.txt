Possible serious performance issue
I make a habit of constantly running my Xray profiler on my runtime workbenches.
Today, I ran into a case where I loaded eclipse.
No editors open, just a navigator with a few hundred HTML files.
I selected one and deleted it.
Then, progress monitor pops up without any progress.
CPU is at 100% for almost 2 minutes.
As you can see from the included Xray report, 32 million objects were created, 1 gigabyte was burned on the heap and about 32MB was read from disk (su
mmary somehow missing in the report).
I can see when this happens to a large workspace that the user simply kills the eclipse instance (as I was close to doing).
I sent the bug report to Platform-Core as they would probably have the best insight into what happened.
The thread to look for is ModalContext.
No, I cannot replicate.
