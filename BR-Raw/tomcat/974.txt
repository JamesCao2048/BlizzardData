Display the detail when cvs commit in progress?
hi,
One day, when I run commit with eclipse cvs tool, the progress bar said
"operation in progress" and died there, I don't know what happened and which
file had been committed.
So, I think, displaying the detail of the cvs commit or such command what has
been done is impossible, especially to programmers.
Maybe a customized progressBar component needed?
Thanks!
