Display of a selected variable is not working frequently
Using 1105, the display of the selected variable is not working very frequently.
I am using JDK1.4.1 vms and I get numerous examples where I cannot see the string representation of the selected variable in the variable view.
This is very frustrating and it is wasting a lot of times.
I don't remember such issues with M4 or previous integration builds.
Sometimes after a while I get an error message instead of the expected display saying that the evaluation failed.
Debugging takes lot of time and patience.
