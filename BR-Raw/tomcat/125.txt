IDEApplication.checkInstanceLocation is throwing up an error dialog
There seems to be a problem with instanceLoc.lock() in this method in a runtime workbench (perhaps otherwise too?).
The .lock() method is returning false and then the checkInstanceLocation method drops to the error dialog and then fails.
The workbench cannot be started.
