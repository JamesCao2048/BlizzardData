LD error parser always assumes error conditions
The current ld error parser always assumes that information being reported is an error rather than a warning.
This makes statements such as: ld: warning: libcpp.so.2, needed by C:/temp//libdisplay.so, may conflict with libcpp.so.3 Cause red errors instead of y
ellow warnings =;-)
