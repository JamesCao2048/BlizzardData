Open Declaration opens class declaration for local variables
When the cursor is positioned on a local variable representing an object, and "Open Declaration" is selected, e.g.
from the pop-up menu, Eclipse opens the file where the variable's class is declared.
Instead, Eclipse should just jump to the position of the local variable's declaration.
When the local variable has a primitive type, nothing whatsoever happens.
