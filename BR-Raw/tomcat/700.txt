JTabbedPane - tabText should appear on JavaBeans viewer + feedback on drop should be more explicit
JTabbedPane.
The JavaBeans viewer should show the tabText for the page on the JavaBeans viewer so the user knows which entry corresponds to which page Also 
- on graph viewer drop the feedback for new pages is not that clear.
There is no visual feedback such as a rectangle or otherwise cue that a new page is being created.
One thing I like is the use of hover help in other feedbacks, so maybe we need to think about things like "Create a new tab page" appearing.
We could use this in other places as well in the JVE and just have more feedback to the user about what is going to occur after a drop rather than just drawing lines or highlighting GUI areas 
- sort of similar to what we already do for GridBagLayout and works well with row/column feedback but we could extend this to other areas
