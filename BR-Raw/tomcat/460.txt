Cursor Position indicator not updating after text paste
The cursor position indicator (in the bottom right hand corner of the status 
bar) does not correctly reflect the line number or line column that the cursor 
is currently in, having just pasted an amount of text into the Java source 
editor.

For example; with the following string, 

System.out.println("Hello World");

placed into the clipboard (using CTRL-C), and then pasting it onto a line 
(using CTRL-V), one would expect the cursor position indicator to update the 
column number; making its value the same as the original position plus the 
length of the pasted string (since the cursor is at the end of this string).

Instead, the cursor position indicator remains unchanged (until the cursor 
navigation keys are used to wake it up!)
