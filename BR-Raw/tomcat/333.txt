[ViewMgmt] Views' toolbar background makes buttons hard to see
The blue chosen for the background colour of the views' toolbars is to close 
in luminance to the grey used in disabled toolbar buttons.  Even some non-hot 
active toolbar buttons are hard to see.  For example the Back and Forward 
buttons in the Package Explorer view when disabled almost disappear.  Even the 
enabled Collapse All button is hard to see until you hover over it.
