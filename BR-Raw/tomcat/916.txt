JDT compiler more restrictive than javac
Here is the scenario that is causing problems to PDE when self-hosting against OSGi runtime: 1) Take M4 build 2) Download OSGi runtime from Equinox home page (build 1010) and unzip on top of the build 3) Start another Eclipse driver (not this one) with a clean workspace.
Configure it so that PDE->Target Platform points at the M4 OSGi build created in 2).
4) Import all the external plug-ins and fragments as binary projects into the workspace.
5) Create 'Hello, World' plug-in using PDE 'New Plug-i
