[CellEditors] ComboBoxCellEditor dismissed on first click in Properties View
When you click in the properties view on an entry that uses a ComboBoxCellEditor it will activate the cell editor correctly, but when you try to click on the dropdown, the cell editor is dismissed. You then need to click again to activate the cell editor again, and then you need to click the dropdown again, which fortunately works the second time. Any property that uses a ComboBoxCellEditor needs to be clicked four times to access the dropdown the first time. Every time a new input is passed to the properties view, the behavior is reset and four clicks are necessary yet again. One place to reproduce this is in the PDE's .exsd editor. EMF relies heavily on the properties view, so this problem is a serious usability regression that needs to be addressed before 3.0 is final.
