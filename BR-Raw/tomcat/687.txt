Configuration corrupted when eclipse opened twice
Whenever I mistakenly start eclipse twice, the configuration seems to get corrupted.

Now, whenever I open window > preferences, the tree is empty, the Updates View
throw an exception, etc.

Is there a workaround to get things up and running again? Other than by
reinstalling eclipse, that is.

I do not know if I should post the log since it is around 1.2MB long uncompressed.
