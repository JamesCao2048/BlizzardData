fragments not searched for classpath entries
In DefaultClassLoader.getClasspath() we are looking for a file to match a given
classpath entry.  Currently we only look in the bundle itself, we never
consider fragments of the bundle.  This makes the following interesting usecase
impossible
Bundle A manifest.mf
Bundle-Classpath: foo.jar
Bundle B manifest.mf
Bundle-Host: BundleA
where bundle A does NOT contain foo.jar and bundle B DOES contain foo.jar
