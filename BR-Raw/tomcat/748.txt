Autoformat inserts unwanted tabs when formatting javadoc
Hi, This has been occuring for a while in the 3.0 stream.
Using 'ctrl-shift-f' style autoformat will insert tabs ahead of javadoc comments even if the preference dialog is set to use spaces instead of tabs.
To demonstrate: Set up your prefs: Uncheck Java 
-> Code Formatter 
-> Style 
-> Insert tabs for indentation & Check Java 
-> Editor 
-> Typing 
-> Insert spaces for tabs It doesn't matter if you're using the old style formatter or have checked the new autoformatter in the Work In Progress shee
t.
Then select all in a java file with poorly formatted javadoc.
Tabs will be inserted.
