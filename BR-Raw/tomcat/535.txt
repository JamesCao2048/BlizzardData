Compiler warns on missing Javadoc tags for private methods.
The Java compiler warns on missing Javadoc tags for private methods.
The Style preference page has a checkbox to enable this feature for public methods.
So either the wording is wrong or there is a bug.
Perhaps, the access level could be specified for this *great* feature, from private all the way to public with public the default.
Thanks.
