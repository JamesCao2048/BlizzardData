Toggle Breakpoint action and key binding missing
build I20040317

(in Java editor in Java perspective)
- select a line of code
- Ctrl+Shift+B
- it has no effect
- go to Run menu, Toggle Breakpoint is no longer there
- go to Keys pref page, Run category
- Toggle Line Breakpoint is there, and is bound to Ctrl+Shift+B,  but noticed
that Toggle Method Breakpoint and Toggle Watchpoint are missing their labels.
