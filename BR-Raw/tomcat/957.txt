[Jobs] Should run progress views and status lines with one update job
Build 20030925 If the Progress view is visible and theres's a lot of background activity (e.g.
a long autobuild, or a CVS checkout), the whole Workbench freezes while the Progress view is updating.
Closing the Progress view makes the UI more responsive.
