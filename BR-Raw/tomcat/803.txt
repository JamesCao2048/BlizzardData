CDT failes to install: plugin and it's features unreachable
Only with gtk version on linux (motif): unzip eclipse 3.0M5 gtk version and after it cdt 2.0 gtk version, start eclipse.
The initial eclipse logo appears, disappears and appears again, eclipse creates the workspace and starts.
After this I can't reach any CDT functionality eg: new project, preferences, perspectives.
Motif version works fine, on the same machine.
Also eclipse 2.1.2 with CDT 1.2 works fine In the .metadata/.log: !SESSION dec.
