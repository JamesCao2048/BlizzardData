enable/disable builder bug - cannot cancel
* Open the "Builders" properties on a project.
* Select the "java" builder and press disable * press "Cancel" * open the builder tab 
- the builder shows as dislabed, although cancel was pressed.
It seems that the builder still runs too (until I actually press OK), which is doubly strange.
