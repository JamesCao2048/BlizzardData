progress dialog would stay forever
i200402101200
Got two Progress Summary modal dialogs at the same time one, waiting for a
background operation, did not show any jobs to be cancelled. The other, in
foreground, was waiting for "Refresh Workspace" (I have it enabled) although
"Building workspace" appeared in the job list. Please see screenshot and VM dump
(to attach) for details.
When I realized it was not coming back (no CPU activity) by itself, I tried
cancelling the selected job. That removed it from the list of jobs, but the
progress dialog remained open. Only cancelling the blocked job made the two
dialogs go away.
