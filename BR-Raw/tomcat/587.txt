Help refers to non-existent Go To button in Bookmarks view toolbar
Workbench User Guide>Getting started>Basic tutorial>Bookmarks>Using bookmarks
says 2. From the view's toolbar click on the Go To toolbar button.
This button doesn't seem to exist. I just installed Eclipse and
don't think it's likely that I've customized it away.
