Refresh produces duplicate on case rename
Eclipse 3.0M7, Windows XP If a package is renamed, but only changing the case, in Windows explorer, then when refresh is pressed package explorer will have both versions of the package.
Probably a Windows only problem.
1) Create a package called testCase.
2) Create a class called Test, but have the package line as "testcase".
3) Go to Windows explorer and change the package to "testCase".
4) Click refresh on the project.
5) There will now be two packages "testCase" and "testcase".
