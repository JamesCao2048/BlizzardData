[implementation] IllegalArgumentException: Argument not valid
i20040303 Selected a type in the "Open Type" dialog, and pressed ok.
The type was not opened in an editor.
Got an error dialog.
Title is "Error Executing Command", message is "The command for the key you pressed failed", reason is "Argument not valid".
After that, the editor did not redraw anymore, keeping the contents of any window that was in front of it before.
After closing the editor, everything seemed to work properly.
