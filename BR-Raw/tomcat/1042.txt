Quick diff results vary after reloading
Eclipse 3.0M2 Writing a quick diff provider that uses a remote file as reference, it looks like the quick diff view is providing different results after reopening the file.
Example: Reference: 01: /** 02: * First Line 03: * Second Line 04: */ If you delete the "second line" (03) then insert a line in front of "first line" (02), you get the following result: 01: /** 02: * 03: * First Line 04: */ 02 and 03 will now be highlighted as "Changed lines".
If you close the file and reopen it, line 02 will be displayed as "Added line" and at the bottom of 03 will be a "Delete line" indicator showing 02 and 03 as deleted content.
