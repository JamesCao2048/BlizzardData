Add variable expansion for Main Class in launch configurations
Java Application and Java Applet launch config delegates should implement
variable expansion on their Main Class and Project fields. This would allow
generic launch configuration "templates" that support the re-use of common
arguments in launch configs.
There may be the need for contributed variables from Java and Applet plugins
that support these variables.
