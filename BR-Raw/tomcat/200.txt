[breakpoints view] have an option to request feedback when deleting breakpoint with a condition/hit count
it's very anoying if you - in the hurry of things - remove a breakpoint by 
accident with the del-key that has a complex condition.

it would be nice to have a feed back on the deletion of those breakpoints, è„¿ la 

this breakpoint has a condition/hit count. do you really want to remove it?
[remember my answer]

i dont think its necessery to have this feedback also wghen invoked via context-
menu
