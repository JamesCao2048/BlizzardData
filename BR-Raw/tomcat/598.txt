[source lookup] Call stack editor annotation ambiguous
Build: 3.0 M6 If I have two threads suspended with the same method somewhere in their call stack, I cannot distinguish between the two because both are highlighted in the same way in the editor. I would expect only the call stack of the selected thread to be displayed in the editor (not the stacks of all threads).
