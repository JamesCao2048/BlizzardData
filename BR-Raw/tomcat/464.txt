Overview does not agree with sequence diagram view
WSWB 3.0 Hyades build 20040202_1722 When opening a medium-sized sequence diagram (~25 columns, square), the overview does not always agree with what's displayed in the view.
If you scroll to the center of the diagram, the red square is in the center of the overview, but the diagram in the overview has moved to the left.
The overview diagram should remain fixed, while the red square moves around.
I will provide a link to a profiling file containing a suitable Object interactions diagram in the following comment.
