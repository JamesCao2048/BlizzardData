[Sharing Wizard] Resize on sync page
M8 candidate
I always find myself resizing the sharing wizard when the last page is shown.
Basically it's unusable with the default size. There are two options:
1. provide better default wizard size, or
2. resize wizard when sync view page is shown
I seem to recall that jdt refactoring does wizard resizing when showing the
preview of the changes.
