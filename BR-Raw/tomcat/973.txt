- open Java editor in Debug perspective (or any other layout where the editor is surrounded by other ViewParts) 
- move scrollbar thumb slowly up and down Observe: sometime the editors contents shows other parts of the workbench window.
BTW: sometimes this happens when opening editors as well: before the editors contents is shown arbitrary other regions of the workbench window become 
visible for a brief moment.
