search in working set does not work across projects
project A and B opened.
working set contains only project B.
in project A, some class x, has e.printStackTrace() in it.
right-click "printStackTrace", search reference in working set above (B).
it returns no results, although the project B contains many printStackTrace(); goto project B, find an example of printStackTrace, and search again but in workspace.
Returns results (granted you create some!)
