@throws reference incorrectly warned as not declared
This happens in an overriding method which has a @see reference to its superclass method: File X.java: import java.io.IOException; public class X { pu
blic void foo() throws IOException {} } File Y.java: import java.io.IOException; public class Y extends X { /** * @throws IOException * @see X#foo() *
/ public void foo() throws IOException {} } Referenced class IOException in @throws tag is warned as not declared as it is obviously not true...
