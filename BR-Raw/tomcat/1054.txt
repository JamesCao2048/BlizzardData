Working directory block should have 3 radio buttons
The working directory block (on the arguments tab) is non-standard.
The check box below the control enables the controls above it.
Instead, there should be 3 radio buttons: local dir, workspace dir, default.
The description of "default" should update based on whether there is an associated project.
