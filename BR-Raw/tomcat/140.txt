no program-name available when attaching to an agent
Holger Machens:
---------------
I'm implementing an own profiling agent for special purposes. If the
agent is listed in the "Attach Java Process" wizard the process is
always called unknown. We need a way to tell the RAC the right name of the
process the agent is running on.

-----------------
The 'unknown' label in the Attach Java Process" wizard is used if the
process does not have a name property set on the
org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.Process implementation.

The 'unknown' process name is always used when attaching to a Java process
(e.g. local or remote).  If the user is launching a Java process (e.g. local
or remote), the entered process (e.g. class name) is used as the process name.
