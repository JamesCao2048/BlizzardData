pde.core does not compile
Build: N-20031206

Note; This build is unusable for many reasons, but that is not the issue here.

1. Use I-20031203 as development platform, and N-20031206 as target platform.
2. Launch on a new workspace.
3. Check out pde.core from CVS.

You will see that pde.core does not compile anymore, even though its manifest 
does contain the dependency on org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.

Not sure if it's a problem with Equinox restructuring or the JDT compiler.

Here is the compilation error, which did not occur when compiling against 
previous Equinox builds.

The type org.eclipse.osgi.service.environment.Constants cannot be resolved. It 
is indirectly referenced from required .class files.
