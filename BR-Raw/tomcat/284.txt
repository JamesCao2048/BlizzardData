can not launch "runtime workbench"
Using M7 as a development environment, I can not run "Run ...
runtime workbench" with last weeks integration build (I20040226) as the target.
I get the following message in log.
I marked as "blocker" since I'd think this would be a common way of doing development on Eclipse (that is, use milestone build as development platform, and latest integration build as target).
I would be surprised if not already found, but I couldn't find existing bugzilla.
A workaround would be appreciated.
BTW ...
