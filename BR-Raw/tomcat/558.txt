BiDi bug: SWT controls flip the alignment if SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT style is set.
If SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT style is set, some SWT contols also change the alignment direction.
If the alignment is right, then set SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT style, we see the alignment becomes left, and vice versa.
This never happen on J2SE Swing.
Swing does not change the alignment, even if the component orientation is RTL or LTR.
Steps to reproduce: 1.Download the following files on http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php and install them: eclipse-SDK-3.0M6-win32.zip eclipse-examples-3.0M6-win32.zip 2.In the example, set RTL_SUPPORT_ENABLE = true in org.eclipse.swt.examples.controlexample.Tab.java in org.eclipse.swt.examp
le plugin.
3.Rebuild org.eclipse.swt.example plugin.
4.Launch "SWT ExamplesSWT controls" view 5.Click "Button" tab on the SWT controls view 6.Change "Size" to "100x100" 7.Change "Alignment" to Left.
8.Change "Orientation" to SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT and SWT.LEFT_TO_RIGHT.
9.You can see the visual alignment is also flipped.
The alignment should not be changed, whatever the orientation setting is.
In addition, I see the same problem in the following cases: "SWT ExampleSWT controls" view: Button, Label, "SWT ExamplesSWT Custom controls" view: CLabel Test OS: Windows2000 SP3 Test Java platform: Sun Java2 SDK 1.4.1_06
