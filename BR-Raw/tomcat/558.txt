BiDi bug: SWT controls flip the alignment if SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT style is set.
If SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT style is set, some SWT contols also change the alignment direction.
If the alignment is right, then set SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT style, we see the alignment becomes left, and vice versa.
This never happen on J2SE Swing.
Swing does not change the alignment, even if the component orientation is RTL or LTR.
