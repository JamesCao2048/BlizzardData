ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in DeadlockDetector.lockAcquired
build I20031121 OK, so my build is somewhat out of date.
However, maybe this is still relevant.

- did a sync 
- selected two projects and did an Override and Update 
- it started smoking the cigarette 
- selected some more projects and chose Update 
- still smoking 
- the progress view didn't indicate anything was happening 
- console had: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1 at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.DeadlockDetector.lockAcquired (DeadlockDetector.java:265) at org.eclipse.core.i
