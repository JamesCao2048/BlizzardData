Eclipse locking when creating a new dir or executing an ant script
I'm using suse 8.2, with eclipse 2.1.2, with tomcat plugin (not used when the error occured) Sometimes eclipse locks when executing ant scripts, but i
t unlocks after canceling.
The locking when creating a directory is even more critic, since it locks (with clock cursor), and cancel button does not work (it becomes disabled af
ter pressing it), and when I try to close the windows it gives the msg : "wizard can not be closed due to an active operation.
you must cancel the operation before you can close the wizard" I got another lock, that I can't exactly appoint what task I was doing when it occured.
But it gave me the following stacktrace !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 0 Nov 19, 2003 13:53:48.509 !MESSAGE Widget is disposed !STACK 0 org.eclipse.swt.SWTEx
