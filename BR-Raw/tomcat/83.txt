[code formatting] split in expressions by operator precedence
- set maximal line width to 80 
- insert this main method: public static void main(String[] args) { int aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa = 0; int bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb = 0; int cccccccccccccccc = 0; int ddddddddddddd = 0; ddddddddddddd = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa * bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb + cccccccccccccccc * ddddddddddddd; ddddddddddddd = (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa * bbbbbb
bbbbbbbbb) + (cccccccccccccccc * ddddddddddddd); } 
- format the code (Ctrl-Shift-F) The code formatter takes care about operator precedence defined by parantheses.
It does not seem to care about the operator precedence defined by the language.
This should be optimized.
