Need to be able to provide an imported package.
Currently the framework does not allow for a bundle to provide a package that
is imported.  This means that a bundle will not be able to provide a package 
that it also exports if the framework chooses a different package version to 
make available to the framework from another bundle.

The search order for provided packages should be enhanced to include looking in 
a bundles imports for a package that it provides.
