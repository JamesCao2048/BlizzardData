Ant Editor preference to disable loading of external dtd or schema
From  bug 44125 :
I think that the issues can be related to XML parser used by the editor and DTD
or scheme definition linked from an XML file. My PC is behind a firewall, so
parser always fails to load external DTD or schema (i.e from bea.com or sun.com
or w3c.org) but it take a while to complete.

Please disable loading of the external DTD's and Schemas or make this a
configurable preference.
