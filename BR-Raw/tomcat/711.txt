[KeyBindings] Provide availableInDialog property on key bindings
Provide a read-only property -- availableInDialog -- on key bindings.  This
property should be available to developers, but not visible to the user.  It
indicates when a key binding is appropriate for use in the dialog.
(this enhancement is just so i don't forget)
