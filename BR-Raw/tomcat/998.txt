JDT package explorer doesn't trigger decoration for java files
This is with build 200308261317 and earlier I have a plugin which provides a custom lightweight decorator.
In plain old navigator view, if I expand a directory with a bunch of files, the decorations appear as they are calculated if the resources don't already have decoration.
However, in the package explorer, if I expand a package to display source files, my decorator does not get triggered (breakpoint in decorate() never gets hit) to update the resources that don't currently have decorations.
