[KeyBindings][MenuMgmt] Quick fix (Command+Q) quits Eclipse immediately on Mac
The keyboard shortcut for Quick Fix is Command-E Command-Q, command q is the quit command
so trying to invoke quick fix causes the app to quit. I tried to reassign the key but the UI for the
keyboard shortcuts in preferences is messed up on the mac (filed under another  bug #50126 ).
Version - 3.0M6
There is nothing in my .log file.
