No need for "plugin.xml" strings in platform.xml
When generating list of plug-ins in platform.xml, PDE currently writes paths pointing to plugin.xml, for example, "plugins/org.apache.ant/plugin.xml". It should instead write plugin location like: "plugins/org.apache.ant/" - for plugins running from a directory, "plugins/org.apache.ant_1.0.0.jar" - for plugins running directly from a jar.
