[Perspectives] Open Perspective action shows too few to choose from
When I click on "Open Perspective" button, I often get only one
perspective to choose from, in addition to "Other...". I find this
quite annoying. Makes me move my mouse and click twice.
Especially when the dialog that pops up show so few perspectives that
they easily fit in the original list. I know progressive disclosure
and showing me all the options are conflicting design tradeoffs, but
I'd suggest to reconsider the use cases. I press "Other..." so often,
in fact, more often than an offered choice, it makes me wonder. This
button is really a role-switcher. Make it easier to switch roles?
