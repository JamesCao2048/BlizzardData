[DetachedView] Undocked/floating windows looses position
When I undock my package explorer in one perspective onto screen/monitor 1 and places it at a specific position. I then switch to debug perspective and then back again, the unlocked/floating window is placed in the exact same position as I left it in. If I place the floating window in screen/monitor 2 however, the window appears to the far left on screen 1 (possible in position 0,0). This means everytime I switch to and from the debug perspective, I have to move my package explorer undocked window back onto the second screen. Expected result: The floating/undocked window keeps its position when switching perspectives even if it was positioned on screen 2 as it does on screen 1. I Have only tested this on Linux Redhat 9.0/KDE3.2 using SWT GTK. Except not using this feature, I don't see a simple workaround to keep the window positions.
