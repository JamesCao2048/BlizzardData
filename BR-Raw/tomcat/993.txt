problem with various dialog boxes: some data fails to appear + errors reported
When I try to open varuious dialog boxes (such as create new project, or change the settings under Window->preferences) entries in the dialogs fail to
 appear and a window pops up stating errors have been written to an error log (which I can't find!!).
STDOUT has the following data: Unhandled exception caught in event loop.
