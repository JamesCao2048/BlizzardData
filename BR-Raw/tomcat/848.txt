Generalize Type: Cancel does not seem to work [refactoring]
20031119

1. create a selfhosting eclipse workspace that has all plugins as binary except 
jdt.core from HEAD.
2. open CompilationUnitSorter, and select the first parameter from 
method 'sort'.3. Invoke 'Generalize Type'. Press cancel.
4. The cancel button does not seem to have an effect, the operation finished 
the calculation.
The dialog should probably close as a reaction to cancel (The cancel button is 
directly on the dialog)
