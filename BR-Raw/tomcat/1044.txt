[Navigator] Close project doesn't remove plus icon
RC2 1. Open Resources Perspective. 2. Select a Project and close it. Notice that the plus icon remains. Try to click on the + icon and it goes away. Note, at one point I did get the icon to go away for the first project in the Navigator as a result of the Close action. I'm not sure what I did to get that to work, but it only worked for the first project.
