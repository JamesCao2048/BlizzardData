[Keybindings] Keybindings displayed but not working
We place a "Zoom In" action on our own menu on the menubar.  It is a global
action.  The editor provides the action handler which registers its ID with
the site's service.  The keybinding appears in the menu, but does not work.
The menuitem is working properly otherwise.
