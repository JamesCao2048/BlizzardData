[EditorMgmt] Blank outliner when opening/switching to editor
Build 20040303 
- multiple windows No exact steps sorry.
The problem is that sometimes when opening an editor (ctrl-shift-T) or switching to an existing one will bring it to front, but the outliner doesn't r
efresh properly.
It remains blank.
Usually, closing the editor and reopening will make the outline show up after a few attempts.
