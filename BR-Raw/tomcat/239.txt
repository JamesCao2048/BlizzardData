jardesc does not allow workspace-relative paths [jar creation]
All path specifications in a jardesc require absolute paths.
This causes problems such as this scenario: when we use cvs team integration, and we have different branches of the code line, we cannot use the same sandbox workspace folder name.
So for the trunk it might be called 'myworkspace_trunk' but on the new version branch it might be called 'myworkspace_v2-1_branch'.
Therefore a revision managed jardesc would have to be edited on each branch code line to use the folder name of the branch as
