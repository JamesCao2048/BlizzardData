jardesc does not allow workspace-relative paths [jar creation]
All path specifications in a jardesc require absolute paths.
This causes problems such as this scenario: when we use cvs team integration, and we have different branches of the code line, we cannot use the same 
sandbox workspace folder name.
So for the trunk it might be called 'myworkspace_trunk' but on the new version branch it might be called 'myworkspace_v2-1_branch'.
Therefore a revision managed jardesc would have to be edited on each branch code line to use the folder name of the branch as part of the absolute pat
h.
A Workspace-relative path could remove the need to specify the absolute path to the output jar, and internally resolve the absolute path of the worksp
ace such that if I say staging/myproject.jar, the logic would be relative to the specific workspace directory.
It might be a nice addition to support Eclipse variables as well in the path, like ${WAS_HOME}/lib/myproject.jar
