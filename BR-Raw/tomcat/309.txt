[KeyBindings] Keybinding Service consumes keystrokes for unregistered commands
My editor has no "Content Assist" action handler.
My editor's canvas does not receive CTRL+SPACE KeyPressed event.

But this is not the behavior we are seeing.
For We check whether the command has a handler (i.e., action) associated with it.
If it doesn't, then we don't eat the key.
We eat all keys that: (1) have a key binding currently in context; and (2) have a handler currently active.

Why do native Trees and Tables receive > CTRL+SPACE, but our Canvas does not?
Likely because a handler is registered for your part.
I'm just guessing, as I'm not sure of the details of your set-up.
Nope, we are not registering a handler
