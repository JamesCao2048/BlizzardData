JVM Abend when eclipse shutdown
User shuts down eclipse by clicking the X box in the top right hand corner and the JVM crashes.
Any suggestions as to possible causes?
Error log follows.
Note: This is an intermittent problem but it occurs enough to be a concern (approx.
1 shutdown in 50).
An unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the VM.
