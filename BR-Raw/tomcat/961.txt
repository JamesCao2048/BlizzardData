[formatting] Format comment option bug
This bug is for build 200309250800.
The option Code Formatter -> Comments -> Empty line before Javadoc tags, will
insert multiple line at each formatting (unless used the Clear all blank lines
is also checked).
Example:
Create test class and insert his method
/**
* Test line before javadoc
* @param args
*/
public static void main(String[] args) {
}
Press the format command and for each format another empty line will be added
before the @param tag.
The new formatting are much better then the one from 2.x but we need some
description of how to use it, like what kind of comments will be acceptable for
the formatter.
