[launching] Managing invalid launch configs
When the launch config index is initialized, we toss invalid configs from the
index (but leave them in the file system). Examples are:
(1) Configs with missing launch config types (due to missing plug-in)
(2) Shared Configs which are out of sync with the local file system (remain
tossed until refreshed)
Exceptions are logged to note the problems. However, the user is never notified
of the problems. Should we, and how do we notify the user of these problems?
(the problems are noticed by the debug core (non-ui) plug-in).
