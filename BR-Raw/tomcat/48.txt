Allow quick-correct Rename to fix Error tokens
When cutting & pasting or manually refactoring code, symbol name mismatches will often result in the same token being repeatedly marked as in error.
Automated 'bulk' renaming for such tokens would be highly desirable, but Ctrl-1 Quick Rename is not offered/ functional in such situations.
Request: Quick Rename is my most favored tool and I would like to have it usable at all times.
Perhaps even on its own key.
Minor comment: perhaps it's because I haven't saved/ compiled the file, but the quick fix offers only class methods and variable-creation fixes; the obvious parameter and local variable which would be the most obvious fixes are not offered.
Too many alternatives for one keystroke where the only useful only (quick rename) is not available.
Quick Rename is pretty good.
I like it (and want it) for use as a more powerful general 'local symbol reassigner' rather than just an occasional error-fix.
eg to reassign method functionality from 'paramX', to method-calculated 'localX', to 'this.x', to 'infoObject.x', etc.
There's solid use for this and we need something quicker than global refactorings.
Quick While Quick Rename would be effective if the tokens were correctly resolvable, and would be the idealto reassign such references occur though a correctly-typed and usable symbol exists
