Runtime Launch config shows splash screen/ignores -nosplash
I20040127
I use -nosplash but it insists on showing the splash screen. Note that same
command line argument works when used along with eclipse.exe.
Looking at what gets launched I see:
-nl de_CH -showsplash "c:eclipsedropsI20040127eclipse -showsplash 600"
It should honor my command line argument.
