AspectJ weaver API is not threadsafe
I am using the weaver API (mostly BcelWorld and BcelWeaer) in a multithreaded environment and ran into problems.
I tracked them down to some static variables in the BCEL library implementation that can cause exceptions in the weaver (signatures are not parsed correctly) when executed via mulitiple threads.
Maybe the weaver implementation can use the BCEL library in a threadsafe way to allow multiple threads working with the weaver API.
