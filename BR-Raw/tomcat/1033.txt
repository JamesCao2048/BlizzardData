keybindings not working in StyledText when in plugin (but working externally)
I have an SWT view that uses a StyledText control and binds ctrl-c to copy,
ctrl-v to paste, etc.  It works find outside of eclipse, but when I run it in a
plugin, it gets the keypress for the control key, but no subsequent keypresses,
so control-c comes in as just a press of the control key.  I have tried binding
SWT.HardKeyDown, but that doesn't register either.
I tried running the external app using the libraries in the eclipse
distribution, and it worked fine.  I also tried running the plugin in my regular
eclipse (instead of as a run-time workbench) and that didn't fix the behavior.
might this be related to  bug #40798 ?
I'm using gentoo with gtk+2.2.2 and eclipse build 200307230800
If anyone wants to test with my plugin, email me and I'll send it (it's a meg
and bugzilla seems to have trouble with my web browser's file uploading -- using
MozillaFirebird, BTW).
