F: Provide extensible and more flexible filtering in navigators
Valentina, please assign to me.

Currently, the filtering in the Hyades navigators is hardcoded. A common 
mechanism for all Hyades navigators should be provided. This will be done via 
an extension point element <filterSet .../> under the 
<navigatorExtensions .../> extension point. This extension specify a label, 
icon, navigatorID, implementation, and will allow filters to be declared as 
common, which means they appear directly in the navigator view's menu, and 
whether the filter set is enabled by default.

This functionality will be placed at the INavigator level, and will apply to 
all Hyades navigators. Content providers will be wrapped in a 
FilteredTreeContentProvider, which will consult all filterSet extensions and 
take care of the filtering.

The interface should also be updated to comply with the Hyades UI guidelines. 
Filters should also be general, and can include a broad category of items 
(hence the name filter set), rather than a single item type (e.g. Monitor).
