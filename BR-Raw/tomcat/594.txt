Create Patch wizard should remember path in file system
Each time I create a patch, I have to click on "Save In File System" and then
hit the 'Browse...' button in order to enter a path. This is tedious as I
usually put my patches into the same location each time.
The wizard should remember the user's last path in the file system if one has
ever been entered. Optionally, also the radio button's position could be
remembered, but this is less of a problem as only one click is needed to set it up.
