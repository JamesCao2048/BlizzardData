New Code Formatter pref page: Connection between items not visible [code formatter]
I200312162000
When editing comment formatting prefs on the new Code Formatter pref page there
are the following two preferences:
[ ] Indent Javadoc tags
[ ] Indent description after @param
If I uncheck the first one then the second one gets disabled. This connection
should be reflected in the UI:
[ ] Indent Javadoc tags
[ ] Indent description after @param
Note: same bug was on old pref page
