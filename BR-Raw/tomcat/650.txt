Source/uncomment does not work
M6, german keyboard layout, configuration: default.
The command source/uncomment has the key sequence Ctrl+ assigned, which does
not work with a german keyboard.
However, i also was unable to assign a more appropriate key sequence. Toggling
using Ctrl+Shift+/ does not work, either.
