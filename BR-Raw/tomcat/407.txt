[misc] Annotation roll-over action for Mark Occurrences removes sticky occurrences
200402101600: When clicking into the annotation roll-over icon for marked occurrence, the other occurrences lose their marking even when occurrences s
hould be sticky.
Steps: 
- Enable Annotation roll-overs 
- Enable Mark occurrences in file (also enable sticky) 
- In this code fragment: new ArrayList().size(); new ArrayList().size(); 
- set caret into "size" 
- set caret to end of line (occurrences of "size" stay marked) 
- hover over vertical ruler icon and click onto the arrow (tooltip: "size") => expected: occurrences stay marked and (selection is "size" or unchanged
) => was: occurrence on current line is still highlighted, all other occurrence marks disappear, selection unchanged
