Plugin desctivated after patching
Build 20030121 After patching jdtcore.jar (i.e.
replacing it with a newer version), I restarted my workbench on the same workspace, but the jdt.core plugin was desactivated (ass well as all its depe
ndents).
I had to delete .config file to be able to restart the workbench and use the Java functinalities again.
