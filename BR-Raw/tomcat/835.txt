new ParserMode required for a better CModel
A mode for the parser that follows includes but does not go into function
bodies need to be implemented. This will help us build a better CModel that
has cross reference information.
Building such a CModel could be made available for potential clients other
than the outline view. Building such a model could be made optional (through a
user preference) for the outline view because of the expected degradation in
performance.
