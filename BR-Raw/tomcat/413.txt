[Tasks] Problem with task list when deleting an element and description field is being edited
- Create a bunch of tasks - Click on the description field of one of the tasks. You are now editing a task description. - Click the delete button. The task list has now one element less, but the description test of the deleted task remains in the field, and the task above is invisible. As soon as the description field loses focus the list is back to normal and the invisible task is visible again. This does not happen if the whole task line is selected.
