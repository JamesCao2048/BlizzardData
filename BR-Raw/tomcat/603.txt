Breakpoint hit not reported on remote debug session
I try to debug a java application (Jboss in my case) with a remote debug
connection on Eclipse 3.0M6 (connection type "Socket Attach", remote JVM as well
as local JVM is sun 1.4.1_02)
I set a breakpoint with "Suspend Thread" attribute on a certain place within my
application. I know that the breakpoint is hit, because the remote application
stops, but the breakpoint hit is not shown in Eclipse, all threads of the remote
application are still shown as running.
When I change the breakpoint to "Suspend VM" everything works as expected.
