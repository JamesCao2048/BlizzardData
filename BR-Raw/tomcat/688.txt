[Key bindings] copy paste does not work among different launch configurations
When user runs an application, he may need to input some text in the
configuration window, such as specifying VM arguments.  

I noticed that when I tried to copy the text in one of the java application
configurations and paste it to the JUnit configuration. It does not work. This
only happens in Linux GTK platform, on Windows XP it works.

The steps to reproduce the problem is as follows:
suppose user already has 2 projects in configuration window, one is a java
application, the other one is JUnit test project.

1. select the java application in Configuration window.
2. select the Arguments tab, copy the text in the VM arguments field.
3. select project under Junit
4. select the Arguments tab, right click the mouse to paste the copied text.
Notice the paste menu item is disabled.
