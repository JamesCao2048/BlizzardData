[plan item] Improve file encoding support
Improve file encoding support. Eclipse 2.1 uses a single global file encoding
setting for reading and writing files in the workspace. This is problematic;
for example, when Java source files in the workspace use OS default file
encoding while XML files in the workspace use UTF-8 file encoding. The
Platform should support non-uniform file encodings. [Platform Core, Platform
