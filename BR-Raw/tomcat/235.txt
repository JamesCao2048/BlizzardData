See who commited a file in the Compare Editor in Eclipse 3.0
In Eclipse 2.1 I can see who commited a remote file in the Compare Editor (the one that opens when you double-click on a file name in the Synchronize View). It would be nice to have this in Eclipse 3 as well, otherwise I have to look at the revisions on the CVS server to see it.
