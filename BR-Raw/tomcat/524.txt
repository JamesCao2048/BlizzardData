Evaluation that hits breakpoint confuses debugging
Jdk1.4.1_b11
Source will be attached
Set breakpoints on lines 21 and 39
Debug to a breakpoint at line 21
From the editor, display, "this.hitBreakpoint()"
you hit the breakpoint at line 39, but the thread still claims to be
evaluating, no indication of the breakpoint
Hit Run to Return
You are back at line 21, but the thread still claims to be stepping, and the
stepping actions are not enabled.
Click resume and things are back to normal.
