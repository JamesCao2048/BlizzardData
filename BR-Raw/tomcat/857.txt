Extract interface from org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Layout
Is there a reason, why org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Layout became a class instead of an interface?
If one has to create an own layout imlpementation, having such an interface would often make that job easier.
My refactoring request: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Layout implements org.eclipse.swt.widgets.ILayout { // everything else is the same } Thus you still co
uld add methods and fields to them in the future.
The name of that new interface is up to you ;) br Saibel
