Problem with name collision in XML-schema generated models(?)
I have a fairly large XML schema (142 Classes, 133 DataTypes, 30 Enums, 549 Features, 1 Package) that I used to generate an EMF model (EMF 2.0.0_20031219 though I have the same problem with 2.0.0_20040127).
I'm using this schema to send and receive SOAP messages, and for most of my messages this works fine.
Unfortunately, for one type of message I'm seeing a strange exception thrown when I try to parse a particular XML document.
The failing XML is small, and correct by the schema:
