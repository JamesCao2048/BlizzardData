Show Compare result in synchronize view not good (for me)
I20040304 Since last I-build when I do a team compare I end up in the Synchronize view. This new approach breaks my existing working style: instead of getting a compare editor in the Java perspective where I develop code I am now forced to switched to the CVS perspective where I have the Synchronize view. What was the PR/feature request that caused this change and what is the benefit? Note: even if this PR is closed as wontfix at least the name of the view should change since compare and synchronize are two different things or (better) there should be a separate (Team Compare) view.
