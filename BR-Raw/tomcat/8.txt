[DND] Editor splitting, box moving.
I'm using a pair of datahands ( http://datahand.com ) with an integrated mouse and, while it is generally fantastic, the mouse does not offer sufficient precision to allow for repeatable box repositioning.
ie: it is not always possible to d&d an editor tab to the right border, as the arrow may not show up, or may only represent the other side of the border.
I have the same problems with window resizing, but that can be overcome by choosing size->[left|right|top|bottom] from the box menu.
A similar solution in the box menu for repositioning would be very useful, ie: reposition->[left|right|top|bottom].
