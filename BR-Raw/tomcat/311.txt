Yes indeed, thats what I'm saying.
Developing the plugin and running it by starting the runtime-workspace (spawns a separate IDE window) works ok.
But when restarting the initial IDE, invoking the plugin will cause the same NoClassDefFoundError.
Turning on the OSGI support did not work.
I'm able to reproduce the bug by starting in a clean environment,
