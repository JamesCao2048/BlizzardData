Badindentation and TAB key behavior after an opening parenthesis
I am reporting what I consider a new, flawed behavior of the TAB key in 3.0M5, as compared to the 2.1.x versions.
My test scenario: I enter a line in the Java editor which ends with a ( and hit ENTER.
In both 2.1.x and 3.0M5 the caret is moved to the following line (as expected).
However, 3.0M5 automatically inserts 2 extra tabs in that new line.
2.1.x does not try to outsmart me and places the caret at the indentation level, i.e.
start of the new line in context of the current block.
At this point I should mention that I want to indent the following line with just ONE tab.
Example: { someMethodName( arg1, arg2, arg3); // ok! } What 3.0M5 forces is: { someMethodName( arg1, arg2, arg3); // WRONG! } So to get back to prefer
red state in 3.0M5, I have to hit backspace 4 times after hitting ENTER (as I use space-for-tab substitution).
There is yet another related situation in which 3.0M5 "helps" to reduce my typing speed and temper.
Suppose that I place the caret at the block indentation l
