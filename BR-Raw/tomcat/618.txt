[new search] flicker when stepping through changes
1) enable new search
2) do a text search for "e"
3) step through the matches
->notice that the editor tab flickers (i.e., the editor is temporarily
activated). When the editor is already open it should not be activated when
selecting a match. The flicker doesn't occur in the old search
