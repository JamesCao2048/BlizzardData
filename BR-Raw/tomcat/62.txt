ClassCastException in LaunchViewEventHandler
The following code throws ClassCastException if 'element' is an instance of 'IStackFrame': protected void doHandleSuspendEvent(Object element, DebugEv
ent event) { IThread thread= getThread(element); if (thread != null) { fThreadTimer.stopTimer((IThread)element); } According to the documentation on '
DebugEvent' "no events are specified for stack frames".
But I think it would be better to cleanup this code.
