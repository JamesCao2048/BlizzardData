setHightlightRange() does not work
Build: I-20031118 1.Open the manifest editor on a plugin.xml file 2.Go to the source page.
3.In the outline view, select an element.
You will see that the correct segment of text is selected in the editor; yet, the highlight range was not set correctly.
In the same piece of code that does the correct selection, we also have the line: setHighlightRange(...) with the correct arguments, yet it is doing n
othing.
The range indicator for the source editor is an instance of DefaultRangeIndicator, which, as I understand, is also the default.
