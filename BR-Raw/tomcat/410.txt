[Fonts] Workbench Pref pages leak 7 fonts
How I did it:
With sleak and graphics-trace on:
Open Resource perspective; open sleak view; close all perspectives but resource
perspective; close all views but sleak view.
Close Eclipse.
Open Eclipse again.
We start w/ 52 colors, 2 cursors, 0 fonts, 1 GC, 86 images
For each pref page: open preferences select page in tree, close preference
dialog, reopen preference, close preference, note new resources.
Workbench: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 5 fonts, 1 GC, 87 images [+5 fonts (2 should be
loaded: Dialog Font + Banner Font), +1 image (banner) -> no leak]
Keys: 52 colors, 2 cursors, 9 fonts, 1 GC, 91 images [+4 fonts , +4 images -> no
leak]
