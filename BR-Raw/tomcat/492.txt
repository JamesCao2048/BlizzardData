Need access to Internal CDT class CView
I need to have access to CDT UI classes that are in internal packages.
org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.cview.CView;
- I want to selectReveal items in the CView.  I would prefer there be an action
(equiv. to JDT's org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.ShowInPackageViewAction) instead of
having to get the CView and then calling selectReveal.
We are currently on 1.2 but are planning to move to 2.0 soon.
Thanks
