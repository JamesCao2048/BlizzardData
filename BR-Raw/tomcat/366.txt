Cryptic Error Message from Platform Loader
I try to launch my runtime workbench.
Apparently, there is something wrong with my plugin.
However, all I get as a message is "Problems encountered starting up plug-in: "org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The BundleActivator org.eclipse.core.xray.Plugin is invalid".
What does that mean?
What is a BundleActivator?
Why is it invalid?
What can make it invalid?
I also get a java.lang.InstantiationException: org/eclipse/core/xray/Plugin.<init>()V, so something went wrong there?
What?
