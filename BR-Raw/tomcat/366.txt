Cryptic Error Message from Platform Loader
I try to launch my runtime workbench. Apparently, there is something wrong
with my plugin. However, all I get as a message is "Problems encountered
starting up plug-in: "org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The BundleActivator
org.eclipse.core.xray.Plugin is invalid". What does that mean? What is a
BundleActivator? Why is it invalid? What can make it invalid?
I also get a java.lang.InstantiationException:
org/eclipse/core/xray/Plugin.<init>()V, so something went wrong there? What?
2 other messages in the .log file are identical and similarly cryptic:
"Unhandled Exception", "An exception stack trace could not be found.".
Seems like someone is swallowing and translating an exception. I would
like to know what the original exception is, so I can debug my plugin.
