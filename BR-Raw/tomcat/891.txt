What JVM is Hyades using to run java processes?
(Hyades 1.1.0, Eclipse Workbench 2.1.1) When using "Launch Java Process", what JVM is Hyades using to run the process?
Is it supposed to use the same JVM as the Eclipse workbench specified with eclipse 
-vm startup option?
Or maybe the JVM specified in the system path?
My application does not behave correctly with JDK 1.4.I started eclipse with a 
-vm option to use JDK 1.3, but I have JDK 1.4 in my system path.
I'm not too sure which JDK Hyades is using when launching my application using Lauch
