[find/replace] Labels for Regex ContentAssist in Find/Replace should include example
Labels for Regex ContentAssist in Find/Replace should include the regular expression (before or after the describing string).
My use case is e.g.
this: I remember there was a pattern for word-characters (s, w, W, S, or something like that).
I press Ctrl+Space and resize the list to see half of the proposals at once.
Now, the label "alphanumeric" doesn't match my mental pattern, and I have to look at every single label.
The info hover takes a second to appear, and I get tired of waiting for it, because I know that I would have spotted w right away if it was part of the proposal label (e.g.
"Alphanumeric 
- w").
