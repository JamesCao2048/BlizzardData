Reverting file messes up breakpoint
Build 20040226 1.Place a breakpoint on a line.
2.Edit the file in some way (I added a blank line below the breakpoint.
3.File->Revert.
4.The breakpoint marker in the editor ruler disappears.
(first problem) The breakpoint is still visible in the Breakpoints View, however.
5.Double-click on the line where the breakpoint used to show.
6.A new breakpoint appears in the Breakpoints View, but it's label is shorter than the "zombie" breakpoint's.
It doesn't include the method name.
(second problem)
