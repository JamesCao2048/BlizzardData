can't find java.awt.* packages using IBMs 1.4.1 VM on linux
1. get swt and swt.gtk from head
2. rename appropriate swt classpath file
3. build
you get lots of errors that various java.awt files cannot be found.
for this vm and this platform (at least), the java.awt.* files are in
'graphics.jar'.
it seems like the contents of this file isn't being considered when looking for
imports?
