problems with projects having recursive links on linux
Overview Description: Eclipse has various problems with projects having recursive links on linux (e.g.
"ln 
-s .
core" created in the base directory of the project); sometimes resulting in system crashes caused by java.lang.OutOfMemoryErrors Steps to Reproduce: 1) create a project with the following structure: projectdir/src/Test.java with projectdir as the base directory of the project and Test.java as a simple java file without having a package delaration 2) in projectdir create a recursive link, e.g.
using cd projectdir ln 
-s .
core 3) import the project to eclipse with the following steps: 
- File 
--> New 
--> Project 
- Select "Java Project" 
- Choose projectdir as the Project contents, enter a project name and press the "Finish" button Actual Results: * 41 errors (The declared package doesn't match the expected package ...)! * try Search 
--> File Search with 
- Containing Text: Test 
- File name patterns: * which results in 41 search results * trying the same things in bigger projects multiplies the problems: a project having only about 100 source files tries to find search results in about 45.000 files; opening, closing, and deleting these projects sometimes results in system crashes caused by java.lang.OutOfMemoryErrors Expected Results: * recursive links should be ignored or handled somehow Build Date & Platform: SuSE Linux 8.1, Eclipse 3.0 M3 GTK (28 Aug 2003) System configuration: Athlon 2GHz, 512MB RAM,
