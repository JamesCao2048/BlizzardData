Remove all infopop plugins
In the interest of having less plugins, and being more like the Eclipse
platform, we should remove all our infopop plugins. The infopop .xml files
should be inside the user documentation plugins (*.doc.user), as they are user
docs. To see examples of this, see the following plugins from the JDT and PDE:
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user
org.eclipse.pde.doc.user
Note: We don't have a Doc component in Bugzilla like the platform and JDT..
should we create one?
