Source action to generate a default constructor [code manipulation]
From bug 49419 I also would like to see some additional menu items in the editor's context menu.
In the submenu Source, I wuold add some features: 
- Add default constructor 
- Add default destructor 
- Inherit from (only when I select a Class in the editor)
