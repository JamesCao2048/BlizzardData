[SSH2] Passphrase validation warning in wizard
The following behavior would be appreciated:
Empty passphrase/Empty confirm:
Typing in passphrase -> no error message.
Typing in confirm -> error message "don't match" (unless they match .)
Empty passphrase/Non-empty confirm
Typing in passphrase text -> error message "don't match" (unless they match .)

There could be a warning that not having a passphrase (i.e. both text fields are
empty) is insecure.
