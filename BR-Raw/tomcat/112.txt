Can't install CDT under solaris
In trying to install the CDT under solaris, I unzipped the files into the eclipse file hierarchy and tried using the help->software updates->update manager.
I can see the plugins in the features updates but when I click on them for preview, they are all in the 'disabled' state.
How do I enable them.
The CDT FAQ has been inadequate at explaining how to install this plugin.
I am using the 2.1.2 eclipse platform.
