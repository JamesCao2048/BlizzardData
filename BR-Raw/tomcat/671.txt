Eclipse 3.0M5 fails with NullPointException on startup
I'd tried different current builds, but can't get to work the M5 release or any other nightly/stream build.
After completing the install, while startup screen is displayed, the following Exception occurs: !SESSION 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Dez 19, 2003 13:36:11.281 !MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform: !STACK java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException at org.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoa
