getCharset should return parent's default charset when file does not exist
i20040318 Frédéric reported: "Currently, when I try to get encoding using getCharset() method on a IFile which does not exist yet, I got a CoreException. Is it normal? I thought it should give me the default encoding of its parent instead. If this is the expected behavior, this means that each time I want to get encoding on a file I have to write: String encoding = null; try { if (file.exists()) { encoding = file.getCharset(); } else { encoding = file.getParent().getDefaultCharset(); // get folder encoding as file is not accessible } } catch (CoreException ce) { // use no encoding } "
