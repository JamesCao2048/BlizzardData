Subclasses of TextEditor can no longer create custom SourceViewers
In 2.1M5, org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditor initializes a private field called fSourceViewerDecorationSupport inside of createSourceViewer. We're substituting a custom subclass of SourceViewer by overriding that method in our subclass of TextEditor. Unfortunately, this gives us a NPE when createPartControl is called later since TextEditor references that field in numerous places.
