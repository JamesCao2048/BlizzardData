[Coolbar] Open a workspace twice causes toolbar icons to disappear
On the latest I-Build I20040219 if I open a new workspace all the toolbar icons show up and work.
If I close and restart eclipse on the same workspace then all the toolbar icons disappear.
I can never get the icons to show up again unless I start with another new workspace.
