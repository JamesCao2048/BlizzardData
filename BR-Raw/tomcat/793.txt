iterator in clone() may provide a copy of arrayList in different order
in org.eclipse.hyades.logging.events:
some of the clone() methods uses Iterator to retrieve all the elements. This
was OK before since it iterates through a hashMap, which order does not matter.
However in CBE 101, it uses ArrayList instead of hashMap. By using a iterator,
we have clone a copy of the ArrayList which has elements in different order
than the original.
This is what stated in the sun javadoc:
public Iterator iterator()Returns an iterator over the elements in this
collection. There are no guarantees concerning the order in which the elements
are returned (unless this collection is an instance of some class that provides
a guarantee).
