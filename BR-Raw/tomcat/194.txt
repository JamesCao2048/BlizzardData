CCombo edited value is not preserved (when mouse selects another cell within table)
The problem is present and reproducible.
Following are details: We have a table with several rows.
CellEditors are CCombo type (editable).
When user starts changing the value of the cell and decide to move to another cell (by mouse click) the latest/edited value of the previous cell is not set.
The same problem is not present if these cells are Combo type.
This look like CCombo bug.
