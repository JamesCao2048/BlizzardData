600% progress?
I20040318 (the second one) If I perform a CVS update across several progress, the % complete progress indication goes up to x00%, where x is the number of projects being synchronized. For example, if I select one file in each of five projects (say, the .project files), the progress goes up to 500%. If I only update a single project at a time, the numbers look fine.
