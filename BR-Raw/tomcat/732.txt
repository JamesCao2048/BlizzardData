[RCP] Move icons from IDE to workbench
GEF would like to require only RCP.  The UP and DOWN Icons are available,
internally only, in the IDEInternalWorkbenchImages class.
Can you consider:
a) making icons public so as to avoid duplication or internal API
b) moving appropriate icons from IDE to non-IDE.
