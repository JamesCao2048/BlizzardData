[search] Search results with details (show matched line)
The current search results do not show the actual line that matched the search. 

Suggest that the search results be a tree with the filename as a node, and the 
lines that match within that file as the children of that node. 

Also suggest that search have an option specifying if the method name should be 
displayed or not in the search results.
