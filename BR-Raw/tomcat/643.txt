Source control folders should not be visible in package view
When using folder based source control e.g.
CVS and Subversion, the CVS folders appear in the package view of the application.
I'll try and do a simple ACSII drawing of this Assuming your source is in src you get + src + CVS 
- empty + foo.CVS 
- empty + foo.myPackage 
- has content + foo.myPackage.CVS 
- empty All the CVS entries should not be present, they should be ignored as they're not valid packages.
Same applies to .SVN folders if your using subversion.
You probably should be able to configure eclipse to tell it what files to ignore.
