parser/indexer ignores stand-alone header files
If I create a stand-alone header file inside my project (e.g.
a class declaration with all inline methods, so it does not require a .cpp for the body) the header is not indexed, and consequently the type informat
ion is missing from the "Open Type" dialog.
It might be debatable whether non-#include'd external headers should be picked up, but I think header files inside a project should always be indexed,
 regardless of whether they are #include'd or not.
