NullPointerException in Search
20020602 (F2) I don't think I can repeat this, but I will try.
For now, here's what I did, and here's the stack trace(s) from the log.

- Did a Java Search in an SWT working set for a field called SWT.ON_TOP.

- Looked at a few results (which opened a few editors) 
- Closed the editors 
- Decided to do a File Search for the string ON_TOP in the same working set (to do this, I simply clicked on search again and clicked on the File Sear
ch tab 
- the search field was already filled in for me).

- I got the following walkbacks in my .log: !SESSION Jun 05, 2002 21:55:25.304
