Manifest builder taking a very long time to perform
Build 20031119 Restarting an existing workspace with this build, autobuild off, I forced an incremental workspace build, and got surprised by the amount of time spent in the manifest builder.
It took about 20-30 seconds on one project, and pretty much traversed all the Java projects in less time than that afterwards.
Setup is full source Eclipse workspace.
