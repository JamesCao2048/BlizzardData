Double click Shell title bar to maximize the shell cause StyleText selection changed
Hi, When I double click Shell title bar to maximize the shell, and after Shell maximized, if the mouse is over StyleText control, will cause StyleText selection changed. My env is Windows XP, jdk1.4.2, eclipse 3.0 M5. Thanks Eric
