Emacs key bindings do not work with C editor
When using the C editor with CDT 2.0M7, the key bindings for text editing are
not used. It appears that the C editor uses the "In General" key bindings
instead of the text editing key bindings, as enabling the Emacs key bindings set
has no effect. For instance, typing CTRL+A should normally take you to the start
of the line, instead it selects the entire document (windows style).
Admittedly this is minor but is an annoyance if you're used to using the emacs
key bindings with Java :)
