I20040324 - start Eclipse with a fresh workspace - On the introduction page, download the SWT samples - Select Stand-alone SWT launcher The wizard imports the org.eclipse.swt.examples and org.eclipse.swt.examples.launcher projects. Problem: these projects are marked as depending on the org.eclipse.swt project which is missing. The projects don't compile and can't be used.
