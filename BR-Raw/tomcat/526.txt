Import plugins shows org.eclipse.ui.win32 before org.eclipse.ui
Build 20020508
In the list of plugins in the import wizard, org.eclipse.ui.win32 is before
org.eclipse.ui in the order.  Should use Collator.getDefault() to sort the
strings (only get this once -- it's expensive).
Or, use ViewerSorter's collator.
