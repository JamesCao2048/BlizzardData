JUnit and the green color [JUnit]
Well I am checking out the Eclipse M6 stable and got a bit disapointed about the color of the most important(!) green bar of the JUnit TestRunner.
The color looks awful.
I am missing the bright and sunny green bar, where is it?.
Best would be to add a color picker for every color possible in the preference page of the JUnit plugin.
Whouldn't be that hard to implement I guess 
- I've read the contribution book, therefore I know what I am speaking about *g ;-).
Well to summerize it, * Current green bar looks awfull dark, but I need it to shine sunny and bright to encourage me! (and my folks too ;) * Best would be to add a bunch of color properties to the property page of JUnit Thanks for considering, Martin (Kersten) PS: Who the hack likes that dark one?;) Someone made that change and had to clap his shoulder in selfconfidence.
(I've never meat one who likes that kind of green) My System: Win2K, Eclipse M6
