Errors in plugin.xml cause compilation errors
Hi there, I don't know exactly if this is a bug or more a RFE.
If you write a plugin and edit the plugin.xml so that it doesn't correspont to the XML schema, you'll get hundreds of compilation errors in your java files.
There's a single error message that your schema isn't valid, but normally because of the huge amount of errors, you can't see it.
It would be nice if the schema check occurs first and if the schema is invalid, you get an error message and the following compilation step doesn't find place, so that you see that there's a schema error and have to fix it.
