[java debug] Automatic disconnect after N timeout exceptions
I was remote debugging and I was then presented with a resume failed 
- I think when I hit play in debug mode 
- and then hitting the details button a message told me to check my log which kept on growing with these same messages until I killed my remote app.
Eclipse was unresponsive until the remote app terminated.
