adding project xml file when Finishing project creation
(Eclipse Release 3.0, Milestone 7) Test environment: AIX 5.3, CDE, using the JVM that came bundled with Eclipse, Mozilla (most recent version I could find for AIX). This was discovered during verification of Release 3.0 Milestone 7 on AIX. The following was taken from the testing matrix given to verify Eclipse: *** Description: Finish *** Test Case: 7.7.2.1.3 *** Actions: Check JUnit project and press "Finish" *** Desired Results: A new file ""plugin.xml" is added to the project tree *** Results: Fail. *** Details: It adds a .jar file instead. NOTE: perhaps the testing matrix is incorrect?
