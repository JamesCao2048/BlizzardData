background colors in labels for warning/errors/csv status
Actually label decorations for warning/errors/cvs conflicts are only represented by a small icon or a ">" sign. Sometimes it's really difficult to see such small labels, expecially if you have more decorations. Allowing users to select a backgroung/foreground color for labels will really improve user experience. A similar feature is currently implemented in instantiations codepro, but only using custom views (they call them package explorer+, resources+). It sound strange to reimplement views only to add a (also if useful) background color... it would be really great to have a support for this feature available in the base UI framework, so that could be used in any view. This is a screeshot from codepro colored view: http://www.instantiations.com/codepro/ws/docs/images/package_explorer_plus_view . gif And the preference page where users can choose colors: http://www.instantiations.com/codepro/ws/docs/images/preferences_browsers.gif This would be a nice addiction in the new [workbench]->[colors and fonts] preference page just added with the new look'n feel.
