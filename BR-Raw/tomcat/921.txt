Workbench Help set on wrong Composite
In BuildPathsPropertyPage and SourceAttachmentPropertyPage the Workbench Help is set on the parent Composite passed to createContents(Composite parent
) rather than on the control that is returned from getControl().
As a result the Help for the preference page cannot be used in when performHelp() is called.
In JavadocConfigurationPropertyPage and JavaElementInfoPage the Workbench Help is set on a different composite, but still not the control that is retu
rned from getControl().
