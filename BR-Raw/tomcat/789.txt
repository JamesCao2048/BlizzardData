Expose dialogs for creating classpath entries
This is a request to provide non-internal access to the dialogs used to create classpath entries within the JDT UI.
These would be simple dialogs or perhaps even just helper methods (e.g.
IClasspathEntry[] showExternalJARDialog(Shell shell)) that could be used to present the user with the same dialogs and return a classpath entry.
Specifically, the dialogs that appear by clicking on the following buttons on the Java Build Path properties, Libraries tab: Add JARs...
Add External JARs...
