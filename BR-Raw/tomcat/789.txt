Expose dialogs for creating classpath entries
This is a request to provide non-internal access to the dialogs used to create
classpath entries within the JDT UI. These would be simple dialogs or perhaps
even just helper methods (e.g. IClasspathEntry[] showExternalJARDialog(Shell
shell)) that could be used to present the user with the same dialogs and
return a classpath entry. Specifically, the dialogs that appear by clicking on
the following buttons on the Java Build Path properties, Libraries tab:
Add JARs...
Add External JARs...
Add Variable..
Add Library...
Add Class Folder...
Exposing these dialogs would allow downstream JDT users to create and edit
classpath entries outside of the regular JDT dialogs. For instance, providing
a UI to set a server's classpath in an editor.
Currently, this is done by duplicating the dialogs. Maintenance of duplicate
dialogs is an issue, as well as a usability problem since the dialogs are
inevitably different.
