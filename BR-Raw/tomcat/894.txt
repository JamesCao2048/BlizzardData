Multiple ISaveParticipants to plugin
Currently Eclipse allows only a single ISaveParticipant implementation to be 
registered to a plugin. Not sure the reasoning behind this.   It would be nice 
if they allow multiple ISaveParticipants to be registered to a single plugin.  
For example we want to have an ISaveParticipant that stores the classification 
of a resource to a file and also another ISaveParticipant that stores the maps 
and generation list for a resource.  Since we cannot register both we are 
forced to introduce a single SaveParticipant that we register our own 
WRDSaveParticipant objects to.
