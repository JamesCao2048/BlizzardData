setEditable() method doesn't work
The following solution is used to make the editor readonly or locking it so that no one can write in it.
I am using the following method in JavaEditor example that is extending CompilationUnitEditor.
public void setEditable(boolean editable) { ISourceViewer viewer = getSourceViewer(); if (viewer != null) { viewer.setEditable(editable); } } this did
n't work and then I got another hack from Andrew about getting the sourceviewer after the creation of the editor.I do get the viewer throught that but
 I still can't get the seteditable method do any work.I used the following way of getting the SourceViewer() .
IWorkbench workbench = PlatformUI.getWorkbench(); IWorkbenchWindow window = workbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow(); workbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow()
; IWorkbenchPage page = window.getActivePage(); IEditorPart part = page.getActiveEditor(); if (part instanceof CompilationUnitEditor) { CompilationUni
tEditor editor = (CompilationUnitEditor)part; ITextViewer viewer = (ITextViewer)editor.getAdapter(ITextOperationTarget.class); } when I call viewer.se
tEditable() here after the creation of the editor through a button nothing happens.
There are couple of things that I have read about it.
Frist how am I sure if the getActiveEditor does get me the editor I am typing on.If I use getSite() the above doesn't let me use it,or gives me a Null
PointerException.
Secondly everywhere in the archives I have read that everyone is calling getSourceViewer().setEditable(); But in my case I can't call that.
I think lately Jared had the same problem of gettiing a Null value when he use to call getActiveEditor where I think you reaplied that in 3.0 getSite 
and getPage() should be used.
I am using 2.1 right now as I can't use 3.0 as I have to do a lot of changes.
