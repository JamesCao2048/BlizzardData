Editor tab has "User File Editor" instead of "plugin.xml"
I20031029 
- create a new environment 
- check out some projects from CVS 
- import external plugins 
- open a plugin.xml file with a double click from the Search window 
- PDE's multi-page editor opens fine (with pages for Overview, Dependencies, Extension Points, Source, etc.) 
- by default, the Source page had the focus 
- the editor's tab in the titlebar of the Editor window had "User File Editor" when I was expecting the filename "plugin.xml"
