[Tasks] Stale marker in problems view
In build I20031021, my Problems view contains a Java problem marker (compile error) that no longer exists. Clicking on the marker results in the following message appearing in the log. !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 Oct 21, 2003 10:55:51.113 !MESSAGE Error accessing marker type !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.resources 4 376 Oct 21, 2003 10:55:51.114 !MESSAGE Marker id: 21682 not found. The view could catch this error and remove the stale marker.
