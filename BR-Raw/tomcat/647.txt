[KeyBindings] Space now erroneously runs Completion
Ctrl-Space has run "Complete" until now, but now Shift-Space does also, and I
have not noticed that before, so I think that is new in either M5 or M6.

This is a rather annoying default since I frequently enter text where I need to
press shift just before or after a space.  The change means that I cannot just
keep shift down.
