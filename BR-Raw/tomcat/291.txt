Display keybinding for default close action in debug popup
The keybinding associated with the 'default debug popup close action' should
be displayed in the debug popup. We could show the keybinding in brackets at
the end of the action label - "(CR)", or experiment with modifying the label
to say something like "Press 'key-binding' to XXX", where XXX is the original
action's label.
