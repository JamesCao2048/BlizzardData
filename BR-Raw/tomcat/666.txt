GTK fires additional events than Windows when selecting a Combo item
When running org.eclipse.swt.examples in package controlexample, I selected 4 kind of event listeners for Combo widget: Selection, defaultSelection, FocusIn, FocusOut. Then I click the combo and select a different item. The event console shows 4 events in the following order: FocusIn, FocusOut, Selection, FocusIn Repeat the same steps on WondowsXP, 2 events are fired: FocusIn, Selection.
