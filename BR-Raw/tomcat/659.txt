[JUnit] The "Runs", "Errors" and "Failures" fields accept keyboard focus
Click on the "Runs" value displayed in the JUnit view.
A blinking caret will appear.
Because these fields never contain more than a single, at most two numbers, it does not seem that you need to support keyboard focus for copy/paste's 
sake.
I tested on Linux GTK 2.2.4, but I guess that the same problem will be reproducible under Windows, too.
