progress, background operations, and novice users
Build I20030304 There has been much discussion elsewhere about insufficiently visible progress indications for builds.
I'd like to raise a more general issue about the kind of feedback that will help novice users of Eclipse.
If it helps, think of my mom as the user (you can imagine that she's not too comfortable with computers<g>).
The problem is that when the user performs any command that will complete sometime later in the background, whether it be build, synchronize, or whate

The reason why its so important for the novice is that they expect the commands they give to happen in the background (a more sophisticated notion).
Novice users are more familiar with simple turn-taking
