Sharing a project - Module exists reported when it doesn't
I'm using WebSphere 5.1.0 and I am trying to Share a project with CVS. It is a brand new project and when I try to share it I get the error that the specified module already exists when it doesn't. It is like it is not even trying to do the cvs import. I am running a cvs server on a Solaris 8 machine. I can connect and work with the cvs server using other cvs clients and the import happens fine. Let me know if there are more details that you require. Sorry if this is a duplicate. Mike Slywka
