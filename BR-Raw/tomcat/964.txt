Large Strings (8036 bytes) don't display correctly in console window with XP ClearType turned on
If microsoft ClearType is turned on in XP sp1, large strings in java don't 
display correctly in the console or main editing windows.  By large, I mean 
like 8096 bytes.  Works fine if ClearType fonts are turn off (which is the 
default)and large strings sent to the console window will appear correctly.  
Turn cleartype back off and behavior will be seen again.
Here is the procedure to turn cleartype on and off in xp sp1.  It's very 
simple and makes fonts look great and easier on the 
eyes.  " http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm?fname =%

Other than this minor annoyance, smaller more reasonable strings work 
fine...just hugh strings fail.
