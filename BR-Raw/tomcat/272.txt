Problems not removed after fixing
Using Eclipse 3.0M7+EMF 0225_1234SL If I create a new XSD file, and add the following: 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<schema xmlns=" http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " xmlns:test=" http://www.example.com/test " targetNamespace=" http://www.example.com/test "> 
</schema> there are no reported problems as expected.
If you add 
<element name="foo" type="string"/> to the schema, all is still well.
Change the type to "bar".
A problem is correctly reported.
If you then comment out the element statement with 
<!-- and 
--> surrounding it either on separate lines or enclosed within, the error remains.
The location of error does not match the layout of the file.
If you close the file and re-open it, the errors are gone.
