Ctrl-Backspace performs wrong function
I'm using 3.0 M3 with JDK 1.4.2 on Windows XP.
The Ctrl-Backspace key sequence is bound to "Delete Previous Word" but when typed it actually performs "Delete Next Word" (which is correctly bound to Ctrl- Delete).
There appears to be no way to get the "Delete Previous Word" action to actually do the right thing.
This is a regression from 3.0 M2, which worked fine.
