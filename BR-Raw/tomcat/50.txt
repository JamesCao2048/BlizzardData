Bundle name is not returned as translated string
Bundle.getHeaders().get(BUNDLE_NAME) returns the bundle name as it appears in the plugin.xml.
If the name was %pluginName (i.e.
the pluginName is a key in plugin.properties), the result is %pluginName, but I was expecting to see the actual value out of plugin.properties.
My workaround is to call Platform.getResourceString(bundle, bundle.getHeaders ().get(BUNDLE_NAME)) to get the translated string.
