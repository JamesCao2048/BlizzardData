Pane does not refresh in setSelection
On Linux-Motif dirver,
Try to do a Find in Log Interaction view, see the view scroll bar scrolled, but
the view is not refresh with the scroll. but if closing the Find Dialog, the
view refresh and see the selected graph node.
I am not sure if this is SD or SWT related.
