[Plan Item] Improve UI scalability
Improve UI scalability.
Despite efforts to ensure UI scalability with a large base of available tools, the Eclipse workbench still intimidates many users with long menus, wid
e toolbars, and lengthy flat lists of preferences.
This problem is acute in large Eclipse-based products.
The Platform should provide additional ways for controlling workbench clutter, such as further menu and toolbar customizability, distinguishing betwee
n novice and advanced functions, supporting different developer roles, and more specific object contributions for particular file types.
