Lock granularity of Team > Actions
While I was commiting a project I wanted to delete another project which was 
not related with the commit. However I had the windows showing that my 
workspace was lock.
It seems to me that the granularity of the lock is too coarse. Maybe it is the 
lock on delete, but I just wanted to make sure that you knew about it too.
