Deferred creation of Table items
Creating large Tables (10,000 or more items) in SWT is currently very slow and memory-intensive.
It would be possible to improve the runtime if the SWT Table could request TableItems via a callback when they first become visible rather than requiring all TableItems to be created in advance.
This would also allow Table to reclaim the resources for TableItems that are no longer visible.
Alternatively, the SWT Table widget could provide a Listener interface that sends notifications when rows gain and lose visibility, allowing some higher-level object to implement a deferred creation strategy.
