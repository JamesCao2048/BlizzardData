[Navigator] Provide ability for users to add filters to base UI Navigator view interface
Problem/Feature Request: In the base Navigator view (e.g.
as in Resources perspective) there is no way for the casual user to add their own filters.
Workaround/Warning: As an unofficial "workaround", you can edit {WebSphere Studio Install Dir}eclipsepluginsorg.eclipse.ui_2.1.1plugin.xml ...

<extension point="org.eclipse.ui.resourceFilters"> 
<filter selected="false" pattern=".*"> 
</filter> 
<filter selected="false" pattern="EJS*"> 
</filter> 
</extension> ...
to add a filter in the base workbench/eclipse Navigator View.
In this case I added the "EJS*" filter.
It works, but is not officially supported.
You can use this at you own discretion.
However any core workbench problems reported with any such change present are not be supported.
At the current time, the only sanctioned way to add a filter to the Navigator view, is to create separate plugin and contribute the filters instead of modifying an existing product plugin.
The UI is a separate plug-in in core Eclipse which happens to own this base Navigator view.
WebSphere Studio Workbench or Eclipse development does not support any modification to the base.
The UI plug-in is part of that base.
Example: In WSAD v5.x there is a large set of filters in the base Navigator view.
The various plug-ins added these through a plug-in api()...etc.
The good news is that apart from this sanctioned mechanism to add filters to the base Navigator view, adding a filter to the plugi-in.xml file of the UI file will ony affect the Navigator view.
This change does not carry over to say the Explorer Package view of the Java perspective or the Project Navigator of the J2EE Perspective.
Similarly any change to filters in a custom Navigator, such as adding a filter in the J2EE Project Navigator, will not show up in the base Navigator view.
There is a clean and logical separation of concerns in the design.
Clearly, writing a plug-in is not an option for many users or an activity they may wish to invest time in to just a filter(s).
Our customers raised the need to be able to add filters to the base Navigator for general use across all perspectives.
This basic add filter capability is present in base Navigators of other IDE technologies.
I have create this eclipse bugzilla defect/feature request to provide a add/remove user filters capabilty in the UI Navigator GUI (e.g.
an add filter button at minimum,and maybe a remove button restricted to filters not associated with a plug-in).
