Generate Getter/Setters is broken in M5 [code manipulation]
Choosing the Source->Generate Getter/Setter action seems to be broken.
I tried explicitly choosing the class in the outline view, but it doesn't seem to help.
Tried in several different classes, and tried a restart of the workbench, but still the same effect.
Major PITA.
