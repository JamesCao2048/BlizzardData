In M6 cannot get Plugin for a given class
We have used some code for a couple of years now.  This code will take a class
and get its ClassLoader.  It checks if the class is a PluginClassLoader and,
if so, it gets the Plugin for this PluginClassLoader.  Now, when we move to
M6, the ClassLoader for the class is an EclipseClassLoader.  I don't see a way
to get back to the plugin that loaded this class.  Am I missing something or
is this not possible anymore when using osgi?
