[RCP] [ViewMgmt] want to have the possibility to dynamically change the tab name of the view for multiple view instances
on Eclipse RCP V3.0M7, it is possible to open dynamically multiple instances of a view : showView ( String view Id, String secondary Id, int mode) the text shown in the tab of the view is tne name of the view defined in plugin.xml ( <view name=".." ). When you open several instances of a view, all of the tabs show this text. The problem is that it is not possible to modify programmatically this text. It is possible to see it but not to change it : IViewpart.getViewSite().getRegisteredName() gives the name of the view Is it possible to have the setRegisteredName (String name) function ??
