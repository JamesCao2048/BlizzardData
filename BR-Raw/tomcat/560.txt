[SSH2] Keyboard-interactive authentication support has not been supported.
My original eclipse-cvsssh2 plug-in has supported the keyboard-interactive authentication, but that functionality has been dropped at http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.team.cvs.ssh2/src/org/eclip se/team/ccvs/ssh2/JSchSession.java.diff?r1=1.5&r2=1.6 Can I hear the reason about it? And, is there no plan to support it again? The keyboard-interactive authentication will be very useful for enterprise users, who require SecurID and S/Key, etc., authentication to get accesses to their sshd. I know how to support it, but some modifications will be required in org.eclipse.team.cvs.core and org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui and I'm not a committer for them. So, I must ask for help if I will.
