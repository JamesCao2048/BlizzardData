[EditorMgmt] Loss of editor pick drop-down
I200403100800 I love the new editor drop-down, even more when it gets a key binding.
But sometimes I can't access it anymore.
Clicking on the editor tab doesn't make it appear anymore.
The last time this occured was when I split the editor area to have two editors side by side, then when I stacked the editors back the drop-down didn't appear anymore.
