[Workbench] level of detail option for view title bar
One of the common new look gripes is that if you have a view pane with several
views, and the tabs for those views don't fit, then the inactive views "fall off
the end" and are no longer visible.  This is made worse by the extra space used
by the curvy active tab.  Many applications solve problems like this by making
the information displayed in tabs configurable (text only, icon only, or both).
The initial configuration shows text to help out the novice user, but the
advanced user can turn off the text and just use the icons.  This would allow
you to have quite a lot of views within a pane and not have them "fall off the end".
