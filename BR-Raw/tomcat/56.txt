OK ...
so here i I'd like to be able to detect and distinguish a CTRL+click on a toolbar button.
I found this post http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform.swt/msg08937.html but I don't think I can have such control as I am contribut
ing Actions to a toolbar manager, and the ToolItem widgets are instantiated for me ...
