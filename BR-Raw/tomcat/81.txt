Missing Running/Dead thread events creation and times of of currently created thread events are absolute times
Here are few remarks (and more ?) about Thread Events model loader.
1/ I think "Running" thread event at thread start time: I have added this in XMLthreadStartLoader.java (see patch file below).
2/ Same thing for "Dead" thread events when a thread ends: I have added this in XMLthreadEndLoader.java (see patch file below).
3/I have also changed all "setTime( time )" for the fourth XMLmon*.java file to "setTime(createDeltaTime())", seems to have better result in thread vi
ew (I prefer to see 10/20 s times rather than 1.079E9 seconds ! ;-) ).
Here a patch file for the 3 points above, it's created using Eclipse CVS "create patch" command at org.eclipse.hyades.models.trace level: Index: src/o
