No file entry in popup window for project
I have eclipse-platform-2.1.1-linux-motif CDT 1.2 Full for Linux/Motif, installed under plugins After creating a project and opening the context menu (right mouse button) of this project under the C/C++ perspective, there are only the entries New -> Project New -> Other So there is no choice for creating a new file.
