[EditorMgmt] Pressing 'Esc' while editor drop-down list is open kills the list
I pressed 'Esc' key while editor area drop-down list was opened. I managed to kill (close & dispose) the list shell and I could not open it again. I had to restart Eclipse to restore it. Expected behaviour: the list shell should be hidden but not closed and disposed completely.
