Eclipse won't startup
Ecplise was running when I had a power failure and now it won't startup again.
the message I get is to check the .log file for possible reasons why...I have attached the .log file.
Thank-G-d I had my work backed up...and I then even re- installed eclipse by downloading the most recent version, but I still get the same error even 
though I had no workspace dir to begin with after the re- install.
What's up?
