Eclipse crash leads to unreadable workspace
I've been helping SWT with  Bug 49936  and  Bug 49942 .  This bug is starting to
cause frequent crashes of Eclipse.  This morning, starting Eclipse after a crash
last night, I get three errors at start-up, and none of my projects appear. 
Trying to import the projects leads to a "Workspace is closed" error dialog. 
Trying to shutdown leads to a "Workspace is locked" error dialog, and Eclipse
does not exit normally (i.e., it leaves behind the ".metadata/.lock" file).

The start of the craziness appears to be:
"org.eclipse.core.internal.dtree.ObjectNotFoundException: Tree element
/org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor/bin not found."

So, two questions come out of this:
1.) Is it really necessary to fail with such a workspace?
2.) If a failure occurs with such a workspace, why is the ".lock" file left
behind on shutdown?  (i.e., if the workspace can't be read, should the user be
allowed to reconstruct a new one -- rather than needing to manually delete the
old one on disk?)

My workspace has been zipped up, and is available for inspection.  The problems
occur on I20040114.
