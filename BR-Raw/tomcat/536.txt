MessageBox locks out application
The following scenario causes SWT to lock under SWT for windows.
A parent shell X is created and opened.
Then, a text entry dialog Y (a child of the X) is opened titled "X".
In this scenario, given the nature of the dialog, it is of style APPLICATION_MODAL.
At some point while Y is open, the application must present an important error message.
So, a MessageBox Z, also a child of X (or Y, same effect) is created and opened titled "Z".
MessageBox Z will of course stay on top within the application
