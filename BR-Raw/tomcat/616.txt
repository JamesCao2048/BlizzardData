eclipse won't start under Solaris using eclipse 2.1.2.1.
After installing on Solaris 8 eclipse does not run.
I believe the problem is because the java command in jre/bin is just a script containing the line: .java_wrapper .java_wrapper looks parses $0 and uses it for progname: progname=`/usr/bin/basename $0` On our system progname was set to .java_wrapper and eclipse failed to run because: prog="$APPHOME/b
in/${proc}/${ttype}/${progname}" # Run.
if [[ 
-x "$prog" ]] then # Calling: exec $DEBUG_PROG "$prog" "$@" exec $DEBUG_PROG "$prog" "$@" else echo >&2 "$progname was not found in ${prog}" exit 1 fi Changing java to be a hard link to .java_wrapper solved this problem.
