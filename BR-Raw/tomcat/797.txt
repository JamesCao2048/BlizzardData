Ant view icons for default target confused with Java protected decorator.
The little blue triangle which overlaps the target is confusing since in the
Java view the blue triangle means protected. Just a thought: You could use the
same running-man decorator to mean default target that is used also used to say
"this class has a main() method". The current icon means "protected" target, to
me, at least ;-)
