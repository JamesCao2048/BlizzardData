Zoom Out action is enabled although it doesn't do anything
1) Make your diagram big enough so that zooming to "Page" would require a zoom
level that is less than the minimum.
2) Set the zoom level to be the smallest possible from the drop-down combo
box.
3) At this point, the zoom out actions will be enabled.
4) However, clicking it won't do anything.
This is because canZoomOut() -- which invokes getMinZoom() -- takes the "Page"
zoom setting into account.  However, when getPreviousZoomLevel() is invoked, it
just returns the previous setting from the array of zoom levels, and ignores
the "Page" zoom setting.
