[Global Sync] Global sync and workspace population
It would be nice if we could tie global sync to workspace population, at least
for CVS. When I started up an empty workspace, the global sync button was in
the toolbar. Selecting CVS gave me a page which stated there were no CVS
projects in my workspace. It would be nice if the user was given the
opportunity to create repository locations and checkout projects at this point.
I don't know if we want to have the checkout part of the global sync wizard in
general but it would be really helpful if it was part of the no-project case.
