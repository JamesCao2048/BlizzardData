[content assist] Incorrect cursor position after code assist
The cursor is left in an incorrect position after choosing an option (using Enter key) from the code assist pop-up.
Create a class, Test, with a main method.
When using code assist inside the main method for class/method completion (not template expansion), the cursor keeps being positioned to one of: 
- after the closing brace of the main method, 
- after the closing brace of the class, 
- last character of the file.
The cursor should end up after the text chosen from the pop-up.
Template expansion works OK.
Tried with code assist preferences both on "completion inserts" and "completion overwrites".
Cursor positioning has worked correctly on longer classes.
