Changing the style of a Label from SWT.SHADOW_IN to SWT.SHADOW_NONE does not make a difference in the appearance of the Label
When I was going through the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples- 3.0M7.zip) which I downloaded from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse 
- examples-3.0M7.zip, I realized that changing the style of a Label from SWT.SHADOW_IN to SWT.SHADOW_NONE did not make a difference in the appearance of the Label.
Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario: 1.Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11.2.Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse 
- examples-3.0M7.zip and install them.
3.Launch Eclipse 4.Select “Window 
-> Show View 
-> Other…”.
This will launch the “Show View” Dialog.
5.From the “Show View” Dialog, select “SWT Examples 
-> SWT Controls”.
This will display “SWT Controls” View.
6.From SWT Controls View, select “Label” tab.
7.In the “Styles” group, make sure SWT.SEPARATOR, SWT.VERTICAL and SWT.SHADOW_IN options are checked and the rest are unchecked.
8.In the “Other” group, make sure both “Enabled” and “Visible” options are checked.
9.In the “Size” group, make sure “100 X 100” is selected.
10.From the “Styles” group, select SWT.SHADOW_NONE option.
This will uncheck the SWT.SHADOW_IN option.
Expected Behavior: The appearance of the Labels should change Actual Behavior: The appearance of the Labels remains unchanged Important: When I ran the same tests on Eclipse 2.1.2, the outcome was the same as it was on Eclipse 3.0M7.
