Changing the style of a Label from SWT.SHADOW_IN to SWT.SHADOW_NONE does not make a difference in the appearance of the Label
When I was going through the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples- 3.0M7.zip) which I downloaded from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse 
- examples-3.0M7.zip, I realized that changing the style of a Label from SWT.SHADOW_IN to SWT.SHADOW_NONE did not make a difference in the appearance of the Label.
Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario: 1.Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11.2.Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Exampl
