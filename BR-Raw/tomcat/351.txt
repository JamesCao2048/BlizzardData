[KeyBindings] KeySupport.java should support localized key sequences
Translator had a question about the need of certain strings to be externalized.
Key values are in English in the Keys Preferences page.
Steps to recreate: 1.Select Window 
-> Preferences 2.Select Workbench 
-> Keys 3.Select any item in the Commands box 4.Press the pull down button next to the Key secuence field Question from translator: We observed that the keys are displayed in English, however there is a file named: eclipsepluginsorg.eclipse.ui.workbenchworkbench_jarorgeclipseuiinternalc ommandskeysupport.properties that seems to contain the translation for the keys.
Should these keys be translated or should they be displayed in English?
