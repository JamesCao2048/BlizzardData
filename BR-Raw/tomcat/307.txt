[EditorMgmt] dropdown: too hard to drive
The new editor drop down is too hard to drive.
editor selection now requires: 
- moving the mouse to the (rather small) down arrow/triangle, 
- clicking 
- choosing an editor by name of the file 
- clicking again This significantly breaks the workflow.
driving to the little drop down area requires me to stop what I am thinking about and concentrate on aiming.
As a first step I suggest a) make clicking anywhere in the entire "gray" area around the editor tab cause the drop down to appear.
