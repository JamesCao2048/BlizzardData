[EditorMgmt] dropdown: too hard to drive
The new editor drop down is too hard to drive.
editor selection now requires: 
- moving the mouse to the (rather small) down arrow/triangle, 
- clicking 
- choosing an editor by name of the file 
- clicking again This significantly breaks the workflow.
driving to the little drop down area requires me to stop what I am thinking about and concentrate on aiming.
As a first step I suggest a) make clicking anywhere in the entire "gray" area around the editor tab cause the drop down to appear.
This simplifies aiming b) having some modifier key that just brings up the list at the current mouse position (e.g., Alt and button down or some such)
 c) accelerators for choosing editors (I looked around but did not see anything in the menus etc) The related issue is choosing by name.
This problems here are a) requires you to know/think about the name of the thing you are looking for b) the combo is quite cluttered because the entir
e path of the file is displayed with little visual separation c) users are unable to leverage their spatial abilities (i.e., I usually just know where
 the editor I want is but really don't know what the name of the file is) I don't know what to do about this.
Perhaps all that empty space in the fast view docking area can be used to put editor icons with really fast hover help showing the real name.
left unsorted or permitting user arrangement users could develop a spatial model?
