Incorrect result when using refactor to rename interface method.
The following test case is self-explanatory.
=================== public class Test { } interface I { // Use refactor to rename this method to m2.void m(B b); void m(C c); } class D implements I { // This method gets renamed to m2 (OK) public void m(B b) {} // This method also gets renamed to m2 (BAD) public void m(C c) {} } class A {} class B 
extends A {} class C extends A {} ===================
