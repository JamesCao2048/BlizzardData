Import filter type will not reduce to xml selection
When you try to import files into a java project you can not select xml files to automatically be included when trying to reduce the filter selection when selecting the filter types. Trying to add xml to other extensions does not work as xml disappears from the list. Other extensions added to the other extensions seems to work fine.
