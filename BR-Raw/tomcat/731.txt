[compiler] Enhance unreachable code detection
I'm not sure if this use case is already included in the 3.0 enhancements but 
it is not recognized in 2.1.2. Thus, I'm adding it to bugzilla.


public void myMethod()
{
    boolean performOK = false;

    [some opertations that never modify performOk (no write access to 
performOk)]

    if(performOK && .....)
    {
        // this code will be unreachable 
        // jdt compile can recognize this but doesn't in 2.1.2
    }
}
