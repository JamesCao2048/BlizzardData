When comparing with CVS, show the commit comment
Now, when I want to sync with the CVS, I see the list of files,
and for each file I can double click on it and see the differences between my
version and the version on CVS.
I would like to see the commit comment of the CVS version I compare with,
especially when there are only incoming changes, or when there are conflicts.
(It is less informative to show the comment when there are only outgoing
changes).
