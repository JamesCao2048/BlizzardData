[Workbench] Two debug views
I20031218 0955 I got into a state where there were two debug views tiled together (see attached image).
When I closed one debug view, the other tab remained, but the view content area was blank.
I then moved another view into the group (console view).
When I closed the console view, the remaining debug view was back to normal (showing usual contents in content area).
