multiple beginCompoundChange in LinkedUIKeyListener
build used: eclipse-SDK-I20040210-win32 I noticed some strange undo/redo behavior in the JDT Editor.
I don't have a simple testcase to demonstrate the problem in the JDT Editor.
But, I noticed if I set a breakpoint at the implementation of IRewriteTarget.beginCompoundChange, it's called multiple times while I'm in the linked e
dit mode of Local Rename (one time for each keystroke).
But, endCompoundChange was only called one time at the end.
I traced and noticed the origin of the multiple beginCompoundChange calls came from the LinkedUIKeyListener#controlUndoBehavior(int, int).
LinkedUIKeyListener is an inner class in LinkedUIControl.
I understand org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.link is an internal package.
But, I hope the developer may agree that it's a simple problem to fix.
That may avoid some hard- to-explain problems in the future because of this unmatching beginCompoundChange/endCompoundChange calls.
Here is a copy of LinkedUIKeyListener#controlUndoBehavior(int, int).
