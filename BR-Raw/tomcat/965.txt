No refresh when deleting edited unit
Build 20030930 in working copy owner mode If the file being edited is deleted from the package explorer, then the view doesn't update.
If the file isn't updated, then it correctly disappears.
The difference is that an edited file is in primary working mode for which no delta is broadcasted (virtual file system notion).
However, the editor closes itself and discard the working copy which should then notify a removal delta.
