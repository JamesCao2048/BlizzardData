Build Path & Runtime Path inconsistent WRT Library/Container
In the build path (project properties->Java Build Path) groups of jar files are referred to as Libraries (i.e.
Add Library button).
In the runtime classpath (Run->Run...).
The launch configuration editor refers to (what appears to be) the same thing as 'Container' (Advanced...
button, Add Container: radio button).
