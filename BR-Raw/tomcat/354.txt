Workbench.compatibility and 3 friends pulled into RCP launch config
In the run-time workbench launch configuration, on the Plug-ins tab, I select Choose plug-ins and fragments to launch from the list, put a check mark next to my RCP plug-in only (org.eclipsepowered.rcptutorial3), and click on Add required plug-ins.
These three plug-ins get added unnecessarily: org.eclipse.ui.workbench.compatibility org.eclipse.core.resources org.eclipse.core.resources.win32 The plug-in is not marked as working with older platforms (pre 3.0) and it has no dependencies on the deprecated api that is in the compatibility fragment.
