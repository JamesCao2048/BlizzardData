after failed move IFile left in a bogus state
20030813
after a move operation failed ("copy successful but failed deleting resource")
i'm left with an IFile that returns 'false' to 'exists()' but
its 'location.toFile().exists()' returns 'true'
this state results in a ResourceException when i try to create another file
with the same name
because of that, CreateCompilationUnitOperation.executeOperation() assumes that
the file does not exist and does not ask to 'force' when creating the file.
major - our test suites suffer from this
