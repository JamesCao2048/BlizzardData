Background color problem
When changing the background color on the Java > Editor > Syntax page from "System Default" to "Custom", and then selecting a solid black, many of the Eclipse edit control backgrounds that display code, such as the "Externalize Strings" wizard's "Context" edit control and the Templates edit controls
, don't make use of that black background.
This makes the contents of those backgrounds difficult to read.
