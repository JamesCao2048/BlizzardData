Need better error message for "can't find type
I have experienced situations where IAJC outputs a message like this at the
end of compilation.
[iajc] can't find type org.xxx.SomeTest
In my case this was one time highly confusing since I did not expect the class
in question to be referred anywhere in the project (I have to date still not
located the reference).
For such cases, it would be extremely nice if the error message would display
WHY it need the class (i.e. the name of the refering class(es) or aspect(es)
possibly with a reasonable cutoff as there is seldom need to list all
referals). So I would like a message like this:
[iajc] can't find type org.xxx.SomeTest referred by
org.yyy.SomeClass,org.yy.SomeOtherClass ...
