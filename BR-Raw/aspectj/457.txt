AJC possible bug with static nested classes
AJC fails to find nested static classes during binary-weaving analysis if the
classes have been previously compiled with J2SE5.0 javac compiler with
options: -source 1.5/ - target 1.5
Note, that the nested static classes are not necessarily subject to bytecode
weaving - AJC merely fails to detect them in the JARS for its analysis.
This issue disappears when the .java sources are pre-compiled with -
source/target 1.4, regardless if the javac compiler comes from the J2SE1.4 or
J2SE5.0 distribution.
This issue is distinct form  Bug #71548 , since no 5.0 source code processing is
required from AJC ever.
