error Type mismatch: cannot convert from java.lang.String to java.lang.String
When compiling a binary concrete aspect library (for later LTW) consisting of
more than one aspect that performs an ITD on a target class not exposed to the
weaver I get the following error:
error Type mismatch: cannot convert from java.lang.String to java.lang.String
The error does not oocur if a complete build & weave is performed. Testcase
attached.
