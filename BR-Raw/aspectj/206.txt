Add an option to generate aj-synthetics with true synthetic flag
In a number of cases tools are getting confused over generated aj members that are  "aj-synthetic" but not marked with the synthetic attribute (because in the past, this has upset other tools). The most recent example was a JAXB posting on the list - by having a perthis() clause in an aspect that matched a type with JAXB 2 annotations the user was no longer able to use JAXB. This is a serious issue, and will prevent the usage of JAXB 2 with any type into which we introduce properties as aj-synthetic members. The JAXB 2 solution to ignore such fields is to annotate them with @XmlTransient, but since the field does not exist in the user program they can't even do this!
