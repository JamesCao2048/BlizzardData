NPE or StackOverflow when resolving reference pointcut in ReflectionWorld
Given a type such as :
private static class NamedPointcutResolution {

@Pointcut("execution(* *(..))")
public void a() {}


@Pointcut("this(org.aspectj.weaver.tools.Java15PointcutExpressionTest.A)")
public void b() {}

@Pointcut("a() && b()")
public void c() {}
}
The reflection based delegate is unable to resolve the pointcut c() failing
with either (1) an NPE, or (2) a StackOverflow, depending on the order of the
pointcut definitions in the type.
The problem occurs because in resolving "c()" we get all the pointcuts in the
type, which gets a(), b(), and c(), and tries to resolve them...
