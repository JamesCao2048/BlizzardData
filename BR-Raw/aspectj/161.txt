ajdoc Main class needs refactoring for ease of use
Whilst looking at other ajdoc bugs it was slightly confusing to read the main ajdoc method. I didn't want to include the refactoring of this within patches for the other bugs as this is mearly for ease of use. Therefore, raising this enhancement to cover it.
