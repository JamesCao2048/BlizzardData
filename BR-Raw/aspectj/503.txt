Weaving class loader
Hi!
As discussed on the mailing list a few days ago I implemented a weaving class
loader to enable bytecode based weaving at class loading time. The class loader
is based on the URLClassLoader and can be used like any other URLClassLoader. In
addition to that you can add aspects to the weaving loader. These aspects got
woven into each class that is loaded. The test cases for the class loader aren't
implemented yet, I am still thinking about how to implement them. I will
contribute them later, okay?
