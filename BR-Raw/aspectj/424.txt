Allow aspectPath to contain directories
The -aspectpath option to the compiler only allows jar/zip files, not
directories. But inpath and classpath allow directories.
This capability would improve the handling of aspects spanning multiple projects
in Eclipse. AJDT can currently only support jar/zip files on the aspect path,
which requires one of the projects to create an outjar instead of writing to the
bin directory as usual.
The iajc ant task could then also be enhanced to support aspectpath directories.
