Load time weaver default verbose setting
The default setting for the load time weaver is (as of 1.2.1rc1) to produce
weaving messages rather than ignore them.  I think the default should be changed
to ignore them.
Also, I cannot override the default setting with -Daj.weaver.versose="False".
This is the implied syntax from docs/examples/build.xml.  If this has changed
then build.xml should be updated.  Otherwise, the weaver should be fixed to use it!
