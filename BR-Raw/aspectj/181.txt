[annotations] Incorrect handling of java.lang annotations when matching
As raised by Mr Bodkin on the list:
Can anyone tell me why this compiling this program produces warnings for marker but not for deprecated (in a recent dev build of AJDT)? Is this just a bug? Both have runtime retention, so I would expect equivalent behavior.

@Deprecated @Marker
public aspect Annot {

pointcut test() : within(@Marker *);// *);

declare warning: staticinitialization(@Deprecated *): "deprecated";
declare warning: staticinitialization(@Marker *): "marker";

public static void main(String argz[]) {
new Baz().foo();
}
}

@Deprecated @Marker
class Baz {
public void foo() {}
}

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Marker {

}
