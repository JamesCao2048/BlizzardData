parser cannot parse varargs correctly
the following cannot be parsed:
call(* *(int, Integer...))
see in modules/weaver/.../PointcutVisitorTest (uncomment the testTemp())
See "FIXME AV for Adrian" comments in PatternParser. Half fix but then fails for
other tests.
Adrian can you have a look at it ?
Thanks
