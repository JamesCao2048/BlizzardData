overweaving can attribute duplicate attributes, one of which will not deserialize correctly
When overweaving it is possible that a class will get a second WeaverState attribute.  This second one will not be valid (it hasn't been correctly configured).  This isn't normally a problem because the next thing that happens is that the class is defined to the VM.  But if *another* weave step occurs, the malformed attribute will cause that weave to fail with this kind of message:
bad WeaverState.Kind: -115
The solution is to avoid adding the duplicate when overweaving.
