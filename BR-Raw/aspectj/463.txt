Missing Javadoc comments that aren't missing
Reported in the AJDT newsgroup:
Go to Preferences > Java > Compiler > Javadoc and set "Missing javadoc comments"
to "Warning".
You then get warnings against things you wouldn't expect, such as after advice.
/**
* A comment
*/
public aspect World {
pointcut greeting() : execution(* Hello.sayHello(..));

/**
* A comment
*/
after() returning : greeting() {
System.out.println("world");
}
}
This gives two warnings, one for the aspect itself, and one for the after
returning advice. The warnings occur both with and without the existence of
Javadoc comments!
