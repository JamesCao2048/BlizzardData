Improvements to incremental compilation
This bug is to track compiler improvements to incremental compilation.
There are multiple scenarios to think about but the first focus is changing one
source file for a class/interface that is affected by an Aspect - it should
compile/weave almost instantly.  Recently response times have been reported of
>3seconds (and worse...) and this is not reasonable.
I've put the following improvements in today:
- Caching classpath calculations rather than performing them repeatedly.
- Improved logic to detect weaver completion.
- Removed unnecessary serialization of the structure model.
These are available in dev builds right now:  	ajdt_1.2.0.20050215161840
I'd be interested in user feedback on whether they see noticeable improvements
in their particular projects.
more improvements to follow shortly.
