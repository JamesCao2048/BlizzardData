type construction for signature makes mistakes with wildcards
If you have a type with multiple type params, like this:
Foo<?,T>
the signature is:
LFoo<*TT;>;
and the handling of * is not working in TypeFactory.  If that signature is passed in it will actually build:
Foo<?>
having lost the second type parameter, this breaks code later that has expectations on the number of params.  (e.g. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when building parameterization map)
