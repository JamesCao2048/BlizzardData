Anomalous handling of inter-type declarations to abstract base classes in aspectj 1.1
Version 1.1 of aspectj does not handle correctly inter-type declarations to
abstract base classes.
This appears when the following pattern is present in the code:
Suppose there is an interface InterfaceA, another interface InterfaceB and a
third interface InterfaceC extending InterfaceA and InterfaceB and containing
some method declarations of its own.
Suppose also there is an aspect AConcretisingAspect that contains inter-type
declarations providing default implementations for all InterfaceC's methods
(both own and inherited).
Now suppose we have a class hierarchy emanating from an abstract class
BaseClass, and an aspect BaseClassAspect declaring that BaseClass implements
InterfaceC:
aspect BaseClassAspect {
declare parents: BaseClass implements InterfaceC;
}
Unfortunately, during compilation iajc complains for each offspring of BaseClass
that it does not implement any of the abstract methods of InterfaceA and
InterfaceB (but not of InterfaceC's own!).
This does not happen when BaseClass is not abstract; and it does not occur in
version 1.0.6 of aspectj.
