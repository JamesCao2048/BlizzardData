NPE while building
Building of a large project fails while weaving.
NPE in EclipseSourceContext.removeUnnecessaryProblems(..)
The project was just migrated to Eclipse 3.2
Eclipse newly installed with Eclipse SDK and via Update manager with
AJDT, CDT, Web/J2EE tools, SubClipse, SpringIDE.
Same Project workes in Eclipse 3.1.
Simple Test AspectJ-Project workes OK
Building with Ant/AspectJ compiler (as external Tools Launch in Eclipse)
works.
I tried the following, but got the error anyway:
- Checked out as a new AspectJ Project
- upgraded to the developement Version of AJDT
