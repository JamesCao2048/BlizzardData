spurious "circular dependency" error
AspectJ Compiler 1.1beta4
This program:
aspect Foo {
pointcut p1(): execution(void f()) && cflow(execution(void f1()));
pointcut p2(): execution(void f()) && cflow(execution(void f2()));
before(): p1() { }
after():  p1() { }
before(): p2() { }
after():  p2() { }
}
class A {
void f1() { f(); }
void f2() { f(); }
void f() { }
}
results in these errors:
circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f())
circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f())
circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f())
circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f())
4 errors
If I comment out any one of the four pieces of advice, all the errors go away.
Also, assuming that there is a valid reason for printing this error sometimes, how come there's no line number?
