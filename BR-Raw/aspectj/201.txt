problems with binary weaving declare parents in mixed environment.
These have been reported to me on a large system doing some intricate weaving where some classes are 1.2, some 1.4, some 1.5 and the VM is 1.5.  Binary weaving declare parents sometimes refuses to allow the modification of the hierarchy because it sees a clash between two methods when there is none.  The two cases I'm fixing are:
1. sometimes the signatures of the return types differ with the '.' or '/' problem (fix == be consistent)
2. sometimes the syntheticness of the methods in the relationship isn't determined correctly
