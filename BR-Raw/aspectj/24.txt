Double Synthetic attributes on some around advice members
Some of the support members in aspects were getting Synthetic attributes added twice (once when compiled, once when used as an aspect library).  Some JVMs appear to flag this as a verify error.  The fix is simply to check before adding to make sure the attribute isn't added twice.
