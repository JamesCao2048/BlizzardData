AJDT throws a RuntimeException from EclipseResolvedMember.getAnnotations
Build ID: N/A
Steps To Reproduce:
This exception is happening for us in both Eclipse 3.4 and 3.3 when we run an incremental build on one of our projects.
We are using an aspect to declare an annotation on a class in the project, and we only started seeing this exception after we added it.
A clean build on the project never throws the exception, only an incremental build.

Compile error: RuntimeException thrown: not yet implemented - please raise an AJ bug
I was going to include the AJDT Event log for the build but it is very long, and mostly unremarkable,
so I have included only the section for the project where the exception was thrown.

This is occurring frequently, but not every time so we haven't been able to narrow down a reasonable sized test case.
