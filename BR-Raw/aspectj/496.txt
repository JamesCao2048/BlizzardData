Race condition in test suite for incremental
On faster machines (my linux desktop, andy's home pc) several of the tests in
ajcTests.xml are failing (suite attached). This appears to be due to a race
condition between checking directory contents and waiting for the compilation to
complete. I have an environment in which I can test candidate fixes if you can
give me a pointer for what to tweak...
