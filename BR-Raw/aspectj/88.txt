Support Load-Time Weaving and HotSwap
LTW can be used in a development environment when the JVM is run under the debugger. If a class is modified it may be recompiled, submitted to the JVM being debugged and "HotSwapped" (see  bug 117854 ). The AspectJ 5 javaagent used for LTW is made aware of this through the JVMTI ( http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/ClassFileTransformer.html ) but current implementation throws an exception. There may be a limited number of transformations we could safely perfrom especially if the aspects involved only implement dynamic cross-cutting.
