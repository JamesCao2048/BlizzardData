[handles] Remove trailing '/' from source path handles
In  bug 262953 , we noticed that when the .classpath has an entry like:
<classpathentry kind="src" path="src/"/>
Instead of something like:
<classpathentry kind="src" path="src"/>
AspectJ handles will include the extra '/', but JDT handles will not.  On the AJDT side, I fixed things in  Bug 262953  so that this kind of classpath entry will not be created by AJDT.  However, for consistency, it is probably a good idea for AspectJ to handle these kinds of paths the same as JDT.
For example, the AspectJ handle for the source folder in Spacewar when the .classpath entry contains and extra '/' looks like:
=Spacewar Example/src/
but the JDT handle looks like:
=Spacewar Example/src
