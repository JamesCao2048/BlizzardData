Incremental compilation does not delete weaver-generated class files
During incremental compilation, AjState records classes generated from source
files following the initial compile phase, but before weaving. (So that these
can be passed to the weaver on a subsequent iteration if we need to reweave the
world). During weaving of a given class file, the weaver may generate additional
class files (for e.g. around closures) that get written to the output. If the
orginal source file is deleted, these additional weaver generated classes are
not deleted from the output since AjState does not know about them.
