Front-end bug, shouldn't allow patterns of the form foo.., should be foo..*
See following code:
public class Test2 {
public static void main(String args[])
{ System.out.println("Hi");
}
}
aspect Aspect2 {
// shouldn't one have to say,  java..* instead of java.. in the following??
// Note that the first advice (incorrect one) passes the front-end, but does
// not match,  whereas the second one does match.   I believe the front-end
// should reject the first one.
before () : call( * java..(..)) && within(Test2)
{ System.out.println(
"Incorrect One: Before a call of method in a java package ");
}
before () : call( * java..*(..)) && within(Test2)
{ System.out.println(
"Correct One: Before a call of method in a java package ");
}
}
