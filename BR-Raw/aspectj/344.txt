varargs doesn't work for ITD'd constructors
The following program doesn't compile:
class MyClass {
public static void main(String []argv) {
new MyClass(new Object[]{"a","b","c"});
new MyClass("a","b","c");
}
}
aspect A {
public MyClass.new(Object... names) {
System.out.println(names[0]);
}
}
(this is similar to  bug 110906 )
