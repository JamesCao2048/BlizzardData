ajc changes classfile timestamps even if compilation fails (regression)
It appears that ajc 1.2 updates a classfile timestamps even if the compilation
fails. This breaks the integration with the Ant build system. E.g. using the
ant "javac" task with the Ajc11CompilerAdapter interface, the compilation may
fail on the first attempt and succeed on the second attempt, - because ajc has
touched the timestamp and Ant hence decides that nothing needs to be recompiled.
This did not happen in ajc 1.1.
To reproduce:
1. In the examples/observer folder, run a build:
ajc -sourceroots .
2. Edit the "Demo.java" class and insert the line "DONT COMPILE"
3. Run the compilation again. The compiler displays the correct error message
but the Demo.class file has been updated with the compile-time timestamp.
