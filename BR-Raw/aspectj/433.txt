Visibility selector ignored for pointcuts
Using ajdoc under AJDT 1.1.12 or AspectJ 1.2.1 at the commandline has the
following aspect has problems.
public abstract aspect Aspect {
private pointcut privatePointcut ();
protected pointcut protectedPointcut ();
public pointcut publicPointcut ();

private void privateMethod () {

}

public void protectedMethod () {

}

public void publicMethod () {

}
}
1. Asking for "protected" gives all pointcuts (public, protected _and_ private)
2. The Aspect entry is wrong: "public abstract class Aspect"
3. The "Methods inherited ..." section has a leading comma: ", clone, equals,
finalize, ..."
