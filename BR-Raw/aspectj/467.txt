Bad injar aspect name on Linux
If you checkout the "JarUsingProject" project from "org.eclipse.ajdt.test/manual
testing" in the AJDT 1.1.12 tree, and look at the advised-by entries in the
outline view and the context menu of the gutter annotation, on Windows you get
"injar aspect: AbstractAspect.aj", but on Linux you get "injar aspect:
C:eclipse30AJDTPluginTesteclipseworkspaceJarGeneratingProjectsrcp1AbstractAspect.aj".
The Windows-style path indicates the location of the original class files in the
JAR file, which was clearly built on Windows.
