#NAME?
ajc doesn't recognize Windows absolute file paths that don't start with a drive
letter, e.g., run:
ajc -inpath test.jar
[error] build config error: bad inpath component: test.jar
but
ajc -inpath c:test.jar
works
ajc -aspectpath test.jar Test.aj
[error] build config error: bad aspectpath: test.jar
ajc -aspectpath c:test.jar Test.aj
(works)
