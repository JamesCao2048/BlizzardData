ajc option to change -Xlint level per-message without Xlintfile
The -Xlintfile option is not a great fit for controlling message across multiple build projects, specifically in my case from the pluginManagement section of a maven parent pom. The problem is that you need a local file to configure the per-message output levels (ignore/warning/error) when you really want to specify it in the build script or in a shared file.
As an alternative to -Xlintfile, it would be handy to be able to change an Xlint warning level per message using command line options.
For example:
ajc -Xlint:adviceDidNotMatch=ignore
would override the XlintDefault.properties file for the adviceDidNotMatch message.
