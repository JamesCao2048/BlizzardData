ajdoc should not use the Declaration and SymbolManager classes
In order to speed up porting porting to the old HTML generation code ajdoc
continues to use the following classes:
org.aspectj.tools.ajdoc.Declaration
org.aspectj.tools.ajdoc.SymbolManager
These funtion only as a wrapper to the ASM, and are not needed.  The next
refactoring effort should get rid of them (and all those static methods as
well!).
