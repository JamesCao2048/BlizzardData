IllegalStateException for non-generic type
I believe this is similar to 112880.  The message and stack trace I am getting are
-- (IllegalStateException) Can't ask to parameterize a member of non-generic type: com...object  kind(raw)
Can't ask to parameterize a member of non-generic type: com...object  kind(raw)
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't ask to parameterize a member of non-generic type: com....object  kind(raw)

The same code was able to be weaved under 1.5.0.  The reason why this is a major issue is 1.5.0 suffers from a StackOverflowException.
