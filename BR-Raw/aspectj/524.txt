out of memory error when compiling
Getting an out of memory error when compiling with Ajc 1.1 RC1.
I know this is not very descriptive, but maybe you can point me into a
direction of getting more output.
here some additional information though:
Code base is medium size (about 1500 classfiles)
I removed all my aspects and still receive the error.
Running it from the command line: ajc -classpath whateveritis -sourceroots
whateveritis -d whateveritis
