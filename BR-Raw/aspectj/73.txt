import handling and type lookup issues
Raised by Peter Melnikov on the mailing list.
Two problems:
1) the binding scope being used for annotation style aspects accumulates lots of duplicate import prefixes in the SimpleScope object.
2) SimpleScope.lookupType tries the prefixes even if the type is already fully qualified.
The combination of these issues causes a terrible mess.  Lots of class lookup failures.  Since the type cannot be 'partially qualified' it is silly to use the prefixes if the type is fully qualified.
