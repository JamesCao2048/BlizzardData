Missing relationship for declare @method when annotating a co-located method
For this program (when all entered into *one* file) I don't see a marker from the declare to the annotated method.  If the annotated method is in another file, I do... (not sure if fields/ctors/types are also a problem..)
public aspect basic {
declare @method:
* debit(..):
@Secured(role="supervisor");
}
class BankAccount {
public void debit(long accId,long amount) {
}
}
@interface Secured {
String role();
}
