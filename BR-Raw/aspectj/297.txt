Not Allowing Access to Private ITD inside Nested Type
AspectJ is failing to allow access to a private ITD field from a type nested inside the aspect, which is inconsistent with Java's access rules.
Here is the source. See also the follow up patch to tests that integrates it into the ajc150 test suite.
public aspect prUnknown {
private static interface Marker {}
private class Foo implements Marker {
public Foo() {
bar = null; // allowed
listener = null; // should also be allowed
this.listener = null; // so should this
Marker.this.listener = null; // and this
((Marker)this).listener = null; // and this
}
}
private Object Marker.listener;
private Object bar;
}
