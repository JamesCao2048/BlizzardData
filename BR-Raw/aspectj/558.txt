allow use of an environment variable to set compiler arguments
I'm trying to create a special jsp compilation servlet in Tomcat 4.x that uses
the aspectj compiler. I can plug in the compiler adapter, but I don't have
control of the ant code they use to invoke the compiler, so I'd like to use
an environment variable to do this (apparently the only mechanism they do
support).
I'm doing this so I can pass an aspectpath in to weave aspects into the
compiled jsp servlet.
