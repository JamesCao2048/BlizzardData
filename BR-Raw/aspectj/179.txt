Allow multiple levels of LTW information
It would be nice if basic information about load-time weaving (what version of AspectJ is being used, what loaders are doing weaving and what configuration is being used) was available without all of the -verbose information listing of all classes woven or not woven.
It's also unfortunate that the flags for weaving level are 2 quite different ones:
-Daj.weaving.verbose -Dorg.aspectj.weaver.showWeaveInfo
Why not something like -Dorg.aspectj.weaver.level=[none|summary|info|verbose]
summary: just what configuration is used
info: list affected join points etc. (like showWeaveInfo)
verbose: all (like verbose now)
