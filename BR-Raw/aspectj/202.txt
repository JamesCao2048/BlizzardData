Can't call synthetic aspectOf method on aspect in library jar
Separate compilation of the following program breaks on 1.5.2rc1 because of the recent change to marking aspect methods as synthetic:
public aspect Asp {
}
public class Client {
public static void main(String argz[]) {
System.out.println("Can call aspectOf? "+Asp.aspectOf());
}
}
C:develscratchsynthetic>ajc -classpath asp.jar;%CLASSPATH% Client.java
C:develscratchsyntheticClient.java:3 [error] The method aspectOf() is undefi
ned for the type Asp
System.out.println("Can call aspectOf? "+Asp.aspectOf());
1 error
C:develscratchsynthetic>javac -classpath asp.jar;%CLASSPATH% Client.java
Client.java:3: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method aspectOf()
location: class Asp
System.out.println("Can call aspectOf? "+Asp.aspectOf());
^
1 error
Clearly it's vital that external users of a library be able to call API methods like aspectOf on library aspects.
This works:
C:develscratchsynthetic>ajc *.aj Client.java
C:develscratchsynthetic>java Client
