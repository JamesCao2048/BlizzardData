fail in compiling aspect with overriding method introduction with different throws clause
A first class (class A) declares only one method with some exceptions in the
throws clause ( void m() throws Exception ).
A second class (class B) extends it without redefinig the method.
An aspect declares a method introduction in the class B, with the same name,
signature and return type of the one in class A, but without throws clause; this
is a legal override.
In the second class (class B) each invocation to the overriden method doesn't
need a try-catch block, because it refers to his hown method that raises no
exception.
