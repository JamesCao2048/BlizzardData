LTW weaver produces a debug message at the begining
Using the code in  bug #148381  (with any of the working options), LT weaver
produces what seems a debug message:
"? WeavingClassFileProvider.acceptResult() test.Main->test.Main$AjcClosure1"
> java -javaagent:%ASPECTJ_LIB_HOME%aspectjweaver.jar test.Main
? WeavingClassFileProvider.acceptResult() test.Main->test.Main$AjcClosure1
Method Main.foo() took longer than expected
Max expected = 1000, actual = 65371
