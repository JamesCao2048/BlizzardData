[itds] abstract synchronized: compile error expected
when using intertype declaration, the compiler doesn't check for illegal
modifier combinations such as "abstract synchronized".
another manifestation of this problem is when using intertype declaration to add
a synchronized method to an interface. the problem is more severe in this case
because conceptually, this method is not abstract at all.
interface Interface {}
abstract class Parent {}
class Child extends Parent implements Interface {}
aspect Bug {
// illegal modifier combination not caught by ajc
public abstract synchronized void Parent._abstract();
public synchronized void Child._abstract() {}
// the following has the same effect, but is easier to miss
public /* implicit abstract */ synchronized void Interface._interface() {}
// use Child to make java complain: "illegal modifiers: 0x421"
// (this corresponds to "public abstract synchronized")
public static void main(String[] args) {
new Child();
}
}
