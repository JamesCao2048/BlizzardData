performance improvements for runtime library
I am heavily using the runtime signature information from
thisJoinPoint.getSignature() and the toString() method of it. This causes heavy
String operations each time the toString method is called. Would it be possible
to cache the resulting string for example in MethodSignatureImpl and similar
classes for other signatures?
