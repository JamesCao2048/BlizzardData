retitle warning to "circular {advice} dependency at ...
When writing aspects with cycles in the advice precedence, get warning "circular
dependency at {join point}" -- should be "circular advice dependency..." or
"circular advice precedences at {join point} -- reorder the advice in the aspect".
FWIW, here's an example of circularity in advice precedence:
----
aspect A {
pointcut crun() : execution (void run()) ;
before() : crun() {}
after() returning : crun() {}
void around() : crun() { proceed(); }
}
----
See programming guide for more discussion of circularity in advice precedence.
