".lst" file parsing errors should include sourceline information
To check for this bug add an erroneous line to an ".lst" file and compile it
with AJDE.  The error message returned is project-specific.  It should be
specific to the ".lst" file in which the error originated (i.e. the message
needs a SourceLocation).
