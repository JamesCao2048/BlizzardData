AspectJ 5 M2 should implement backwards compatibility for binary aspect form
Hi Adrian,
thanks for the detailed explanation of the compatibility questions. That
explains the problem I observed.

Interesting point. Which one? The one that is used to compile it or the
one that is used to weave it?

Okay. Is there a bug to track this? I really would like to update the
weaver of my weaving runtime but only if it allows to load/weave
asepects that are compiled with any of the AJDT versions that are out
right now (AJDT 1.1.x and AJDT 1.2.0Mx).
