Need to demote "warning ignoring duplicate definition" from warning to debug
Build Identifier: 1.6.11
This kind of 鈥減roblem鈥 can occur for complex class loader hierarchies, and since it is not really a problem, we should make it debug level message so as not to write log messages un-necessarily.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an application that has some weaved class loaders hierarchy - recommend some URLClassLoader derived ones
2. Add the same(!) JAR with only an aop.xml file to more than one loader along the hierarchy
3. Make the loader the default context thread loader and start running some code.
