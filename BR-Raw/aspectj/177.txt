[ltw] can get into a state with the Version static initializer
The static initializer in Version that parses the time_text string and turns it into a long field seems to sometimes get loadtime weaving into a state - touching DateFormatters early on is always a pain, so I'm moving it to be processed on first reference.  I could take it a step further ... if WeaverStateInfo didn't write out the time (it doesnt read it back in!!) it would never be used at all in normal processing - potentially saving us from loading a bunch of underpinning junk to do the formatting...
