AJDoc launch script on Windows can lose arguments
Using AspectJ 1.2rc1 on Windows XP
This report highlights a problem that I've seen using ajdoc.bat on Windows but
the issue applies equally to the ajc.bat and ajbrowser.bat files as well.
The %ASPECTJ_HOME%binajdoc.bat file that users run to launch the ajdoc tool
imposes a limit of only 9 command line arguments that may be passed to the
class org.aspectj.tools.ajdoc.Main. In scenarios where there the -sourcepath,
-classpath, -d etc options are used it is easy for these to "eat up" the list
of arguments that are passed into the JVM. A long list of packages entered
at the end of the ajdoc.bat command can be truncated or possibly even ignored
(in which case an error message will be output telling the user that no
classes or packages have been specified).
In order to prevent a limit being put on the number of arguments passed to
the launched JVM, the invocation line needs to end with %* rather than the
%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 list it currently uses.
The proposed fix also *seems* (could somebody else confirm this ?) to sort
out another problem regarding the ajdoc.bat file which is this : long semi-
colon delimited paths supplied as the arguments for the -sourcepath and
-classpath options seem to get split apart and passed into the JVM as separate
arguments unless the entire path list is supplied inside quotes. This should
not be necessary. It seems that the batch file processor interprets the
semi-colons in a path list as delimiters between arguments. Consequently
each element in the path list is treated as a separate argument instead
of being part of one big string representing the sourcepath or classpath.
