Support for simple dump file
When the compiler terminates abnormally (exception) or behaves unexpectedly
(warning/error/abort) a simple dump of the compiler state should be produced
to aid problem diagnosis. The content and conditions under which the dump is
produced should be configurable by the user but the facility should be enabled
by default for exceptions. Consequently its inclusion should have negligible
impact on compiler performance and footprint. The file should be attached to
bug reports to give a complete and objective description of the user鈥檚
environment and support problem resolution where a testcase cannot be provided.
One approach is to write a uniquely name file (using date & time) in the
current directory e.g 鈥渁jcore.20040818.105200.txt鈥 which should be human
readable (it can be zipped if large) to allow the user to potentially diagnose
their own problems or remove potentially sensitive data before submission. It
should contain basic information such as AspectJ version, system properties
and command line as well as failure information such as _full_ exception stack
trace, compiler messages and internal compiler state.
