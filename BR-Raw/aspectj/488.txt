Hiding of Instance Methods by static methods
Using Introduction it is possible to hide instance methods by static methods.
Example:
class Super {
public void m(){};
}
class Sub {}
aspect A {
public static void Sub.m(){}
}
Acccording to the Java Language Specification this is not allowed. Is this
behaviour desired ??
It is also possible to override static methods by instance methods, wich causes
a compile time error in java.
