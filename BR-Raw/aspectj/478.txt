.lst file entries not resolved relative to list file: {boot}classpath, extdirs,
My -classpath entry in a config/.lst file was resolved relative to the working
directory rather than to the config/.lst file.  BuildArgParser.java looks like
this would also be true for bootclasspath and extdirs, but not for injars,
aspectpath, or sourceroots.
