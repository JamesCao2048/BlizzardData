Changes to Main.java
In order to get the AJDT ant integration working, we need a small change to Main.java.
We need to be able to pass in a custom org.aspectj.bridge.ICommand object.  Currently, the ICommand object is created via reflection.
Here is my suggestion:
1. augment the ICommand local variable to being a field
2. add a setter for this field
3. change this:
ICommand command = ReflectionFactory.makeCommand(commandName, holder);
to this:
if (command != null)
command = ReflectionFactory.makeCommand(commandName, holder);
