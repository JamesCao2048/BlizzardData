AspectJ does not correctly support -cp
Discovered by Andy Brodie.
-cp is a shorthand for -classpath supported by the JDT compiler.  AspectJ does
not correctly support -cp option.  Look at this example:
C:aspectj1.2>ajc -inpath injar.jar -outjar outjar.jar -cp libaspectjrt.jar
[error] can't find type org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint
1 error
C:aspectj1.2>ajc -inpath injar.jar -outjar outjar.jar -classpath libaspectjrt.jar
This is due to the arg parser in AspectJ only recognizing -classpath.  It
doesn't fail when it encounters -cp, it just ignores it and passes it down to
JDT for processing.  The fix is to recognize -cp too.
