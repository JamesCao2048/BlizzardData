Inconsistent Implementations of ReferenceType.getDeclaredMethods()
I am running into a problem in load-time weaving when I use reflection delegates because the weaver is generating an incorrect bridge method when I perform an inter-type declaration on Struts.ActionServlet for the init method. On investigation, the BCEL world is recognizing this as an overriding method, because its version of getDeclaredMethods is returning the declared methods for all ancestor superclasses. However, the reflection world is returning only the declared methods for this one class. It therefore appears that the weaver expects getDeclaredMethods to return all of them (making the name quite misleading). I think previously the method was being implemented inconsistently between 1.5 reflection and <1.5 reflection delegates. But it looks like it needs to be handled consistently to include all superclass methods.
However, I don鈥檛 know what other places (e.g., the MAP) are really expecting getDeclaredMethods and its siblings to behave like Java reflection's version鈥
I started work on adding a getAllDeclaredMethods method to ReferenceType and delegates, as an alternative to provide the weaver the ability to check method overriding as in this case, but it's a little bit involved and I wanted to flag the issue first.
Here's a test that fails and illustrates the issue:
