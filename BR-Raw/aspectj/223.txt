Compiler issues message concerning aop.xml even when not doing LTW
From the mailing list:
=============
I am executing the command as below,

COMMAND: ajc -inpath woven_hello1.jar -aspectpath aspect2.jar -outjar woven_hello2.jar

I am getting same old error,
woven_hello1.jar [error] aspect 'aspect1' woven into 'Hello' must be declared in an aop.xml file.
(no source information available)
I have placed both aspect1.class and aspect2.class in CLASSPATH system variable.
==============
We shouldn't be putting out messages about aop.xml when we are not doing LTW - this message points the user to a solution that will not work in this case!
