LTW doesn't work using JRE1.4 in Eclipse
LTW doesn't work using JRE1.4 in Eclipse
now I want to support JRE1.4 when LTW.
I defined a aop.xml file in application META-INF path, it works fine using JRE1.4 in command-line, aop.xml file is used when LTW, the command as below:
"D:workBTMeclipse 3.1.1eclipse-SDK-3.1.1-win32eclipse-1.4.2jrebinjava" -classpath "C:aspectj1.5libaspectjweaver.jar" "-Djava.system.class.loader=org.aspectj.weaver.loadtime.WeavingURLClassLoader" "-Daj.class.path=D:workBTMeclipse 3.1.1jre1.4.2myTest;C:aspectj1.5docexamplesarmtestjarbtm-deps-e3.1.jar;C:aspectj1.5docexamplesarmtestjarbtm-rt.jar" Hello
but it doesn't work in Eclipse, I added upper command to VM arguments, it can't find aop.xml, because if I changed aop.xml to be wrong, there is no any error when execute the application in Eclipse , but there will be error when execute it in command-line, based on this point, I think that aop.xml didn't be used in Eclipse, I also tried to add "-Daj.aspect.path=D:workBTMeclipse 3.1.1jre1.4.2myTest", but it is still. so I want to confirm if AspectJ only supports command-line for JRE1.4? doesn't support Eclipse for JRE1.4?
BTW, my Eclipse env: eclipse 3.1.1 + ajdt_1.3_for_eclipse_3.1 + Sun JDK 1.4.2.
I also tried to use eclipse 3.1.2, but this problem is still existed.
