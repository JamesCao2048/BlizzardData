Version the BCEL libraries to allow graceful failure when the wrong version is found.
We have bugs reported like  bug 59921  and  bug 60389 .  These bugs relate to the
problem where the compiler locates the wrong version of BCEL libraries -
because they are a different version, some of the methods AspectJ calls either
don't exist or have different parameter lists.  The error the user sees is a
horrible internal compiler error.  if we versioned the BCEL libraries as we
changed them, we could check the version found on compiler startup and verify
they are as expected.  if the version doesn't match we can report a nice
readable error message that tells the user how to fix it.
