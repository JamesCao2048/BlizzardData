Generics problem with Set - does not compile with AspectJ 5
I tried different things to remove compiler warnings about generics which you
get when you switch to JDK 5 and use collections. At last I fall back to JDK
1.4. The following code compiles with AspectJ 5 and JDK compliance level 1.4:
public aspect SubjectAspect {

private Set Subject.observers = new HashSet();
public void Subject.addObserver(SubjectObserver observer) {
observers.add(observer);
}
...
}
After switching to compliance level 5.0 I get an error message
"The method add(E) in the type Set<E> is not applicable for the arguments
(SubjectObserver)".
I don't know if it is a similar problem like #87550 but I means for older
projects which use collections that they can't switch to JDK 1.5
