Weaving into jar fails if some of the referred classes are unavailable
I am trying to profile JDBC access in a Spring-based application.
Since all the JDBC interaction is performed through Spring classes,
I need to weave into spring.jar. However, many of the classes
referred by spring.jar aren't available to me (I am not using
the functionality implemented by many of the classes). When I
try to weave into spring.jar I get errors complaining that it
can't find types for those classes.
I expected that ajc would ignore unknown classes unless weaving
would be affected by content/API of those classes.
Using jar files that refer to foreign classes that one may
never have/need is a common scenario. For example, spring.jar
refers to Velocity, Struts, JDO, Hibernate, Quartz classes;
I am unlikely to use all of these referred frameworks in an
application. This bug/limitation prevents using AspectJ with
such jars.
To reproduce the bug in a controlled environment, I created
the following aspect which should make the weaving process
a pass-thru filter (no join point is matched by the pointcut)
class TemporaryClass {
}
public aspect NoWeaveAspect {
before() : call(* TemporaryClass.*(..)) && within(org.spring..*) {
}
}
Weaving this aspect with spring.jar should result in logically
identical jar file. However, when I compile using the following
command (or equivalent ant task), I get the following errors:
