Unexpected Xlint:unresolvableMember warning with withincode
The following code produces an Xlint:unresolvableMember warning:
class A {
A(Class type) {}
A() {
this(String.class);
}
}
class B {
public void test() {
}
public void test2() {
test();
}
}
aspect C {
void around() :
(call (void B.test()) &&
withincode (void B.test2())) {
proceed();
}
}
The warning text is:
Warning.java:22 can not resolve this member:
void A.<catch>(java.lang.ClassNotFoundException) [Xlint:unresolvableMember]
Line 22 is the line in the aspect that says "withincode".  If I comment out
the aspect, the warning goes away.  Also, if I comment out A's default
constructor, it goes away.  The "String.class" seems to have something to do
with the warning.
I can reproduce this with 1.1rc1 and 1.1rc2.
