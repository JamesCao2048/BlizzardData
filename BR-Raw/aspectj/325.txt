[itds] Problem with an ITD on an interface
If an ITD method is declared on an interface with an anonymous inner class
returned as the result, the compiler generates an error for any "super.xxx"
calls in the anonymous inner class.  The example project shows this with a
nested inner interface, but the same problem occurs with an ITD of this kind
on any interface.  The error does not occur if the ITD is declared on an inner
class (as shown in the example) or a normal class.
