SerialVersionUID handling
from emails - needs a decision
---------------
Hi Andy
is there a way for the weaver to add to weaved classes the serial ver
uid field based on the pre-weaved bytecode computation.
Right now it issues lint warning when a Serializable class without
serial ver uid is encountered and due to evil #75442 this is very
annoying for LTW.
A first step would be to at least deal with that when we had the
perObbjectTypeMunger (then should not change any kind previous stuff).

Andy,
Generating the suid sounds like a nice idea but the code the JVM used is
private inside ObjectStreamClass. Also we need to take care with ITD fields
to ensure correct behaviour when sending and receiving from non-woven
classes. Basically the programmer needs to be engaged, it only affects
serializable classes and in 1.5 there is a warning if you don't declare the
field so there is a strong hint to the programmer to solve the problem. For
LTW we should make an enhancement to allow the user to configure Lint and
other things. For example they may or may not be interested in advice not
matching.

Alex,
We should make a distinction between benign changes to suid and those that
affect members. Generating suid when we add a static initializer (to
support thisJoinPoint or the staticinitialization join point), accessor
methods for privileged aspects or transient per-fields is OK. Doing for
ITDs is more problematic.
