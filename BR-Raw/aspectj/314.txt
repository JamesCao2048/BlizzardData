PointcutParser is not configurable
I'm testing the reflection and weaver tools APIs. When I using following code:
PointcutParser parse = new PointcutParser();
String expr = "call(public * main.hello(..)";
PointcutExpression pex = parse.parsePointcutExpression(expr);
Whenever I use a full qualified class name in pointcut expression, an
exception is throwed out:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: warning no match for this type name: obj
[Xlint:invalidAbsoluteTypeName]
I try to turn off this Lint exception. But it seems I must access to world
field of PointcutParser. This is inconvenient because world field is not
exposed by PointcutParser.
The existing PointcutParser interface implicitly creates a World and does not
allow any configuration including classpath or lint. But developers may need
this kind of control.
