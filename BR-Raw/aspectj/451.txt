Avoid clashes in the org.eclipse namespace by renaming our duplicates.
We have recently renamed our 'copy' of BCEL to use a different package prefix so
that our version never clashes with another version that might be around on a
users system.
This enhancement is to do the same thing for our 'copy' of the org.eclipse.jdt
code (in the shadows project).  As part of packaging the shadows project to
create the 'jdtcore' jar files (bin and src) we will rename the packages from:
org.eclipse.jdt.***
to
org.aspectj.org.eclipse.jdt.**
This has a really nice side effect that we can make our version of the compiler
accessible in the IDE.  It should now be possible for AJDT to work more closely
with it and get features like eager parsing to work.
Care will be taken that we don't accidentally make the merge process a nightmare.
