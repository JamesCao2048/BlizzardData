Advice calling protected super method causing java.lang.VerifyError 'Bad access to protected data'
A java.lang.VerifyError is thrown at runtime complaining about 'Bad access to
protected data' when advice, on a sub-aspect, that calls a protected method, on
the super-aspect, is woven into a class.
However another call to the same method woven into the same class but due to
advice declared in the super-aspect works fine.

The aspects were woven into precompiled (by sun's 1.4 javac) classes.
The verify error occurs under both sun's 1.4 and blackdowns 1.3 VMs, and presumably
all VMs.

Workaround:
Making the protected method public fixes the verify error.

A test case is available in CVS:
