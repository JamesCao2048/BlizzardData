declare precedence on a class should be a compile-time error
The compiler silently accepts
----
public class DeclarePrecedence {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("hello");
}
}
aspect DP {
declare precedence: DeclarePrecedence, DP;
before() : staticinitialization(DeclarePrecedence) {
System.out.println("ok");
}
}
----
Since this is likely to be a mistake, an error would be nice.  However, that
would mean saying (!TargetClass && TargetClass+) to pick out the aspect subtypes
of TargetClass.
