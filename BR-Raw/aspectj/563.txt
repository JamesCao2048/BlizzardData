ajc needs -d . option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage
I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac.
I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying
Eclipse compiler.
Create a class in a subpackage such as:
package subpackage;
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello");
}
}
Then compile using following command:
> ajc subpackageTest.java
You will see a directory "subpackage" created under the existing "subpackage"
directory. The test.class is then put in subpackagesubpackage directory.
This means running java command results in
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test
Running either of the following command fixes the problem:
> ajc -d . subpackageTest.java
or
> javac subpackageTest.java
No big deal, really. But it will be nice to have same behavior as javac.
