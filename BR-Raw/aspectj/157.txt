[ltw] Unnecessary exceptions during concretization of aspects in aop.xml
Due to the mechanism used in ConcreteAspectCodeGen I see a lot of unnecessary exceptions created.  The problem is rather than looking up a type to confirm it doesn't exist before defining it, the code uses a resolve() to check if it exists and resolve attempts to build it if it isnt there.  Because the classloader will never find an aop.xml defined type (the class doesn't exist anywhere on the classpath), a spurious exception is created and sometimes traced (if collecting a trace).  I'm going to change the code to do a lookup, that is all that is really necessary.
