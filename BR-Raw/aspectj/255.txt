Incorrect error on "declare" statements
The error associated with the declare construct is incorrect.
The current message is:
"expected one of error, warning, parents, soft, dominates"
dominates should be changed to "precendence" and new annotation related declararions should be mentioned. Here is a suggestion:
"expected one of error, warning, parents, soft, precedence, @type, @method, @constructor, @field"
