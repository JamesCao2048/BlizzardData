[ataspectj] @AspectJ style inter-type declaration causes false compiler error during incremental build
Build ID: M20070212-1330
Steps To Reproduce:
Use @DeclareParents to introduce a default interface implementation to an existing type.
A full build compiles cleanly and works as expected.  An incremental build causes the following type of compile error: "The type FooImpl must implement the inherited abstract method Test.methodA()".
In this example FooImpl is the class we are introducing a default implementation of the Test interface which defines the method "methodA".
