[handles] Cross reference view and markers mix up joinpoints assigned to advice
Build ID: M20090211-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
I have two pieces of after advice in my aspect.
In the cross reference view I see all of the joinpoints for both after advice selecting one of the after advice statements.  When I select the other after advice statement I see no joinpoints.
When I select the marker for either piece of after advice, I see all the joinpoints for both pieces of advice.
1. open and perform a clean compile on the attached project
2. open the xref view
3. select line 22 an note that you see 5 joinpoints (should only be 3)
4. select line 68 and note that you see zero joinpoints (should be 2 here)
5. right click the marker at line 68 and choose "advises" - note you see all 5 joinpoints
6. right click the marker at line 22 and choose "advises" - note you see all 5 joinpoints
