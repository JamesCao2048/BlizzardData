aspectjrt.jar manifest file name needs changing to upper case
The name of the aspectjrt.jar's manifest file should be changed from
META-INF/manifest.mf
to
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
According to the Jar file specification (see  http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1 .
2/docs/guide/jar/manifest.html) the name of the manifest file needs to be all
upper case. It's beyond trivial, I know, but it does cause an unnecessary
warning in at least one popular IDE for J2EE development (IBM WebSphere Studio)
when the aspectjrt.jar is packaged in an EAR file.
If there was an option to assign this a "very, very trivial" severity level I
would.
