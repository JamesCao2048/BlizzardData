Fully qualified ITD has incorrect handle identifier
In the following aspect:
public aspect Aspect {
public void q2.ThisClass.something2() {}
}
In aspectJ, the ITD has the following handle identifier (notice that the ITD name is not fully qualified):
=AspectJ Project/src2<p*Aspect.aj'Aspect)ThisClass.something2
However, it should be (with fully qualified name):
=AspectJ Project/src2<p*Aspect.aj'Aspect)q2.ThisClass.something2
This means that fully qualified ITDs cannot be navigated to or searched.  I'm a little surprised that this doesn't work because I thought I had tests for it...
