SoftException.printStackTrace(..) should print wrapped throwable too
SoftExceptions should print not only their trace but also that of the wrapped
throwable.
We should be able to set a flag on class initialization whether we are running
under 1.4 and then implement it under 1.4 using initCause() and otherwise by
direct delegation.  I can do this fix if we're agreed.
