configure a set of classloader for which weavers should not be created in an LTW scenario
Prototyped and tested for JspClassLoaders (see the thread 'aspectj and jsp load' on the mailing list).
That was done through a system property but it would be easier via aop.xml.  However, this would be the first time we have an aop.xml setting that affects global operation of loadtime weaving.  When any classloader actually got far enough to load the aop.xmls it would discover this setting and from that point on it would be set.  In our JspClassLoader case this would mean that either some non-JspClassLoader is run early enough to discover this setting and turn it off for all JspClassLoaders or the first JspClassLoader will discover the setting and turn it off for all other JspClassLoaders.  I think we can live with that mode of operation.
