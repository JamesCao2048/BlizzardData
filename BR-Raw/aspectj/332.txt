-XhasMember is not processed correctly when passed from AJDT
To test this in AJDT install the bean example, add a new interface called I
and then add the following line to BoundPoint.aj:
declare parents: hasmethod(* set*(..)) implements I;
Now open the AspectJ Compiler preference page and select "Has Member" on the
advanced tab.  Click OK, rebuild and if the option was working the project
would build correctly.  As it stands there is an error:
the type pattern hasmethod(* set*(..)) can only be used when the -XhasMember
option is set
