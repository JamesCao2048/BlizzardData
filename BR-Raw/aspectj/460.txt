AJDoc: should be able to set encoding like javadoc
ajdoc doesn't support the -encoding -docencoding and -charset options of javadoc.
Especially, it doesn't pass on the -encoding to ajc.
If your project uses a source file encoding (e.g. UTF-8)
differing form the platform standard, and some java identifiers
use characters byond the standard ASCII range, you won't be able
to use ajdoc at all.
