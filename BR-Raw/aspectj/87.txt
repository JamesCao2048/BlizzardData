Unclosed stream in AjAttribute
Created  attachment 153879   [details]
Patch to close the stream at the end of the method.
The getAllBytes() method of org.aspectj.weaver.AjAttribute uses a
DataOutputStream to write into a ByteArrayOutputStream. However, the stream is
neither closed nor flushed at the end of the method, so that its not sure that
all bytes are actually written (it depends on the implemention of
DataOutputStream).
To fix it, one should add a call to close() or flush(). A patch is attached.
