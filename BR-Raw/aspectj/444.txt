unnecessary cast causing problems
class: org.aspectj.weaver.ResolvedTypeX$Name
method: isCoerceableFrom(..)
I am having trouble with the line:
ResolvedMember[] b = ((Name)other).getDeclaredMethods(); //??? is this cast
always safe
As the comment suggests this cast is NOT always safe. In my case the cast is not
safe because I have some additional implementations for ResolvedTypeX (some
optimizations).
Solution: just remove the cast since the method "getDeclaredMethods" is already
defined abstract in the type of "other" (ResolvedTypeX). So the cast seems to be
obsolete anyway.
