Java 1.5 fails to run classes produced by ajc
Java 1.5 beta reports a ClassFormatError when running programs (e.g., spacewar)
compiled by ajc 1.1.1 and the latest CVS head.  Sun's Java 1.5 beta
binary-compatibility docs say that some obfuscators violated the .class format
specification, so those .class files will fail when run under 1.5.  (The docs
also say they are still incomplete.)
Although 1.5 is still beta, we would want to submit a bug to Sun if our
implementation techniques are valid, so we don't have to change those
techniques.  For 1.2, we should at document if we don't fix, since many people
are using 1.5.
