Potentially unclosed stream in org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelWorld

Eclipse workspace patch that closes the stream correctly
In method lookupJavaClass(), one has to close a stream used by ClassParser.
This should be done in a finally block, since parse() may fail and throw an
IOException. Right now, the stream is left open in that case.
A path to correctly close the stream is attached.
