lame error message: "negation doesn't allow binding
AspectJ Compiler 1.1beta4
This program:
public aspect Foo {
pointcut p(int i): call(void f(i));
}
produces these error messages:
negation doesn't allow binding
formal unbound in pointcut
2 errors
It should say something like "binding is only allowed in state-based pointcuts", and it should print the file and line number.
