Can no longer compile JDK 1.5 projects with apsectj for JDeveloper
I am working with AspectJ 1.5.2 in JDeveloper and have found that it is
not possible to convince the compiler to use JDK 5 constructs.

It appears that there is a method on AjcBuildOptions called
getJavaOptionsMap() which is currently implemented to return null in all
cases. In CompilerAdapter.configureBuildOptions areound line 358 the
code tried to access this object to access whether to use JDK 5
constructs or not. Since the return value is always null the project is
never properly configured.

I notice that the only other implementation of the root interface is
CoreBuildOption which appears to directly return a structure from the
eclipse class JavaProject. It would appear that this interface is
breaking the rules on abstraction, is this the correct read on the
situation?
If so the solution would either be to implement a CoreBuildOption class
to correctly work with the ADJE project adapter class or alter the code in
Compiler adapter to correct use the properties in project adapter. I think
that the latter is probably the best as BuildOption assumes a depedency on
Eclipse which shouldn't be there.
We do currently have customer, one in nato, who are currently having to
work around this issue so it would be good to get it resolve for 1.5.3 if possible
But I know I am a bit late for that now do to a lost email.
