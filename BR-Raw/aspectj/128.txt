Allow the ltw configuration to be directly specified rather than discovered on the classpath
Currently the property:
org.aspectj.weaver.loadtime.configuration
can be set to name the ltw configuration file that the loadtime weaver searches for.  The default value is:
META-INF/aop.xml;META-INF/aop-ajc.xml;org/aspectj/aop.xml
and the weaver searches the classpath for .xml files matching any of those three possibilities.
A typical override might therefore be:
-Dorg.aspectj.weaver.loadtime.configuration=META-INF/overhere.xml
however the weaver will still only look for it on the classpath.
In some environments the ltw user may just want to name the aop config file to use, and not be forced to include it on the classpath.
We have had the suggestion to make it protocol based, which i like, but for now I would just allow support for 'file:'.  If file: is the prefix, it will be treated as direct reference to the file to use, otherwise it will be searched for.
This change would mean all existing uses of the override will be fine, but new users will be all to exploit the flexibility of naming their configuration directly.
