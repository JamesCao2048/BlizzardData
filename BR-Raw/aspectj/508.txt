ajc -outjar jarfile does not contain MANIFEST.MF
I call ajc -sourceroots <mydir> -outjar <my.jar> and an output file is created
with a .jar extension, but it is not a valid jar file because there is no
MANIFEST.MF file. I see that the text for ajc says:
-outjar <file>      put output classes in zip file <file>
which might imply that it is supposed to be a zip file, but a parameter called -
outjar which creates a zip file doesn't really make sense. If -outjar is used,
the resulting file should be a valid jar file, i.e. with a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
file inside.
