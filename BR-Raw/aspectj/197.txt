declare error on set of volatile field does not work
When an aspect has a declare error statement involving a pointcut that captures the setting of a volatile field, a compilation error is not produced.
This bug can be reproduced as follows.  Consider the following class:
class A {
private volatile int state;
public void foo() {
state = 0;
}
}
Now consider this aspect:
aspect FSM {
declare error: set(* A.state): "Changing state";
}
The setting of the state field in method foo() does not result in a compilation error as expected.
I originally noticed this bug when using AJDT 1.4 with Eclipse 3.2.  However this has been reproduced and confirmed with the aspectj 1.5.2 compiler.
