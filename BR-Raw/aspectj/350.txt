Unnecessary warning for ITDs
Consider the following aspect:
public aspect RunnableDefaultImpl {
public void Runnable.run() {
}
}
(Note that it makes little sense to have a default implementation for
Runnable. However, I am using it to allow easy reproduction of the bug.)
Compiling this aspect leads to the following warning:
...testRunnableDefaultImpl.aj:9 [warning]
this affected type is not exposed to the weaver: java.lang.Runnable [Xlint:type
NotExposedToWeaver]
public void Runnable.run() {
^^^
This warning isn't really necessary as weaver doesn't (and shouldn't) need
to have Runnable exposed. In fact, everything works as expected already.
Now it will be a good warning (or even error), if I was trying to introduce a
new method, such as in the following aspect:
public aspect RunnableDefaultImpl {
public void Runnable.walk() {
}
}
