"declare parents" does not work with bytecode weaving
1. download and unpack  http://www.fuurou.org/downloads/aspectjtest.zip  (I
couldn't find a way of attaching it)
2. copy the aspectj jars into the lib directory
3. run ant

The ant file executes both source code and byte code weaving and then it
veryfies that the class hierarchy was changed. As you can see from the output
in case of source weaving the test is:

[java] Is [class lib.C] subcass of [class weaved.SuperC]? true

while when weaving bytecode:

[java] Is [class lib.C] subcass of [class weaved.SuperC]? false
