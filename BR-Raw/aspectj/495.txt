Load Time Weaving aborts on any kind of warning (declare/xlint)
The message handler in the weaving adapter for load time weaving says:
public boolean handleMessage(IMessage message) throws AbortException {
if (!isIgnoring(message.getKind())) {
if (verbose) System.err.println(message.getMessage());
throw new AbortException(message);
}
return true;
}
This means for warnings it goes bang.  So, even a declare warning that is
meant to tell the user something informational during a LTW will cause the
code to blow up.  The fix is straightforward and simply to log warning
messages and only fail for error messages.  I am waiting for a testcase from
Matthew before checking in the fix.
