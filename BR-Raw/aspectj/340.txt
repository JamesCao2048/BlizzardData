[ajdoc] add ajdoc support for inter-type declarations and other declare forms
Currently ajdoc only exposes the "Advises" and "Advised by" relationships from
the structure model.
It needs to support inter-type field and member declarations using a UI
similar to how Javadoc presents inherited members.
It also needs to support the other declare forms: error, warning, soft,
parents, and precedence.
