ajdoc doesn't navigate to target details in some cases
When a file is advised, javadoc uses the following naming convention for
setting its "A NAME":
convertCheckedException(java.lang.Throwable)
However, ajdoc uses the unqualified name for the argument, resuting in the
follwing in-file anchor link:
<class-name>.html#convertCheckedException(Throwable)ËÅΩ
Which fails to navigate to the anchor within the file, although it does always
go to the right file.
