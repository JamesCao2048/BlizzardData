Produce a compile warning when default advice precedence is applied
I propose that the compiler spit out a warning anytime that it has to apply
the default advice precedence.  Also, it should spit out the recommendation
that default ordering is not guaranteed from release to release of the
compiler.
You can see the thread on aspectj-dev titled "change in runtime execution
order" and the one on aspectj-users titled "AJDT 1.3 and aspectj" for the
reasoning behind why this is a good thing.
