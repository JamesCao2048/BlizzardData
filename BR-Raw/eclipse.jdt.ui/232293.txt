Bug 232293 – [misc] Turn {@inheritDoc} in Javadoc main description into link
Created attachment 100426 [details]
Fix
Turn {@inheritDoc} in Javadoc main description into a link.
This is a low-risk partial solution to bug 24227 to support common cases like the addition of an @since tag in the overriding method, e.g.
/**
* {@inheritDoc}
*
* @since 3.4
*/
The link points to the Javadoc that would have been displayed without the @since or without a Javadoc comment at all.
