Bug 47097 – [content assist] Pressing Semicolon to commit content assist bypasses smart semicolon
When content assist is present, semicolon will commit the current proposal.
But, the semicolon is not processed in the normal manner by the editor.
setValue(rect.wid<<ASSIST>>)
pressing ";" should add the semicolon at the end of the line when smart
semicolon is enabled.
