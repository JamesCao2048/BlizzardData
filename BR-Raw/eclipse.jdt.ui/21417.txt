Bug 21417 – [type hierarchy] Multi-select java elements and show in Type Hierarchy
F4 can be used for showing a package (or project) in the type hierarchy view.
It would be nice if we could multi select packages and open in the type
hierarchy view using F4.
The use case is that I have a project with 2 source folders and some JARs in
the classpath.
If I use F4 on the project, the hierarchy view also shows the
types in the JARs.
What I'd like to have is only the types in my 2 source
folders.
