Bug 285573 – [quick fix] Wrong quickfix proposal for operations involving double and Integer
Build ID: I20090803-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
Integer value = 4711;
double test = 47d;
value = value + test; //Line3: Error
Line 3 is marked with a compilation error (Type mismatch: cannot convert from double to Integer) and one of the quick fixes suggest "Add a cast to
'Integer'".
However, this is wrong and will not fix the compilation error as double to Integer cast is not allowed.
