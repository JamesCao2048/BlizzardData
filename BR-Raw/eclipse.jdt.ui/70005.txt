Bug 70005 – [content assist] Missing Getter/Setter code assist: proposals
3.0
it sometimes takes two tries to get the getter and setter methods
This happens when the cu isn't reconciled so the avaiable fields are not found.
1.
enter a new field 'foo'
2.
start with getF, code assist > no getter proposal
