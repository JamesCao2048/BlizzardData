Bug 264606 – [extract method] extracting return value results in compile error
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
Use Extract Method on 'foo' in the indicated line.
class Bar {
boolean foo;
private boolean getFoo()
{
return foo; // use 'Extract Method' on 'foo' here
}
private void setFoo(boolean newFoo)
{
this.foo = newFoo; // breaks this line
}
}
More information:
This changes the indicated line in setFoo to:
this.bar() = foo;
which is obviously incorrect.
If the assignment to foo is changed to 'foo = newFoo' (i.e.
without 'this.'), the problem disappears.
