Bug 408937 – [1.8][rename] Unable to rename variables in lambda expression field
Consider the following example and try to rename the variables mentioned in comments using "Alt+Shift+R":
@FunctionalInterface
interface I {
int foo (int x);
}
public class C1 {
I i= (int x) -> { // Unable to Rename "x"
int p= 10; // Unable to Rename "p"
I ii= (int a) -> a+100; // Unable to Rename "ii", "a"
return ii.foo(x) + p;
};
void foo() {
I i= (int x) -> x; // works here
}
}
We get the error, "Only local variables declared in methods and initializers can be renamed".
However, it should be possible to rename variables in any type of lambda expr also.
