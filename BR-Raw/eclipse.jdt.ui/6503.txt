Bug 6503 – Search page - should offer case sensitivity check box
Build 20011127
Due to bug 6423 fix, the API SearchEngine.search(IWorkspace, String, int, int,
IJavaSearchScope, IJavaSearchResultCollector) is now performing a case
insensitive search (more intuitive).
However, the UI page should offer a checkbox for case sensitivity, and rather
use the following call to trigger the search:
SearchEngine.search(workspace, createSearchPattern(patternString, searchFor,
limitTo, caseSensitiveFlag), scope, resultCollector);
