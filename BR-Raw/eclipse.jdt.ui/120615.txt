Bug 120615 – [hovering] Javadoc Viewer doesn't display {@link ... } properly if text is just whitespace
I20051213-0010
While browsing doc using the viewer I noticed that the following java doc excerpt from the merge method in IMergeContext:
* For two-way merging, clients can either accept changes using the
* {@link #merge(IDiffNode[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) } method or reject
* them using {@link #markAsMerged(IFile, boolean, IProgressMonitor) }.
corresponds to the following output in the Javadoc viewer:
For two-way merging, clients can either accept changes using the method or reject them using .
It seems that this is only true for links to local methods.
