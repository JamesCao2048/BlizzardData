Bug 440930 – Java member types which are implicitly static should have consistent icons
Member classes are non-static by default (unless they are members of interfaces or annotation types, in which case they are static by default) but they may be marked static explicitly.
Member enums, member interfaces, and member annotation types are static by default but they may be marked static explicitly.
However, Eclipse displays a different type icon for these if they are marked static explicitly.
Since the addition of the modifier does not change the meaning of the code, it should not change the icon.
class C {
class C1 {}
static class C2 {}
enum E1 { X }
static enum E2 { X }
interface I1 {}
static interface I2 {}
@interface A1 {}
static @interface A2 {}
}
interface I {
class C3 {}
static class C4 {}
enum E3 { X }
static enum E4 { X }
interface I3 {}
static interface I4 {}
@interface A3 {}
static @interface A4 {}
}
In this example, types C1, E1, I1, A1 have no 'S' in their icon.
Types C2, E2, I2, A2 have an 'S' in their icon.
However, E1, I1, A1 are static too, so they should also have the 'S' in their icon.
For comparison, all of the *3 and *4 types (the members of I) are static, and do consistently display the 'S', even though the *3 are only static implicitly.
Note that the only member type in the example code that is not static is C1.
