Bug 185172 – [working sets] 'New' action not available if >1 working set selected
I20070502-0010.
If I want to create a new Java project and directly add it to a working set I can select the working set and then 'context menu' > New > 'Java Project'.
However, if I want to create the new Java project directly into >1 working sets I'm doomed as the context menu is missing.
