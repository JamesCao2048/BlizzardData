Bug 406995 – [content assist] Context Information is not shown after completion of void method
With the automatic addition of ';' to void-returning method completion proposals, we don't show Context Information any more for such completions.
Example: Complete after "wait" here and choose a method with parameters:
package xy;
public class CompletionTest {
{
wait
}
}
The problem in this case is that JavaMethodCompletionProposal#computeContextInformation() needs another condition
"|| getReplacementString().endsWith(SEMICOLON)".
Need to check other proposals as well.
