Bug 307756 – [compare] Compare with local history reverts changes in dirty editor
I20100330-0800
Compare with local history reverts changes in a dirty Java editor.
This leads to data loss if the user doesn't notice it.
Steps:
- Paste this:
package xy;
public class Try {
public static void main(String[] args) {
//        System.out.println();
}
}
- uncomment the sysout
- Save
- add "Hello" as argument of println()
- context menu > Compare With > Local History...
- double-click the most recent revision (the bold one)
=> compare editor is opened and "Hello" is removed in the local revision (in both editors)
This works fine for a plain text compare editor.
