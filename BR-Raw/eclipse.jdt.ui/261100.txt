Bug 261100 – [common navigator] Dragging FileTransfer to closed project shows "valid drop"
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #218574 +++
Another thing I noticed while testing was that dragging a local selection onto a closed project results in the icon changing to 'no drop'.
 However, dragging a file transfer onto a closed project results in the icon being a 'valid drop'.
 Actually performing the drop resulted in an error dialog saying the destination did not exist.
