Bug 62896 – [misc] Quick Outline should not show override indicators if decorator disabled
I20040519
The quick outline shows override indicators no matter whether the Override
indicator decorator is enabled in the prefs or not.
We should only install the
decorator if the prefs says so since this is a performance saver.
