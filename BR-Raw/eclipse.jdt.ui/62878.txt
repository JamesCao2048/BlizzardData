Bug 62878 – [misc] Mark Occurrences of exceptions/types inconsistent
I200405190010
- disable Mark Exceptions
- enable Mark Types
- in TestCase:
- position cursor on Throwable of runBare() declaration
-> type Throwable is marked
- posititon cursor on Throwable of runTest() delcaration
-> type Throwable is not marked
This is inconsistent.
