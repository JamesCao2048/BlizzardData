Bug 1708 – Consistency in the presentation of the Display, Run, Inspect (1GJUH54)
DS (9/10/01 10:55:55 AM)
The consistency is between the Snippet Editor and the Java Editor.
In the Java Editor the actions are in the popup menu: Inspect, Display ...
why no Run
the actions are not in the edit menu of the workbench
In the SnippetEditor the actions are in the popup menu: Display, Inspect
the actions are in the edit menu of the workbench
NOTES:

Actions should be ordered the same.
We have no "run" in the debug context, as it is
really just a snippet usage - i.e.
run some code.
Generally, when debugging, it is less
useful to just "run" some code - usually you need to inspect a result.
However, to be
consistent, we should have the same options in both contexts, and we should add
to the edit menu consistently.
