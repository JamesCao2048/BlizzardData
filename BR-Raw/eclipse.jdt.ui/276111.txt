Bug 276111 – [JUnit] classpath container doesn't pick up JUnit jars in shared installations
Build ID: I20090430-2300
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
have an Eclipse shared install (for example on Linux), in a read only dir (eg /usr/local/eclipse)
2.
make sure you don't have a ~/.eclipse dir yet (more specifically, no bundles.txt in that for your configuration)
3.
start Eclipse
4.
load a Java project with JUnit container added to the build path
5.
see that JUnit container didn't find the junit.jar - test cases won't compile
More information:
I think this is related to the 'bundles.txt' file, the JUnit classpath container looks for that in the user's home (~/.eclipse) to find 'junit.jar' in the org.junit bundle.
I guess the problem is either that:
* it should not look at there at all, just use the shared bundles.txt (as suggested by http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox_p2_Shared_Install_Plan), or
* P2 should make sure the user-level bundles.txt exists.
Earlier milestones (like 3.5M6) seems to work like that.
One thing that suggest the problem may be in Junit plugin's side, is this comment:
