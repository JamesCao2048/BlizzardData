Bug 262763 – [jar exporter] remove Built-By attribute in ANT files from Fat JAR Exporter
I20090127-2000
The ANT files generated by the fat JAR exporter contain a "Built-By" attribute.
This is non-standard and does not show up when the JAR is generated by the wizard, so it should also not show up in the script.
