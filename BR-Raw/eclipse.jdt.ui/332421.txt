Bug 332421 – [nls tooling] Hyperlink on properties file key doesn't work across projects
N20101212-2000
- import org.eclipse.ui.ide and org.eclipse.ui.ide.application from CVS
- open this file:
/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/messages.properties
- Ctrl+Click on the key on line 952:
IDEApplication_workspaceCannotLockTitle=Workspace Cannot Be Locked
=> just beeps but doesn't open the reference in IDEApplication#checkInstanceLocation(Shell).
Problem is probably that the reference is in another plug-in.
