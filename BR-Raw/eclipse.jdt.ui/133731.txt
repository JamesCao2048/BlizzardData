Bug 133731 – [Field Assist] -Platform UI should define preferences for content assist colors
JDT currently provides preferences for content assist popup colors, auto-activation delay time, etc.
Platform Text implementations typically hard-coded these values (such as auto-activation delay).
The new field assist support generally attempted to mimic the defaults used by platform text.
 However it is reasonable in the long run to provide preferences for these values.
 Examples include:
- main popup color
- secondary popup color
- autoactivation delay
When this is investigated, check for the state of the art in JDT prefs.
