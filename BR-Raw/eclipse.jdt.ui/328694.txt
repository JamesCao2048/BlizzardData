Bug 328694 – [call hierarchy] Clearing history should clear the status bar of the view
I20101025-1800
Steps
- Open call hierarchy on a method
- Call Hierarchy view > History > Clear History => the status bar at the top of the view still says "Members calling 'foo() - in workspace"
This works correctly in Search view
