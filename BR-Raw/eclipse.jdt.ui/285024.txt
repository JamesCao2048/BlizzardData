Bug 285024 – [ltk] Cannot run PerformChangeOperation in "null" ISchedulingRule
It is not fair for the PerformChangeOperation#setSchedulingRule() API call to not allow a "null" scheduling rule.
There are some TextChange's that do not require any rules at all to run, like DocumentChange.
Please loosen the API restrictions to allow a null scheduling rule.
