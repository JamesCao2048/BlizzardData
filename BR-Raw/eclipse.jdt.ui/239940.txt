Bug 239940 – [implementation] NPE while editing a javadoc comment
Using I20080702-0939.
I was editing a simple class:
public class X01 {
/**
* <pre>
* Unclosed pre tag
*/
int foo;
/**
* Sample showing that the formatter does not handle
* unclosed html tags properly
*
* @return  here's a simple return tag which description lines
* should be indented when using default Eclipse built-in profile.
* however due to the unclosed html 'pre' tag in the field javadoc
* comment, this return tag won't be formatted!
*/
public abstract int bar();
}
As I get a compiler error on method bar(), I decided to change this test case to an interface...
So, I performed the following changes:
1) change 'class X01' to 'interface X01'
2) remove the abstract modifier on method bar
3) try to change 'foo' to a method:
=> put the cursor after the name 'foo' (go directly at this point, do not
fly or click elsewhere...)
=> the NPE in JavadocView should happen then...
I did it 4 times and the NPE ccured 3 times.
I hope you can also reproduce it with this scenario...
