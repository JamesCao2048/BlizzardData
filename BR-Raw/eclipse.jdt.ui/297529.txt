We are facing compatibility issues between the 3.4 and 3.6 Eclipse versions.
And we would really appreciate if you can help us get it back.
I have summarized the issues that we are facing :-
1) fOutlineSelectionChangedListener method in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JavaEditor has been removed.
2) org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.workingsets.JavaWorkingSetUpdater.ID constant removed.
And the following two internals removed:-
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.refactoring.RefactoringSaveHelper
and org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.actions.ValidBreakpointLocationLocator
Thanks,
Rekha
Reproducible: Always
