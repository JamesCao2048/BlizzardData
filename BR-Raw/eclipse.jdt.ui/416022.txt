Bug 416022 – Clean Up Refactoring should report which file caused the exception (was: Eclipse code formatter crashes with exception in handling Cp1252 character encoding)
Performed code formatting at project level containing more than 100 Java files.
Expected: The code must be formatted as per the template.
Actual: The formatter threw exception saying: Some characters cannot be mapped using "Cp1252" character encoding.
Either change the encoding or remove the characters which are not supported by the "Cp1252" character encoding.
There are two problems here:
1) The root cause for the exception
2) The exception details are not enough - it doesn't state in which file the exception occurred.
Now I have to dig through all the files one by one.
