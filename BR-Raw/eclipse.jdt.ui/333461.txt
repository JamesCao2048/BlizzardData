Bug 333461 – [actions] Javadoc view: "Open Attached Javadoc in External Browser" should open URL
N20101221-2000
Show Javadoc of org.eclipse.swt.layout.FormLayout in the Javadoc view.
Scroll down and click the link "Sample code and further information".
This shows the linked URL in the Javadoc view.
But now, I have no way to open the shown page in an external browser.
I see 2 solutions (preferring A):
A) When the Javadoc view shows an URL, rename the button / context menu action to "Open in External Browser" and then open the URL.
B) Never show a linked page in the Javadoc view, but always open an external browser (like the Javadoc hover).
