Bug 397842 – Class file shown with incorrect content
If output folder is equal to source folder, trying to open a class file shows previous content of source file.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Create new Java project.
Use project folder as root for sources and class files for simplicity.
2.
Create new class X.
3.
Build project, X.class is generated.
4.
Try to open X.class.
=> ClassFileEditor is opened for X.class showing content of X.java.
5.
Modify X.java e.g.
add new method.
6.
Build project, X.class is regenerated.
7.
Try to open X.class.
=> ClassFileEditor is opened for X.class showing previous content of X.java.
In point 4 and 7, if output folder was different than source folder, ClassFileEditor would show "Source not found" message and correct compiled content of X.java.
