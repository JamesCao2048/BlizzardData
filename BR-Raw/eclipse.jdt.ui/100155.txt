Bug 100155 – [hovering] Hover labels for local variables
RC2
Hover over a local variable, e.g.
x.
The hover shows:
'int p.Try2.m().x'
in 3.0 we showed
'int x - p.Try2.m()'
which I think is much better.
As a side note, the important information should be (besides the type of the
variable), that this is a local variable or a parameter.
class Try2 {
int m() {
int x = 0;
return x;
}
}
