Bug 479109 – [formatter] Add option to group aligned fields with blank lines
With Mars.1 the formatter now does NOT restart the alignment after whitespace.
So now ALL fields in the file are aligned.
This is quite annoying to me since my files are divided in 'functional blocks'.
Please fix this so that the alignment is restarted after whitespace
