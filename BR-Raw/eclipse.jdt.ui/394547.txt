Bug 394547 – [extract class] Extract class refactoring on a field in an inner non-static class yields compilation error
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Invoke "Extract Class..." on "m" in code below
2.
Specify "Nested Class in 'C'
3.
There is a compilation error in the resulting file ("cannot be declared static")
class ExtractClassBug {
class C {
// Invoke "Extract Class..." on "m" (and specify "Nested Class in 'C'"
int m;
}
}
