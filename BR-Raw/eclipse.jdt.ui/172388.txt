Bug 172388 – [open type] Open Type dialog shows different JRE libraries with identical text
Build ID: I20061214-1445
Steps To Reproduce:
1) Compile your own rt.jar for jdk1.6.0, with all debugging information included, for example.
 (An exact copy will do for purposes of time.)  Name it rt_g.jar.
2) Go to Eclipse Preferences, Java, Installed JREs.
 Copy existing "jdk1.6.0" to "jdk1.6.0_debug".
3) Edit "jdk1.6.0" debug, including built "rt_g.jar" directly above default "rt.jar".
4) Create 2 projects in workspace, one using the default "jdk1.6.0" JRE, the other using the customized "jdk1.6.0_debug" JRE.
5) Bring up the "Open Type" dialog.
 Search for java.lang.Object.
 2 identical entries will appear:
Object - java.lang - [jdk1.6.0]
Object - java.lang - [jdk1.6.0]
There is no way to differentiate between these two.
 However, opening either does, in fact, open 2 different files.
 One opens the Object.class (showing source) for the instance in rt.jar.
 The other shows the instance from rt_g.jar.
6) These tagged names appear to be the name as entered on the JRE under preferences.
 Renaming "jdk1.6.0" to "test jdk1.6.0" will result in a repeat of this test showing:
Object - java.lang - [test jdk1.6.0]
Object - java.lang - [test jdk1.6.0]
7) Now, removing the ORIGINAL "jdk1.6.0" all together (now called "test jdk1.6.0") shows a different result:
Object - java.lang - C:\Program FilesJava\jdk1.6.0\jre\lib\rt.jar
Object - java.lang - C:\Program FilesJava\jdk1.6.0\rt_g.jar
(The above looks much more like what I would like / expect.)
8) Copying the "jdk1.6.0_debug" back to "jdk1.6.0", AND removing the rt_g.jar from the later will reproduce the undesired result:
Object - java.lang - [jdk1.6.0]
Object - java.lang - [jdk1.6.0]
