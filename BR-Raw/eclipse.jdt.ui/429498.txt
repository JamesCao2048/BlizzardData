Bug 429498 – [1.8][refactoring] Change Method Signature refactoring breaks lambda
interface I {
public void doit();
}
public class X {
I i = () -> {};
}
Change I.doit()'s signature - the lambda does not compile anymore.
Now that declarations in hierarchy correctly tags the lambda as implementing
I.doit, expectation is that this should work.
