Bug 407056 – [1.8] Support PackageQualifiedType AST node
Support the new PackageQualifiedType AST node from bug 404489 in JDT UI.
The node occurs when a type-use annotation is added to a package-qualified type.
Before, such types were represented as SimpleType(QualifiedName).
See the explanations in the Javadoc of QualifiedType in BETA_JAVA8.
