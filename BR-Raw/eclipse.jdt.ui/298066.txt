Bug 298066 – [nls tooling] Refactoring removes comments in *.properties when done for a message key
I20091215-1320
Steps:
1.
Checkout o.e.compare
2.
Open /org.eclipse.compare/compare/org/eclipse/compare/internal/patch/PatchMessages.java
3.
Select InputPatchPage_SingleFileError_format field
4.
Do Refactor > Rename or Alt+Shift+R with Rename Dialog
5.
Change the field name
6.
Examine changes made to PatchMessages.properties in the preview dialog
=> Lines below 'InputPatchPage_SingleFileError_format', those starting with '#' are selected for removal.
I think this should not happen.
