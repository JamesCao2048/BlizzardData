Bug 335224 – [JUnit] New JUnit Test Case wizard doesn't store method stub selection state
HEAD
The New JUnit Test Case wizard doesn't store method stub selection state when you click Finish on the first page.
Reason is that NewTestCaseWizardPageOne#saveWidgetValues() is only called on setVisible(false).
