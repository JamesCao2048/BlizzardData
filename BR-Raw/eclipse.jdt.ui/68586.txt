Bug 68586 – [implementation] Reconciling should be more robust
Cheetah as of 20040625
In situations where the compiler/reconcile has bugs like in early Cheetah,
editor contents cannot be saved properly, also see bug 68557 for an example.
We should make our support more robust, and capture such failures as
JavaModelExceptions (similar to batch compiler handling).
