Bug 64419 – Tomcat example does not need "web app root" attribute
The Tomcat/JSP launching example currently requires the user specify a "web
app root" on the main tab.
However, all we need is the project (in order to
compute a classpath for extra java files and source lookup path).
We used to
require the attribute for source lookup.
