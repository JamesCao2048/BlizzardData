Bug 190438 – [working sets] Assign Working Sets dialog forgets settings after adding and moving new working set
I20070601-0010
I had the platform and jdt doc plugins in two different working sets:
- WS JDT: jdt.doc
- WS Platform: platform.doc
- selected all doc plug-ins
- Assign Working Sets...
- New..., create WS "Doc" with selection
- uncheck both grey-checked WS (JDT & Platform)
- click link "Package Explorer working sets"
- move WS Doc up or down
- OK
=> WS JDT and WS Platform are grey-checked again
=> Expected: check state should not be changed when working sets are moved around
