Bug 450208 – [quick fix] Create method quickfix not working for methods using type variables
Normally when I have an error because my code is calling a non-existant method, then CTRL+1 will show me a quickfix to create the method.
This is mighty useful :-)
Unfortunately when the method that needs to be created has a generic method signature than the quickfix is not suggested.
This is fairly annoying if you have gotten used to having this quickfix available.
To reproduce here is a concrete example:
---------------------------------------------------------------->8
package bork.it;
public class Bork<T> {
Class<T> type;
private Help help = new Help();
public void method() {
help.help(this);
}
}
class Help {
<T> void help(T requestor) {
return;
}
}
---------------------------------------------------------------->8
Comment the method Help.help.
Try to invoke quick fixes on the error that appears on the call to help.help.
You will see the option to create the method
is missing.
