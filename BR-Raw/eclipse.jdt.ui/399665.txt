Bug 399665 – Part references leak view/editor site after part is disposed
In the E4 compatibility layer, part references leak the view/editor site after the part is disposed.
Via selection provider, this leaks the whole part.
IWorkbenchPartReference is intended to be a lightweight reference to a part that can be kept even after the part has been disposed.
E.g.
the Search view uses this to keep a reference to the last opened editor, so that it can reuse it when you step through matches.
Here's the reference chain:
org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditor
this$0 of org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.AbstractTextEditor$SelectionProvider
selectionProvider of org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditorSite
editorSite of org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditorReference
fReusedEditor of org.eclipse.search.internal.ui.text.EditorOpener
fEditorOpener of org.eclipse.search.internal.ui.text.FileSearchPage
fPage of org.eclipse.search2.internal.ui.basic.views.SetLayoutAction
action of org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem
innerItem of org.eclipse.jface.action.SubContributionItem
data of org.eclipse.swt.widgets.MenuItem
[8] of org.eclipse.swt.widgets.MenuItem[64]
items of org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display [JNI Global, Stack Local]
