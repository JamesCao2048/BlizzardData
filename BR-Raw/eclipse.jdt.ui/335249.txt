Bug 335249 – [preferences] Improve grouping of "Potential programming problems" on Errors/Warnings page
Improve grouping of options on Errors/Warnings page.
"Potential programming problems" is too big and without logical order.
It could be split into options that affect
- members (method signatures, serial id)
- expressions
- statements and blocks
Or we could just order them by scope.
