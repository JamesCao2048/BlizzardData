Bug 324237 – [extract method] Extract Method refactoring fails if trailing ';' is also part of selection
I20100831-1001
ok, I have faced this too many times now...
Steps:
- Use this snippet and select "122;"
package p;
class A {
int i;
void foo() {
this.i = 122;
}
}
- Alt + Shift + M (Extract Method) => The end of selection contains characters that do not belong to a statement.
-- bad!!
Selecting the trailing ';' is very easy - I generally place the cursor right after '=' and then press Shift + End (to select till end of the line).
Extract Method refactoring should simply ignore the trailing ';' instead of complaining about it.
