Bug 26070 – [code manipulation] [dcr] toString() builder wizard
It would be nice to have a wizard that acts similar to the Generate Getter and
Setter wizard in that a user is presented with a GUI that displays all of the
fields associated with a class.
 If a field is unchecked, the field would be
removed from the toString().
 It would also be nice to be able to control the
order of the fields.
