Bug 201878 – [quick fix] improve cursor jumping on CTRL + 1
3.3
If CTRL + 1 finds warnings or errors on the same line, it jumps to the closest error and offers proposals for that error.
Users would like to have more control over that:
- they didn't want to fix the closest error but do a quick assist at the cursor location (see bug 201872)
- they want to fix a different bug on the same line (or close to the cursor)
- they want to fix an error on a different line
