Bug 76439 – Classfile editor: Allow source attachment option for classes in class folders
20041017
When you open a class file for a class folder that has no source attchment you
see a message 'No source available...' but no button that brings you to the
source attachment page like it is done for JARs.
ClassfileEditor line 225 is too restrictive, the test .isArchive() seems to be
too much
