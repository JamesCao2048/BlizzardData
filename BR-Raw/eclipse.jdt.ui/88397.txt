Bug 88397 – [5.0] OpenAction does not select whole ITypeParameter
I20050315-1100
OpenAction does not select whole ITypeParameter.
public class Cell {
public <T> void f(T arg) { }
}
In a source editor, set the caret around a T and press F3
Was: caret is before T
Expected: T is selected
Note that ITypeParameter#getSourceRange() is broken for binary types (bug 88394).
