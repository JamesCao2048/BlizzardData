Bug 285814 – [clean up] 'Remove unnecessary $NLS-TAGS$' removes necessary ones in case of syntax errors
The save action 'Remove unnecessary $NLS-TAGS$' has removed all my neccessary tags of a file more than once.
This now stops me from using the otherwise great feature.
Here is an example how to reproduce the issue:
1) Enable the save action.
2) Start with the following code and save it.
public class Test {
String bla= "";  //$NON-NLS-1$
}
3) Change the keyword 'void' and save the file:
public class Test {
void
String bla= "";  //$NON-NLS-1$
}
4) The tag is removed :-(.
public class Test {
void
String bla= "";
}
