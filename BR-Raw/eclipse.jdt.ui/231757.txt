Bug 231757 – [implementation] NPE in JavaEditor.handlePreferenceStoreChanged at startup
Created attachment 99901 [details]
[NPE Stack trace]
eclipse.buildId=I20080510-2000
(see NPE details in the attached file)
After upgrading to the latest level, starting Eclipse with the above build against an existing workspace.
Active perspective at startup was Debug (also had Java, Team Synch and CVS perspectives)
NPE was displayed in an error message once UI became visible.
Problem not reproduced after several startup or with other workspaces.
So, opening bug just to keep a trace of this pb.
