Bug 11317 – Won't export some files to .jar.
Create a new java project called "Foo".
In the file system, create a folder named "Foo scripts", and in this folder
create a file named "foo.txt".
Drag this folder into the eclipse packages view and add it to the "Foo" project.
Now try to export the project "Foo" to a .jar file.
 Only the manifest file
shows up, even if the file "foo.txt" is checked!
