Bug 298031 – [JUnit] Test cases not found when @RunWith annotation on binary super class
When a class extends a binary type annotated with @RunWith, the binary type has no source attachment, and the user selects the compilation unit -> Run As -> JUnit Test, a dialog appears that says no test class can be found.
When the class itself is selected, then the class is recognized as a test class.
 Similarly, when a source attachment is added, the test class can be found.
