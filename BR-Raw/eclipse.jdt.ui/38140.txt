Bug 38140 – SnippetOpenOnSelectionAction subclasses OpenAction although OpenAction isn't made for subclassing
Build 20030527
SnippetOpenOnSelectionAction subclasses JDT/UI's OpenAction.
To fix bug 37846
we have to make all run and selectionChanged methods public.
Please adjsut the
visibility of the selectionChanged(ITextSelection selection) method from
protected to public.
