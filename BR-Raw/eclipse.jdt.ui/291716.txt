Bug 291716 – [package explorer] hides jars non-java resources when working set is selected
I am not sure if this is the right component.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Create a java project that has a jar with resources (f.e.
properties file) in the referenced libraries.
2.
Open package explorer, set top level element to projects, deselect all working sets.
3.
Expand the jar.
Notice all files (java classes and resource file)
4.
Assign the project to any working set.
Select the working set.
5.
Expand the jar.
Resource files (.properties, Manifest) are gone.
This is not what user expects.
And also gives false impression about jar file state.
