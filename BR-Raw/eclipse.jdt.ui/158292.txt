Bug 158292 – [misc] add document performance tests
3.3M2
We should regularly run performance tests on the document and text store.
There already are performance tests for the line tracker.
The patch I will attach adds abstract performance tests for any IDocument and ITextStore implementations, as well as concrete tests for the following classes:
- org.eclipse.jface.text.Document
- org.eclipse.jface.text.GapTextStore
- org.eclipse.jface.text.SequentialRewriteTextStore

Implementation:
Looking at some performance tests reveals that often boilerplate code needs to be written for performance tests (example: LineTrackerPerformanceTest): typically, a testXXX method does the following four things:
- create performance meters for warm-up and measuring
- call the measureXXX method N times with the warm-up meter
- call the measureXXX method M times with the measurement meter
- commit and assert performance measurements
The provided patch provides a specialized TestCase (PerformanceTestCase2) that does exactly that in its #runTest method.
Similar, there is a specialized TestSuite (PerfTestSuite) that uses reflection to find any methods that start with "measure" and take one argument of type PerformanceMeter.
