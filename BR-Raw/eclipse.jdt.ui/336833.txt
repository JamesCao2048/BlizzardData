Bug 336833 – [ltk][refactoring] Allow for context help on DIALOG_BASED_USER_INTERFACE
Currently you have to use a wizard (WIZARD_BASED_USER_INTERFACE) to show any context sensitive help in a refactoring dialog.
 This is cumbersome particularly when your refactoring dialog is quite large already and you don't want to add the title area.
Also since many refactoring dialogs are quite complex, adding the title area tends to clutter the UI and make it harder on users.
On a cursory glance, RefactoringWizardDialog2 would just need extend TrayDialog.
