Bug 20288 – JAR export does not explain problem
Select a source folder.
Right-menu/Export...
JAR File, Next
Type in a relative path (or so I thought), e.g.
"myproject/lib/myjar.jar"
Next, Next, Finish
At this point, I get a dialog box which asks me if I want to create the
directory.
 (Would be helpful to tell what directory it's actually thinking of
creating.)  If I click "Yes", I'm taken back to the last dialog with no
explanation of what went wrong.
If, instead, I answer "No", it actually tells me what directory was missing.
