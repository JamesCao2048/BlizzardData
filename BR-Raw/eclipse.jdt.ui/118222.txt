Bug 118222 – [nls tooling] nls tooling is not .java agnostic
I20051123-1200
I found a few places where the nls tooling is currently not aware of java-like extensions (bug 89977):
- PropertyKeyHyperlink hardcodes "*.java"
- NLSSearchPage only searches for java files with extension "java"
They should take the java-like extensions from JavaCore#getJavaLikeExtensions().
