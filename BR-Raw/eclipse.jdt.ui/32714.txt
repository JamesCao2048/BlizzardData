Bug 32714 – Packages View: flickering and loosing expanded state when logical package is selected with hierarchical layout
In the java browsing perspective:
- enable hierarchical layout for the packages view
- select a logical package in the packages view
- select types/methods in the types/methods views
-> the packages view flickers and looses the expanded state (the tree is only
expanded upto the logical package, other expanded subtrees are collapsed)
