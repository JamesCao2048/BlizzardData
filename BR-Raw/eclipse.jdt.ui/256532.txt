Bug 256532 – [templates] TemplateProposals has API that should be marked deprecated
The TemplateProposals class has the following methods that should be marked as deprecated:
/*
* @see ICompletionProposal#apply(IDocument)
*/
public final void apply(IDocument document) {
// not called anymore
}
/*
* @see org.eclipse.jface.text.contentassist.ICompletionProposalExtension#apply(org.eclipse.jface.text.IDocument, char, int)
*/
public void apply(IDocument document, char trigger, int offset) {
// not called any longer
}
