Bug 393098 – [extract method] Extracted method should be declared static if extracted expression is also used in another static method
Extracted method should be declared static if extracted expression is also used in another static method.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
In the example below invoke "Extract Method" on "shared()" expression in non-static method (nsm).
2.
New method will not be declared as static.
3.
There will be a compilation error because non-static method is invoked from static context.
Note: Originally the bug was encountered when extracting "getTestConstructor(theClass)" on line 136 in junit.framework.TestSuite, JUnit commit e8b91fa9f797dfe16aff66ed6ad5d6104e5133fe.
public class ExtractMethodBug {
public static void sm() {
// Compilation error will be on the next line
shared();
}
public void nsm() {
// Invoke Extract Method refactoring on the "shared()" expression
shared();
}
public static void shared() {
}
}
