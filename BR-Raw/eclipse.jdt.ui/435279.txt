Bug 435279 – [Hover] NPE when Annotation not visible on classpath
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #435213 +++
> The hover is not shown.
Instead of that a NPE is shown in the errorlog.
Manju, please prepare a patch that avoids the NPE in JavadocHover#addAnnotation(..).
It's OK if the link is not resolvable, but an unresolvable link should not block the Javadoc hover.
