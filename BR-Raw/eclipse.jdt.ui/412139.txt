Bug 412139 – [hovering] Links in Javadoc hover/view headers don't resolve fully-qualified types correctly
Links in Javadoc hover/view headers don't resolve fully-qualified types correctly.
Many examples can be found in org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ASTConverter, e.g.
recordNodes(ASTNode node, org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.ASTNode oldASTNode).
The Javadoc tool generates title attributes like "class or interface in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast" for links to types.
We could also generate titles, but we better just use "in <package>" syntax.
