Bug 320983 – [hovering] Javadoc does not display properly on classes with a generic type that's also an HTML element name
Build Identifier: M20090917-0800
Using the following code:
public abstract class Test<T> {
public static void main(String[] args) {
new Test<Button>() {
void foo() {
}
};
new Test<Strike>() {
void foo() {
}
};
}
}
When you hover over the name of either foo() method, the Javadoc rendering that shows is wrong: The first one displays an HTML button element containing everything after the class name, the second one strikes through that text.
See attached screenshot.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create an anonymous instance of a class with a generic type
2.
Implement a method in that class
3.
View the javadoc on that method
