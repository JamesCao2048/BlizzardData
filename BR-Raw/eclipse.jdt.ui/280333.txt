Bug 280333 – [refactoring] enhance Javadoc of RefactoringWizard.performFinish() (was: Refactoring wizard remains open with enabled buttons after refactoring operation completes)
Refactoring wizard remains open with enabled buttons after refactoring operation completes.
When an extension of the org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring.RefactoringWizard performs steps after the call to org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring.RefactoringWizard.performFinish() in the <subclass>.performFinish() method, the refactoring wizard remains open with the Finish/Next buttons enabled until the <subclass>.performFinish() method terminates.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a extension of the org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring.RefactoringWizard.
2) In the <subclass>.performFinish() method, call org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring.RefactoringWizard.performFinish() and then:
try {
Thread.sleep(5000);
}
catch (Exception e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
3) Open the refactoring wizard and finish the operation (click Finish).
4) Note the Next/Finish buttons remain disabled until the refactoring operation terminates and then enable for the 5 second sleep before the refactoring wizard is closed.
