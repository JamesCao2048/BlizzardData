Bug 490337 – Technically incorrect language in quick fix for inheriting multiple interface methods
The language for the quick fix is technically incorrect in the following situation.
Suppose we have the following:
interface I {
void m();
}
interface J {
default void m() {
}
}
class A implements I, J {
}
Here, A must choose to either implement I.m() or override J.m().
However, the two quick fix options state to override I.m() or override J.m().
Technically, the first option should be to *implement* I.m() (the language for the J.m() option is correct).
