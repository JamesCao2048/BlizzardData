Bug 266646 – Change CommonDropAdapter method call
The CommonDropAdapter.setCurrentOperation() is replaced by overrideOperation().
 These are both new API introduced in M5.
 As soon as JDT switches over to overriderOperation(), I will delete setCurrentOperation().
 They both do exactly the same thing.
I will provide a patch.
