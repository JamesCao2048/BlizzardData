Bug 260992 – [clean up] Improper enhanced for-loop conversion on descendingIterator()
Build ID: M20080911-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
Type some code like this:
NavigableSet<?> set = ...
for (Iterator<?> it = set.descendingIterator(); it.hasNext();) {
Object element = it.next();
System.out.println(element);
}
Run the "Convert for loops to enhanced" code cleanup.
You get:
for (Object element : set) {
System.out.println(element);
}
But this iterates through the elements of set in ascending order, when the original code went in descending order.
More information:
Probably the code that detects whether enhanced for-loop conversion is possible should verify that the Iterator is being obtained through a call to Iterable.iterator() and not some other method like NavigableSet.descendingIterator().
