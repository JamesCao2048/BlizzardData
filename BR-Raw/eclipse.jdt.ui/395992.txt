Bug 395992 – [generalize type] Generalize Declared Type offers types that are not visible
Steps to reproduce:
1.
See the instructions in code below
2.
The resulting code does not compile ("The type AbstractStringBuilder is not visible")
class GeneralizeDeclaredTypeBug6 {
void f() {
// Invoke "Generalize Declared Type" on "StringBuffer"
// and select "AbstractStringBuffer" as new type
StringBuffer b;
}
}
Result:
class GeneralizeDeclaredTypeBug6 {
void f() {
AbstractStringBuilder b;
}
}
