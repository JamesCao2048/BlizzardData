Bug 71627 – [code style] don't generate redundant modifiers "public static final abstract" for interface members
There should be a preference (on the Code Style page?) where users can configure
modifiers to be generated for new interface members.
The JLS allows to redundantly add any of
- "public static final" to a field declaration,
- "public static" to a class declaration,
- "public abstract" to a method declaration in an interface.
I'd suggest to add 4 checkboxes with label "Add redundant modifiers to interface
members:".
Move Static Members and Extract Interface should respect this preference.
