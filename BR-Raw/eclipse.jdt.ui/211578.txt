Bug 211578 – [build path] Dialog to extend classpath variable slow
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
get a big 3rd party repository on the hard disk >400 folders
2.
define a jdt classpath variable to point to the base folder
3.
configure the classpath on a java project, on the libraries tab click "Add Variable..."
4.
double click or select and click "Extend..." the classpath variable defined before
5.
-> eclipse hangs some seconds (sometimes >10 sec.) until the dialog opens
More information:
Subsequent uses are somewhat faster but still too slow.
Maybe it is possible to optimize it on subsequent openings.
We are currently editing the .classpath file direct with a text editor.
This is faster for us.
Maybe this is related to the windows file system, however I cannot prove this on a e.g.
linux machine (I don't have one at work).
Our development computers are up-to-date hardware.
