Bug 61212 – [search] Search requestor should not populate Java model
I20040506
I noticed that JavaSearchResult.isShownInEditor(...) populates the Java model
because it uses getUnderlyingResource().
In this particular case, it should
use getRessource() which is a handle-only method.
In general, the SearchRequestor should not call anything than handle-only
methods (see Java doc of these methods: if it doesn't say it is a handle-only
method, it will populate the Java model).
If you need to call non-handle-only methods (like IType.isClass()), JDT Core
can surely provide an API on SearchMatch that will return the right answer.
