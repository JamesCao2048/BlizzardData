Bug 47729 – Unable to ignore '*,D' files [filters]
I am using Aegis which produces files having the extension ',D', e.g.
'MyClass.java,D'.
I want to ignore these files from being shown in the Package Explorer.
I tried
the filter in
Project - Properties - Java Build Path - Source - Exclusion Filter
but failed.
I tried
**/*,D
**/*.java,D
**/*.java?D
without success.
Seems as if this filter only ignores .java files.
The only help
I found was the filter for 'non-java elements', but then my .properties files
disappear, too.
