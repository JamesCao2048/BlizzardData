Bug 7845 – API needed in Combo class to specify # of items visible
We need an API for org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo that will allow us to specify
the number of visible elements.
This is needed for usability enhancement.
It is
acceptable if this feature is not supported on all platforms.
We are primarily
concerned with the feature working on Windows systems.
This issue was raised because the setBounds(int, int, int, int, int) method in
Combo in the Windows version of Eclipse automatically sets the number of
elements visible to 5.
For the drop down perspectives list on the Eclipse
toolbar in particular, we wanted to be able to specify the number of elements
that would be shown without a scrollbar appearing.
