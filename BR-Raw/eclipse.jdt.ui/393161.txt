Bug 393161 – [type wizards] Pre-fill package name in the new class dialog
If the new java class wizard is executed against a project and the project does not have any packages yet then the package field should be prefilled with the named of the project.
Reproduce.
Create an empty project
go to the source folder
select new class
the package field is empty and it requires a lot of work to fill it in with the name of the project, which should, by convention, be the name of the top level package.
