Bug 354766 – Javadoc content does not appear in content assist info window for non-static inner class constructors
Build Identifier: 20110615-0604
Bug 334652 missed fixing one spot -- the content-assist informational window does not display the javadoc, although the editor will be capable of doing so.
Hopefully this can find its way into 3.7.1 or 3.7.2 as it affects the usability of our commercial product; it makes it tricky for users to understand one of our API points, which method to call.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce, take the attachments from bug 334652 and simply add a new constructor, say:
/**
* javadoc for InnerFinalException(String property, Throwable cause)
* @param property the property argument
* @param cause the chained exception
*/
public InnerFinalException(String property, Throwable cause) {
}
then, you will notice that any call like
InnerFinalException e = new InnerFinalException([invoke-content-assist]
will display both constructors, but fail to display javadoc during the content
assist chooser.
