Bug 43364 – [typing] new line insertion sometimes goes wrong!
try and put a new line between the two variable declarations.
It will shift the
second variable declaration to line up with "c".
------------------------------------------------------------
public class A
{
private static final String[] var = new String[] { "a", "b",
"c", "d"};
private static final int var2 = 4; //press enter at beginning of this line
}
