Bug 458200 – [null] "Annotate" proposals for adding external null annotations to library classes
Sibling of bug 458186, but now we want to support adding annotations without any compile errors/warnings.
Rationale: by pointing to the library method in an editor when adding annotations, we can completely hide the attached external annotations.
