Bug 350347 – [reorg] Move text file to "default package" folder deletes the file with exception report
In package explorer, noticed that if you drag a java file from a package to the project, it lands instead in "default package".
Now try dragging a text file from main project folder to "default package".
Said text file is inexplicably deleted and an exception is thrown.
Expected behavior would be either the file is shown as part of the default package, or else we get a message about how that doesn't work, and in any event the file should not be deleted as a result of mere poking around in the interface.
PS: I am not using separate source and binary folders.
Don't know if this matters.
