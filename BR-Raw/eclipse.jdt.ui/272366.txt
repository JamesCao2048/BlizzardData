Bug 272366 – [ltk] LTK RefactoringWizardOpenOperation opens window with no window title text
If your wizard does not have any user input pages, but performs changes that have a preview, the preview window is opened automatically.
However, this preview window does not contain the text that was set using RefactoringWizard#setWindowTitle().
If a user page was specified, it does contain work.
