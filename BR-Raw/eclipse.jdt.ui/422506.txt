Bug 422506 – [1.8][render] Abstract method from interface should show "A" adornment

An abstract method from an interface should show an "A" adornment like an abstract method from a class.
AFAIK, we didn't add the "A" in the past, since the outline of an interface looks a bit "crowded" when every method has an "A".
However, the missing "A" is already problematic in other views like Search, Type Hierarchy, and in Quick Outline/Hierarchy, since the abstractness of a method cannot be seen without additional knowledge about the declaring type.
With static and default methods in interfaces, this got even worse, since those methods now identify themselves as having an implementation, but abstract methods still look like regular instance methods.
Does anybody disagree with this change or have a better solution?
