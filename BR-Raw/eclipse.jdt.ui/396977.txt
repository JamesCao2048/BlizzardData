Bug 396977 – [jar exporter] Wrong library order in manifest generating a jar file with "runnable JAR file" option
Created attachment 224946 [details]
Manifest and Build path
I'm trying to generate a runnable jar using Eclipse (Export->Java->Runnable JAR file).
The JAR is generated correctly but the classpath key generated in the manifest file of this jar don't respect the libraries order fixed on my Build Path configuration.
I have to change manually the manifest file because I need respect this order.
The Java BuildPath order in my Eclipse configuration is:
DynastyDM.jar dtgjxfsdevices.jar dsijxfs.jar jxfsclient2.1.3b.jar
The classpath key in the manifest file has the following value:
dtgjxfsdevices.jar jxfsclient2.1.3b.jar dsijxfs.jar DynastyDM.jar
Â¿What can I do for generating automatically the manifest file with the correct order?
Thanks
