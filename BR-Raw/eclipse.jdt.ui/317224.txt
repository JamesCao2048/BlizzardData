Bug 317224 – [refactoring] Fix enablement and precondition checking of Extract... refactorings for packages names and annotations
I20100608-0911
While looking at bug 303617, I found that we have a few bugs in enablement and precondition checking of Extract...
refactorings with certain selections.
E.g.
if you select a package name or an annotation, the refactorings are available in the quick menu and don't even stop in the initial condition checking.
Same problem for Extract Local and Extract Method for selections in an annotation's arguments.
