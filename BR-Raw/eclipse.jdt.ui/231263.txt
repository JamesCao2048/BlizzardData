Bug 231263 – [formatter] New JavaDoc formatter wrongly indent tags description
Created attachment 99431 [details]
Simple CU with big Javadoc
Build ID: I20080502-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Open some compilation unit, with many JavaDoc comments, formatted in 3.4M6;
2.
Format full compilation unit;
3.
Notice that look of JavaDoc comments is now very different.
More information:
I see following problems:
1.
for @param two tabs are used, but location of first "tab" is so that next tab position is just 1 character, so first "tab" looks as just space.
2.
Same problem for wrapping @return - single "tab", that looks as space.
3.
{@link ITypeBinding} can now be wrapped in the middle, so "{@link" stays on one line, and "ITypeBinding}" - on next line.
This saves some space, but hurts readability.
Now questions for these problems:
1.
May be add one more "space" after "* ", so first tab will be rendered as 4 spaces and provide enough indent?
2.
Same for @return - one more "space" after "* ".
3.
I'm not sure, may be space is more important, but may be make wrapping behavior configurable?
4.
In general, I find all these changes very annoying, because I have big codebase, formatted with old style, and use formatting as "Clean Up" step, so now I see massive changes in CVS in each compilation unit that I touch.
:-(
