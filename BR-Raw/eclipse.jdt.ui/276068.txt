Bug 276068 – [JUnit] JUnit viewer doesn't recognise <skipped/> node
Created attachment 135565 [details]
Example Junit xml report
Another JUnit 4 one.
If a JUnit4 test is annotated @Ignore, the resulting xml generated (e.g.
when running mvn test) contains <skipped/>
This causes an error when opening the file.
Try opening the attached with E3.5M7, and you'll get:
The test run could not be imported from file 'C:\Projects\workspace\abdera\adapters\filesystem\target\surefire-reports\TEST-org.apache.abdera.protocol.server.test.filesystem.FilesystemTest.xml'.
unknown node 'skipped'
