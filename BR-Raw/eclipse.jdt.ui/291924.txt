Bug 291924 – hashCode() and equals() break when extending abstract class

I have an abstract base class for database objects that specifies a few basic methods that all database objects need.
 To enforce that all objects override equals() and hashCode() I have made those methods abstract in the base class forcing the subclasses to implement them.
 However, the generate hashCode() and equals() tool makes calls to super.equals() and super.hashCode() which then fail to compile since they are abstract methods.
 These calls are not made if the hashCode() and equals() are not defined in the abstract super class.
 In short, equals() and hashCode() should not call super() if super() is abstract.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create abstract class with equals() and hashCode() as abstract methods
2.Extend abstract class
3.attempt to generate equals() and hashCode()
