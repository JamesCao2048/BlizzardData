Bug 332008 – [quick fix] Quick fix can be improved in 1.4/1.5 mixed projects

In the attached projects, there's an error in OSGIConsole.java about incorrect return type.
"client" uses 1.4 compliance and "api", 1.5 compliance.
The quick fix suggested is "change return type to T".
Exercising this quick fix immediately causes an error because the current project is in 1.4 compliance.
Perhaps, quick fix should not offer suggestions not relevant to a 1.4 project.
The suggestion can be changed to "change return type to T and change compliance to 1.5" or removed altogether.
