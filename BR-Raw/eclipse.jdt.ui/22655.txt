Bug 22655 – Types/Refresh adds two list entries for a new .java file [browsing]
I am working with Sun JAXB 1.0ea and JavaCC 2.1.
These two products generate
Java source code.
The batch files I run to use these tools, first delete the
Java source files in the target directory before re-generating the Java
sources.
When I change the input grammar to these products sufficently new files may be
produced.
To be precise, I can run the tool, which generates C1.java and
C2.java, change the input of the tool which now generates C1.java, C2.java, AND
C3.java.
After I run the tool, I then fo to Eclipse and do a Types/Refresh on the
package that contains the generated source.
The refresh finds the files and
compiles them nicely BUT there are now TWO entries in the list for "C3" (there
should be one of course).
WORKAROUND: Select a different package in the Packages pane and re-select the
package that has the generated source and C3 appears the correct amount of
times: once.
Thank you,
Gary Gregory
