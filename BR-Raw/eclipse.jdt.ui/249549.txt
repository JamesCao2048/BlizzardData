Bug 249549 – [quick fix] bad proposal for abstract modifier before constructors in abstract classes
Build ID: M20080911-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create a class like this:
abstract class Test {
public abstract Test();
}
of course this code is wrong.
But Eclipse proposes two quick fixes:
"Add body", which is correct
and
"Add 'abstract' modifier", which does not make any sense.
When using this one, the result is still wrong, but with two 'abstract' modifiers and the same quick fix proposals.
More information:
this bug is similar to #208655
