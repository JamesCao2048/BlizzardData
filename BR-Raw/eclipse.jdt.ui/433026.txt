Bug 433026 – [1.8][quick fix] Conversion to Lambda is not appearing when it should
Let say we have a piece of code containing an anonymous class:
Runnable runner = new Runnable() {
public void run() {
System.out.println("Hello runner!");
}
};
- Clicking anywhere in these lines
- Selecting all the lines
- selecting the first line
+ Quick Fix does not show the "Convert to lambda expression" fix.
This makes this conversion fix difficult to discover.
Ideally, we could have a warning associated to this Lambda conversion.
