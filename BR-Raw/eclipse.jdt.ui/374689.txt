Bug 374689 – [search] Difficult to Select Limit To options in Search dialog with keyboard
1.
Open the search dialog (Ctrl+H).
2.
Tab through the items until you reach the Limit To area (you mush search for either Type or Method).
3.
The "Match locations" is in a different grouping from the other radio buttons, so when selecting one of the first few options then tabbing forward leads to the selection being lost and Match locations being selected.
This makes it difficult to select any of the other options, though you could Shift+Tab backwards through the entire dialog after selecting a option, but that's not a very nice experience.
