Bug 211767 – [hovering] focus control in information controls not correct
N20071203-0010.
The following method don't do what's intended but instead check the keyboard focus for just one widget:
org.eclipse.jface.text.IInformationControl.isFocusControl()
org.eclipse.jface.text.IInformationControl.addFocusListener(FocusListener)
org.eclipse.jface.text.IInformationControl.removeFocusListener(FocusListener)
isFocusControl() has been fixed for N20071204-0010.
Patches need to be made for non-Text and non JDT UI code.
Focus listners should be based on shell activation.
