Bug 27462 – [startup] SearchPlugin is loaded when Java plug-in gets loaded
The Java UI plugin eagerly activates the Search plugin.
There are 2 reason:
1) ISearchPageScore adapter that is registered
2) fSearchResultViewEntryAdapterFactory
we should investigate whether we can reduce this plugin activation.
