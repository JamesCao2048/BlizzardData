Bug 266924 – [content assist] Broken for anonymous type proposals if there are chars after the caret
N20090302-2000, follow-up to bug 263037.
Content assist is broken if there are chars after the caret and the proposal is a constructor proposal that should create an anonymous type:
public static void main(String[] args) {
new RuntimeException();
}
Put caret after 'new Run', press Ctrl+Space.
Press Enter to chose Runnable().
=> Constructor is not inserted.
What's even worse than not inserting is that my caret is kidnapped and makes a big jump towards the end of the file -- loss of context.
