Bug 258072 – [quick fix] Dead code detection quick fix leaves behind the curly braces
The quick fix for the dead code detection removes the code as well as the condition, which works in case of only 'if' block but if an 'if-else ' block is used it leaves behind the curly braces with the valid code.
Try this simple test case:
if (false){
x= 1;
}else {
x= 0;
}
then click on remove in the quick fix.
It leaves this :
{
x= 0;
}
