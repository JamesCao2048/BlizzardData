Bug 271139 – [rename] button clipped in Rename dialog
20090401
In Eclipse,
select a java file,
refactor->rename
note the 4 buttons at bottom: back|next|cancel|finish
the right edge of next is cut off.
Kevin indicates that this can be a problem caused by JDT-UI (by using negative numbers for horizonal alignment).
