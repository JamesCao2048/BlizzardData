Bug 271228 – [encapsulate field] Encapsulate field on multi-variable declarations drops modifiers
Created attachment 130923 [details]
Patch for SelfEncapsulateFieldRefactoring
Build ID:  I20090313-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
To reproduce the bug apply the refactoring on field 'zip' in the following example:
public class Foo {
public volatile static int zip, zap;
}
More information:
The refactoring transforms the program into
...
public volatile static int zap;
private int zip;
public static void setZip(int zip) { ...}
public static int getZip() { ...
}
A correct transformation would declare field zip as
private volatile static int zip;
