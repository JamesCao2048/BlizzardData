Bug 424166 – [quick assist] Add key binding for Extract method Quick Assist
Cannot bind inplace (dialogless) extract method refactoring to keyboard shortcut, it is only available in quick fix menu.
This minor issue is, probably, an accidental omission, so quick fix action is not registered for key binding.
Could be fixed in a manner demonstrated by commit in my JDT fork
