Bug 243163 – [jar exporter] export directory entries in "Runnable JAR File"
Please add an option to "add directory entries" to the new "Runnable JAR File" export.
 This option already exists in the older "JAR File" export.
I ran into a problem where Jar-ing some existing projects with Ganymede caused getClass().getClassLoader().getResource( path ) to return null due to the fact that the empty directory entries had not been exported to the Jar.
