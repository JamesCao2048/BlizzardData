Bug 283427 – [refactoring] [api] RefactoringWizardOpenOperation/RefactoringWizard should have a way to use a specified IRunnableContext
I'm launching a Refactoring from within a project properties page.
I'm using the RefactoringWizardOpenOperation class to open the refactoring wizard.
It turns out that when using this class, it will create an internal RefactoringWizard/Dialog and load the refactoring in it.
During this time, the ApplicationWindow runnable context is used to report status while the wizard is being initialized.
This is bad, because there already is a Dialog open.
This has a few problems.
1) You can cancel the dialog, but the operation would still be running.
2) You can't cancel the operation since it is blocked by a modal dialog.
I wanted to fix this by creating a properties page that implements IRunnableContext with a progress monitor itself.
Properties pages are not a IRunnableContext, but it was relatively easy to make it so using ProgressMonitorPart.
(Except that cancelation is not supported)
It turns out even after I did the work to create a Properties page with a progress monitor, there was no way for me to pass in that IRunnableContext to the Wizard.
RefactoringWizard is hard coded to use PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow() as the IRunnableContext when calculating the user input pages.
(RefactoringWizard#getStartingPage()) Additionally, I can't override this method since it calls package-private and calls other private methods.
My request is to modify RefactoringWizardOpenOperation and RefactoringWizard to accept a IRunnableContext for execution.
