Bug 265448 – [inline] Inlining long constants may change semantics
If the variable "two" in the snippet below is inlined using "Refactor -> Inline...", the result will change from 2^32-2 to -2.
The 2 should be suffixed with 'L' when inlined.
This type of bug (in the code below, not the JDT bug) is quite tricky to spot.
long two = 2;
long much = two * Integer.MAX_VALUE;
