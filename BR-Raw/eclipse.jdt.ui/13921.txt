Bug 13921 – Desire per-project property settings for Ant integration
We have an Ant implementation which stores most properties in an
external .properties file.
 However, there is still a need to pass one or two
properties to Ant using the Ant wizard and -DPROPERTY=....
Our build files are set up in such a way that property values are unlikely to
change between any two build files in a given project.
 Thus it would be a nice
feature if Eclipse allowed a user to set default property values for a PROJECT,
which would then be in force for any build.xml file which is part of that
PROJECT.
 And as long as I'm asking for favors, an ideal implementation would
still allow the user to use the Ant wizard to override any of these default
values for any particular build.xml file, as desired.
