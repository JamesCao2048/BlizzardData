Bug 24271 – Source Folders: Sort Java Packages and Simple Folders Together
In Eclipse 1.0, packages and simple folders were not sorted together within the
Project (as the source folder).
 Packages were (sorted) and placed first,
followed by simple folders (that were also sorted).
In Eclipse 2.0, the packages and simple folders are sorted together within the
Project (as the source folder).
 Unfortunately, if you use Source Folders the
packages and source folders are sorted as described above in Eclipse 1.0.
It would be useful for packages and simple folders to be sorted together within
their Source Folder.
