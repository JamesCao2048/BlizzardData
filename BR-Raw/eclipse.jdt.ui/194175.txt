Bug 194175 – [search] Search result filters not persisted any more
N20070625-0010
- search for references to a Java class
=> search result has filter "In Imports" enabled by default
- disable filter "In Imports"
- search for references to another class
=> search result has filter "In Imports" enabled
=> expected: changed filter settings should apply to all Java searches (old and new ones)
