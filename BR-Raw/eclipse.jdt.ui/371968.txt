Bug 371968 – recommend option settings when enabling annotation-based null analysis
Bug 371940 demonstrates a situation where a user was surprised to not see a pot.null warning after enabling annotation-based null analysis.
My first reaction was that enabling null annotations could automatically trigger to strengthen some related problems.
Notably pot.null diagnostics could be changed to "warning" if previously ignored.
After reading Ayush's bug 371940 comment 5 I agree that a softer approach would be better:
Can enabling null annotations just trigger some kind of recommendation/suggestions?
"When enabling null annotations it is suggested to also enable the following warnings: ..."
(I'm thinking of Debian/Ubuntu, where a package may specify other packages suggested for install)
Could be a popup, could be an info in the dialog's status line or anything.
