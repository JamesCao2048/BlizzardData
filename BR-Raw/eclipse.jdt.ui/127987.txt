Bug 127987 – [hovering] BIDI: wrong ordering of Hebrew text in tooltip code window
1.
Create a java project and java class including main method.
2.
Type in the main method the following text: System.out.print("ABC" + DEF);
where capital are Hebrew characters.
2.
Folding the region the main method, i.e click on the minus icon in the vertical left side of the editor to collapse the code.
3.
Hovering over the folded Java element (on the â€œ+â€? icon).
Result: When peeking the hidden code the ordering is changed as following:
System.out.print("DEF + "ABC);
Expected result: The text in editor and text in code tooltip should be consistent.
