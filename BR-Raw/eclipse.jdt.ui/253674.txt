I20081030-1917
- smoke test setup
- open clean up wizard
- select the configured profile for the project
- Next
- Back
- select custom profile
- configure to only organize imports
- Next
=> AssertionFailedException below
Removing the assertion in AbstractCleanUp.java:47 removes the exception, but still does too much (e.g.
adds @Override).
