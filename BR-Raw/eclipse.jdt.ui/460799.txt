Bug 460799 – [compare] Structured compare editor tree doesn't properly format qualified types
The Java structured compare editor doesn't properly format qualified types that appear as type arguments.
Example: Compare the class below with a version that has no members.
The tree says that elements
Try
sd : Date>
foo(int, String>)
have been added/removed.
package xy;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Set;
class Try {
void foo(int i, ArrayList<java.lang.String> ls) {}
Set<java.util.Date> sd;
}
