Bug 232333 – Fix typo in CodeCompletionPerformanceTest.createTypeHierarchy()
R3.4.
There's a typo in the source of CodeCompletionPerformanceTest.createTypeHierarchy(): in
"    int" + field + ";\n" +
should be a space after int:
"    int " + field + ";\n" +
IMPORTANT: this change must be backported to perf34x branch.
