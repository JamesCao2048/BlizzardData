Bug 416401 – [preferences] Incorrect enablement of 'Inline finally blocks' preference option
Found that 'Inline finally blocks' option is enabled incorrectly:
1.
In the compiler preference page, select 'Configure Project Specific Settings' and choose a Java 1.4 project.
Select the 'Java Build Path' and modify the EE to J2SE-1.5.
Use the back button or directly click on the Java Compiler to come back to the previous page where the project specific setting was being modified.
See that the 'Inline finally blocks' is enabled for Java-1.5, which is wrong.
2.
In the compiler preference page, select 1.4 compliance level.
Now uncheck 'Inline finally blocks' option.
Now change the compliance level to 1.5 and then change to 1.6 and now change it back to 1.4, the checkbox is now checked.
This also looks wrong.
