Bug 82839 – [misc] Breakpoint icons disappear
I am using 3.1M4
1 - Open a file and set a breakpoint.
The breakpoint icon appears in the left
and right margins.
2 - Close the file.
3 - Open the same file.
Note the breakpoint icons no longer appear.
The
breakpoint is still there but the icons don't appear and you can't select them.
This is a major problem because I can't see the breakpoints I've previously set
so I have to clear those breakpoints and set new ones each time I run a debug
session.
