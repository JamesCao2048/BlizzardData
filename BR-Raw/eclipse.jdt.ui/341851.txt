Bug 341851 – [rename] Refactoring (renaming) gives "already exists" error for upper/lower case change
Build Identifier: M20100909-0800
When I try to rename my project from "project1" to "Project1" using rightclick->refactor->rename, I get the error "A folder with that name already exists".
I have to first change it to something else like "proj1" and then back to "Project1".
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create new java project name "project1"
2.
Refactor the project name to "Project1"
3.
Will see the error in the dialogue box not letting you continue.
