Bug 368390 – [preferences] UI for null analysis for fields
This bug can be used for the discussion and work around the new UI preferences related to the work in bug 247564.
The current proposal is as follows:
Only one additional option will be surfaced in the UI
[  ] Include fields in null analysis
Each null analysis related warning viz.
null pointer access, pot.
NPA, redundant null check, redundant assignment, etc.
in the case of fields will respect the existing settings for these options.
