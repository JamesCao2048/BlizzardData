Bug 32412 – [ccp] Get progress monitor before rename prompt when copy/pasting file
build I20030220
- in package explorer,
- select a CU
- Ctrl+C
- Ctrl+V
- you get a progress dialog, then another dialog prompting you to choose a
different name
Should get the new name dialog first, then only show the progress monitor if
the first dialog is not canceled.
