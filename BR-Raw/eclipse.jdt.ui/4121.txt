Bug 4121 – JarExporter causes out of Sync (1GILQD5)
PA (8/17/01 2:03:29 PM)
if you export a directory (project) and place the exported jar in the same directory (project) then
you will get an out of sync message when you overwrite the exported jar-file the 2nd time.
-> maybe the exported jar file should not include itself ?
