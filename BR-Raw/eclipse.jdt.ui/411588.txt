Bug 411588 – "Convert for loops to enhanced" may mess up program logic when dealing with Iterable
With the save action "Convert 'for' loops to enhanced 'for' loops" enabled,
the conversion to enhanced loop might introduce a logical error.
Lets suppose you have an object "s" with a class implementing java.lang.Iterable and this class has also another method named "iterator", also with an "Iterator" return type, BUT with a __non empty signature__.
for (Iterator<Object> it = s.iterator(42) ; it.hasNext(); ) {
Object obj = it.next();
// ...
}
The save action will convert it to an enhanced loop assuming the use of "s.iterator()" instead of "s.iterator(42)" !
for (Object obj : s) {
// ...
}
(The bug exists also in 3.7.2 and probably in all releases until Kepler)
