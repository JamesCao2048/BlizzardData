Bug 267358 – [package explorer][working sets][dnd] When sorted, should not show drop target for WS
I20090304-0834
When the Package Explorer shows working sets and sorting is enabled, rearranging them via drag and drop makes no sense.
The drop targets before and after working sets should be inactive then (but DND of an element into another WS should still work).
