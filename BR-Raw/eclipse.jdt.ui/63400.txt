Bug 63400 – elements not removed from hierarchical search
20040520
Ensure that you are use the hierarchical presentation for search.
1.
Do a search with several hits: references to toString, or JavaCore, or ...
2.
Remove one of the leaf elements from the list (one method or type).
 The
count of search items decreases, however, the view is not updated.
When I remove the last element from the package, the entire package is removed
(but not before)
