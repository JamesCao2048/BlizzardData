Bug 30412 – ClassCastException selecting package in java browsing perspective
Build: I20030122
I have the java browsing perspective open.
 I selected a package in the packages
view, and there was an error trying to open the type browsing view.
 I can't
seem to reproduce it, but hopefully the stack trace will be useful.
 The result
was that the types view could not be initialized (the view contained an error
message saying it could not be created.
