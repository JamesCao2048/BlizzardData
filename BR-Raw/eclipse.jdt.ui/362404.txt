Bug 362404 – [1.7][preferences] new warning for missing try-with-resources is in wrong category
The "Resource not managed via try-with-resource" option is in the wrong category in the UI.
The compiler problem is in the CategorizedProblem#CAT_CODE_STYLE category, so we should also show the option in the corresponding UI section (Code style, not Potential programming problem).
