Bug 406274 – [1.8][extract interface] Invoking 'Extract Interface' on an interface with default method results in losing the default method implementation.
Consider the below interface
package p1;
public interface I1 {
default int defaultMethod(){
return 10;
}
}
Invoke 'Refactor-> Extract Interface...' on I1.
Select #defaultMethod to be part of the new interface.
Click 'OK' button.
In the newly created interface the method is created as abstract and in the original interface the method is removed.
So basically the method implementation is lost after refactoring.
