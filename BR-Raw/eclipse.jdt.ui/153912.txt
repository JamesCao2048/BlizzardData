Bug 153912 – [common navigator] Java model hiding parent folders in sync view
Build: I20060815-0800
I have a simple (non-Java) project in my workspace like this:
eclipse
platform-text
3.3
plan.html
When there is an incoming change on plan.html, the synch view looks like this when "All Models" is selected:
eclipse
3.3
plan.html
I.e., the "platform-text" parent folder is being filtered out.
 If the "Java Workspace" model is disabled, the problem goes away.
