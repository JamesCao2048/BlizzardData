Bug 247433 – [content assist] Add threshold support in code completion
I20080915-1800
To help solve performance problems that prevent to fix bug such as bug 6930, we should add some threshold support in code completion.
This threshold support would guaranty that code completion returns in a reasonable amount of time.
This threshold could be either a timeout, or a maximum number of potential matches (coming from the indexes) that need to be resolved.
If code completion reaches this threshold, it would just give up and indicate to the client that not all proposals were returned.
