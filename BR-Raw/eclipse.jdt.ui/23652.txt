Bug 23652 – Refactor Move doesn't handle inner classes correctly [refactoring]
After moving the class com.objfac.xmleditor.XMLValidator to the package
com.objfac.xmleditor.actions, a referencing class was left with the following
import statements:
import com.objfac.xmleditor.XMLValidator.ErrorCallback;
import com.objfac.xmleditor.XMLValidator.LocatorInfo;
import com.objfac.xmleditor.actions.XMLValidator;
The class itself is correctly named, but its two inner classes are not.
(All of
these imports were originally added by Organize Imports.)
