Bug 81172 – [spell checking][preferences] Spell checking only works if 'report problems as you type' is enabled
3.1 M4
I've always disabled the Java editor preference to report problems as I type.
After enabling spell checking, the java editor doesn't show spell checking
problems unless this preference is enabled.
I would like to use spell checking
without having to enable this preference.
