Bug 315772 – [preferences] Better UI to find preferences on Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings
I always have a difficult time finding the correct preference on this page - scrolling and twisties are painful.
(Plus we do not have mnemonics for all the preferences - I don't care for mnemonics too much but someone else might)
Possible solutions:
1.
Sub pages for each category
- Preferences in each category (except potential programming problems) fit in one screen, hence (almost) no scrolling required.
- Lesser mouse clicks - Opening and closing a twistie is 2 mouse clicks, selecting a sub page would be only one mouse click
Pros
- Simple to implement!
Cons
- Names of 3 categories are longer than 2 words, hence the subpages names in the tree will not look too good.
- You still have to know the category to find the preference quickly - and except for very frequently used preferences this will not be true.
2.
Create a filter box in this page
- This might be useful in other preference pages as well?
3.
Use the existing filter box on the left side to reveal and highlight individual preferences.
- I do not know how easy or difficult it is going to be with existing UI
4.
Mozilla provides Power User preference management where you can filter by single pref.
Maybe we can add a node 'All' at the bottom of the tree in left pane, which just lists all the preferences available in a filterable table containing 3 columns - key, type, default value?, value.
- A command can be added to directly go to this 'All' page
- This 'All' page is something similar to what is suggested for Properties View on http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/UI_Best_Practices_v3.x#Properties_View.
My favorite is option 4, but would settle for Option 2 as well.
