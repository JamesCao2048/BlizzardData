If I hover over a marker annotation, wait for the popup to appear (which is miniscule to begin with), and then hit F2, I am presented with an equally miniscule popup dialog.
The control doesn't even have a scrollbar for me to use the scrollwheel on, so I am forced to click inside and hit the down key or use my mouse to select text downwards to scroll.
