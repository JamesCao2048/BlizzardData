Bug 364815 – [preferences] UI for new preferences regarding annotation based null analysis
As bug 186342 is converging towards release, now would be a good time
to make the new configuration options available in the UI.
Please see the new preference constants in JavaCore inside attachment 207270 [details]
Basically we'd need:
[x] Enable annotation based null analysis
FQN of the annotation type to be used for marking nullable types _____
FQN of the annotation type to be used for marking non-null types _____
FQN of the annotation type to be used for making non-null the default ____
[x] Globally make non-null the default
Reporting:
Violation of null specification [Error/Warning/Ignore]
Violation of null specifications with potential null value [Error/Warning/Ignore]
Insufficient information for analysing adherence to null specifications [Error/Warning/Ignore]
Redundant null annotations  [Error/Warning/Ignore]
Obviously all these preferences depend on the first ("Enable ...").
Please consider the wording just as initial drafts.
Let me know if anything is unclear.
