Bug 357997 – [type hierarchy] Type Hierarchy View has button bar painting issues on workspace startup
Build Identifier: 20110615-0604
My workspace has type hierarchy active on my Workspace on startup.
 I believe that View is responsible for leaving an unpainted, gray modeless floating rectangle over or under other parts of UI.
If I horizontally expand and collapse the column that the type hierarchy is in, I can get the rectangle to be clearly visible.
 If I collapse the column enough, I can get the rectangle to disappear, and briefly I catch that the rectangle is actually the Type Hierarchy button bar, just unpainted.
 (The buttons appear for one frame before the bar disappears.)  While the button bar is unpainted, it does not respond to mouse clicks or drags.
The button bar I am referring to contains the "Show the Type Hierarchy", "Show the Supertype Hierarchy", "Show the Subtype Hierarchy", and "Previous Type Hierarchies" buttons.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Start Eclipse
2.
Expand/collapse the Type Hierarchy view horizontally
3.
View the modeless rectangle occlude other parts of the UI
