Bug 395071 – [typing] "Automatically close {Braces}" should not put the } after the rest of the line
I20121120-0800
public class Try {
public static void main(String[] args) {
main(new String[] { "abc", "def",| );
} // end of main
}
When I replace | with the caret and then press the return key, the result is:
public class Try {
public static void main(String[] args) {
main(new String[] { "abc", "def",
);
}
} // end of main
}
Expected:
public class Try {
public static void main(String[] args) {
main(new String[] { "abc", "def",
|
});
} // end of main
}
=> "Automatically close {Braces}" should not put the } after the rest of the current line.
It works fine as long as the array initializer only contains at most one argument.
Maybe related to bug 254704.
In some situations, the behavior is not completely predictable.
When I have
main(new String[] { "abc",|
, then the } is sometimes correct and sometimes at the bad position after the );.
