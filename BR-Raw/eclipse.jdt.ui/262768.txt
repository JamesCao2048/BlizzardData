Bug 262768 – [jar exporter] Jardesc for normal Jar contains <fatjar builder="...
I20090127-2000
The *.jardesc generated from the normal JAR file exporter contains this line:
<fatjar builder="org.eclipse.jdt.ui.plain_jar_builder" launchConfig=""/>
I don't see the benefit of this, especially since the Runnable JAR exporter does not support .jardesc files.
