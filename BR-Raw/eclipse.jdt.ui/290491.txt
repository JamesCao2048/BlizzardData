Bug 290491 – [preferences] EE/JRE vs. compiler compliance inconsistency should be better visible
R3.5.
We show a message at the bottom of the 'Java Compiler' page if the JRE/EE doesn't fit well together with the compiler compliance.
Unfortunately this can easily be overseen.
We should either show a warning icon along with a small text pointing to the longer version at the bottom or put a warning icon in front of the current message.
The latter might be a better solution.
