Bug 21926 – [templates][preferences] Can't trigger templates beginning with non-JavaIdentifierStart
I entered the following template into the Java Templates preferences page:
name = $NON-NLS-1$
desc = insert $NON-NLS-1$
body = $$NON-NLS-1$$
Although the template page allowed me to enter this template, I could find no
way to trigger its insertion.
If I typed '$N' and hit Ctrl+Space, it was not
offered as a possible completion.
I think that there are two problems here:
1) $ is a valid Java identifier char.
It should be permitted in template names.
2) The template page should not allow me to name a template in such a way that
it cannot be triggered
