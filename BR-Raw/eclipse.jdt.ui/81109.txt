Bug 81109 – [nls tooling] Improve Properties file key navigation dialog for multiple references
200412142000:
- The description of the open dialog could be more specific, e.g.
replace
element by file
- The entries in the open dialog are to wide, causing scrollbars to be shown
initially.
A simple tree view like in ElementTreeSelectionDialog would do the
trick, not giving up the option to type in the item to be opened
- Several matches in the same file should be indicated as in the search result
view (file name + # of matches in parentheses)
- The offset/length indication is useless: The length is the same anyway, and
the offset cannot be easily used to differentiate between the results.
A five-
lines-high preview of the location would help, or a popup similar as the
additional info popup for content assist proposals.
