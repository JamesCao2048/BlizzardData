Bug 154851 – [reorg][move static members] Move constant wizard has option "Keep original method..."
I20060822-1200
Refactor > Move a constant field.
The wizard has an option "Keep original method as delegate to moved method".
-> Should be "member", not "method"
-> Same problem when moving two constants at once
