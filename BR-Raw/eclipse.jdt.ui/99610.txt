Bug 99610 – [api] add API to file buffers that allows to specify whether a file is internal or external
3.1 RC2
The current file buffer API accepts internal file paths and external file
locations to get a file buffer.
This can impact performance (see bug 91508).
In
most cases clients know up-front whether the given path points to an external or
an internal file.
We should allow to pass this information via API.
