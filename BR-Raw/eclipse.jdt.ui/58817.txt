Bug 58817 – UI no longer responsive when sorting search matches
Build 20040413
I searched for references to type: java.lang.System in org.eclipse.jdt.core
project.
This found over 4000 matches.
I attempted to sort them by parent name, and my IDE locked for about 5 minutes
to do the work, with no progress indication, no refresh and 100% CPU usage.
Clearly something to improve on UI responsiveness front.
