Bug 296998 – Unused imports should not prevent execution
Given this class:
import java.util.List;
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello");
}
}
compile like:
$ ecj -proceedOnError -err:+unused Test.java
and execute:
$ java Test
gives
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:
at Test.main(Test.java:4)
Normally, the eclipse compiler does a good job in producing usable code
even in the presence of errors.
In this simple case it fails to do so.
This is because an unused import is flagged against the CompilationUnitScope.
In that case generateCode assumes that all code within this CU is useless.
An immediate soluation would be to make ImportReference extend
ReferenceContext and let ProblemReporter.unusedImport(ImportReference)
set the import reference as the reference context.
This should then be applied to other errors against imports, too.
As an alternative trying to generate code for a CUD with errors is
probably not a good option.
