Bug 141492 – 'Copy Fully Qualified Name' could copy full path for resources
I20060512-0010
Sometimes I need to paste the full path of a resource (e.g.
into a bug report).
'Copy Fully Qualified Name' which is currently disabled for resources could do that task.
Maybe we could even switch the label (e.g.
'Copy Full Path' for resources).
