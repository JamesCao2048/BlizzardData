Bug 262050 – Unclear directions in New Java Project wizard
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
File->New->Java Project.
2.
In the first panel, in the frame entitled "Contents", the option "Create project from existing source" should be renamed to "Create project files in specific directory."
More information:
I am suggesting this change because the new text more closely matches the function of this item: the project files are put in the selected directory, and code can be linked in from any location regardless of where the project files are.
 You are not actually bound to put the source in the same directory as the project files.
