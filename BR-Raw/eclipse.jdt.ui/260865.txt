Bug 260865 – [compare] Clicking on the structure view breaks the compare editor viewers
Build id: N20090110-2000
Steps:
1) Create a java project and two classes inside (A.java and B.java).
They can be very simple, e.g.
public class A {
// class A
}
2) Compare them using Compare With > Each Other
3) In the compare editor, change something in A.java, e.g.
// comment
public class A {
// class A
}
4) Double click on a node in the structure view
5) Notice that the content of the viewer with A.java changed to
// comment
public class A {
//
6) Save, still the content is wrong
7) Open A.java in the java editor, it looks ok
