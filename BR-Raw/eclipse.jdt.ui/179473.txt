Bug 179473 – [rename] Rename in Editor should enter linked mode if identifier cannot be resolved
N20070327-0010
'Refactor > Rename' in 'Rename in Editor' mode should enter linked mode if the selected identifier cannot be resolved.
This is the last advantage of the 'Rename In File' quick assist over the in-place rename refactoring.
E.g.
Alt+Shift+R should link the two unresolved 'argument' references (but not show the refactoring popup at all):
public class Try {
void m(String arg) {
System.out.println(argument + argument);
}
}
Currently, we show a dialog that the element could not be resolved.
Martin, do you agree?
