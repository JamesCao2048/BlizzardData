Bug 391389 – [ltk] Rename refactoring should give more control over new file name
When using rename resource refactoring via resource rename dialog (see RenameResourceProcessor and RenameResourceWizard classes) my users frequently fail to keep the file extension.
For example they rename "Screen1.screen" to "Screen2" which breaks things down the way.
I'd like to have a say over the file name.
Ideally it should be possible to append the required extension automatically.
Another option would be to allow custom validations of the file name.
If none of the above is possible then at least pre-select the file-name part (before the dot) the way Gnome does.
This makes changing the name and leaving the extension in place a little easier.
My current fix is to make check this condition in checkConditions method in my rename participant.
However this is not ideal because the error is only shown on the next page and user has to return to fix the problem.
