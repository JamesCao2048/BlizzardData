Bug 439912 – [1.8][quick assist] Add quick assists to add and remove parentheses around single lambda parameter
This is probably not one of the most important features, but when I have:
int i = (1 + 2);
And when I put the cursor here:
int i = (1 + 2);
^       ^
Then I can hit Ctrl+1 and there's an option to "Remove extra parentheses".
This is not the case with a lambda expression where the same should be possible as well:
Consumer<Integer> c = (i) -> {}
Similarly, there should be a quick fix to add such parentheses
Consumer<Integer> c = i -> {}
