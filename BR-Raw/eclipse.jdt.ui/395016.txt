Bug 395016 – [introduce factory] Introduce Factory on an abstract class adds a statement to create an instance of that class
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Invoke "Introduce Factory" on the constructor in code below
2.
The resulting code does not compile
abstract class IntroduceFactoryBug1 {
// Invoke "Introduce Factory" on the constructor
IntroduceFactoryBug1() {
}
}
