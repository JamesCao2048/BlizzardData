Bug 58098 – Smart cursor positioning in java names don't work for CONSTANT_NAMES
Smart cursor positioning in java names don't work for CONSTANT_NAMES both when
moving and deleting (Ctrl+Delete).
I assume it should as CONSTANT_NAMES are
equally part of a Java naming standard just as methodNames() are.
In case it
works as designed then option name should be changed to accurately describe its
actual function.
