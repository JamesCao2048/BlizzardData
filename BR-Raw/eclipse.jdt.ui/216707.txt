Bug 216707 – [compare] Toggle comment causes noisy diff in Compare editor
Created attachment 87979 [details]
A screenshot of the cluttered diff
Build ID: I20071213-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Toggle the comment of a block of code
2.
Compare the two versions
More information:
The diff-view is cluttered with a lot of "different" braces and some "changed" constants whose name includes an underscore.
Expected:
Since not a even the spaces/tabs are changed, the only thing to highlight in gray are the comment-markers // on each line.
