Bug 296878 – [quick fix] Quick fix that adds exception doesn't check if @throws javadoc element exists

If a piece of code that throws an exception not declared in the throws clause is quick-fixed, it adds the exception to the throws clause, and also adds an entry to the javadoc.
If the javadoc already has a @throws element for that exception, it adds a second, useless one.
Reproducible: Always
