Note: Steps may not be exact.
1.
Open the 'Package Explorer' view.
2.
View menu > Top Level Elements > Working Sets
3.
View menu > Configure Working Sets...
> Create one if you don't have one already.
4.
Select a project.
5.
Context menu > Assign Working Sets...
6.
Observe the odd configuration option at the bottom of the dialog.
My main issues with the text at the bottom is the odd placement of the link and the fact that it is a capitalized word.
It feels like this is all one sentence but that isn't actually the case.
