Bug 361559 – [ltk] DeleteArguments misses API getDeleteProjectContents()
master
DeleteArguments misses the API below.
Without that, participants can't know whether contents will be deleted or not.
/**
* Returns whether projects contents will be deleted as well.
This method
* is not applicable for file and folder deletions.
*
* @return <code>true</code> if the refactoring will delete the project
*         contents, <code>false</code> if it only removes the reference
*         from the workspace
*/
public boolean getDeleteProjectContents() {
return fDeleteProjectContents;
}
