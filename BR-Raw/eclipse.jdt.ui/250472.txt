Bug 250472 – [preferences] Add preference for new compiler warning: MissingHashCodeMethod
3.5
For bug 38751, some UI work is needed to surface the new warning.
fyi:
Added a new compiler warning to report a missing hashCode() method when overriding the equals() method from Object.
This diagnosis is controlled by option:
JavaCore.COMPILER_PB_MISSING_HASHCODE_METHOD and produces a problem marker which ID is
IProblem.MissingHashCodeMethod problem ID.
Compiler option ID: Reporting Missing HashCode Method.
When enabled, the compiler will issue an error or a warning if a type
overrides Object.equals(Object) but does not override hashCode().
Option id: "org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.missingHashCodeMethod"
Possible values: { "error", "warning", "ignore" }
Default: "ignore"
This should appear in Potential Programming Problems section.
