Bug 298603 – [JUnit] Add a filter for ignored tests
Build Identifier: M20090917-0800
The JUnit view has a filter to show only failures.
It would be nice to have an additional filter (toolbar and menu) that shows only the ignored tests.
Otherwise it is very hard to find the ignored tests in a large test suite.
Reproducible: Always
