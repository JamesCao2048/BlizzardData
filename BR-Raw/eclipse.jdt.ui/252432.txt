Bug 252432 – [render] Use the new API from JDT/Core to provide a better display of the referenced jars
When jar are referenced in the Class-Path: clause of the MANIFEST.MF file, they end up being displayed with the name of the jar that referenced them.
This is far from being ideal as it is difficult to distinguish them.
