Bug 426963 – [pull up] Import declaration for the type use annotation is missing after pull up refactoring
Consider the code snippet:
import org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull;
public class Square implements Shape {
public Integer getArea(@NonNull Integer length) {
return new Integer(length * length);
}
}
Refactor "Pull Up" the method to "Shape", the resulting file does not contain the import declaration for @NonNull and hence the user ends up with compilation errors.
