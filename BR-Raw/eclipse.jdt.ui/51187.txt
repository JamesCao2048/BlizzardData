Bug 51187 – [content assist] should filter setters for final fields
Many classes have constants defined as public static final or protected
staticd final with name in all caps.
You don't really need getter and setter
(since it is final) for the constants.
They should not be displayed by default
when you go to Generate getter and setter dialog since they are taking real
esteate and make it difficult to find real class attributes.
