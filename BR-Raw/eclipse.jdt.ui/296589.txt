Bug 296589 – [breadcrumb] Opening a file via breadcrumb does not retarget the status line
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; GTB0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I choose a class via the breadcrumb, the line numbers at the bottom of the screen do not update themselves.
In addition, Source -> Clean Up fails to work until I've fixed the problem.
The only way for the line numbers to update themselves again (and for Source -> Clean Up) is for me to select a document not using breadcrumbs and go back to my document.
Another way is to control+pageup and control+pagedown to get back to where I'm at.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.I'm in the Java Perspective.
My breadcrumb bar looks like the following:
ncoserver-business-cbservices -> src/main/java -> com.ncogroup.ncoserver.business.service -> NcoDeceasedService
2.
I observe the line number at the bottom of the screen.
It reflects the current file I'm in, for this example line 10 of NcoDeceasedService.java.
3.
I click on the 4th item in the breadcrumb to choose another file.
For this example, I choose NcoDependentService.
4.
The cursor focus moves to line 3 and hilites the class name.
The bottom of the screen still shows that I'm on line number 10 of the previous file.
5.
When I move the cursor around the screen via keyboard or mouse, the line number does not update.
