Bug 251327 – [browsing] JavaBrowsingPart not clearing fPreveiousSelectionProvider
Build ID: M20080911-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Open two editors - one must be an ITextEditor (any java file) and the other must not be (extend EditorPart directly and only implement ISelectionProvider)
2.
Place a break point in JavaBrowsingPart.selectionChanged(IWorkbenchPart, ISelection)
2.
Switch between the two editors in the java browsing perspective (so you can see the packages).
3.
When you select the ITextEditor it shows the editor's package, when you select the non-ITextEditor it checks line 718 and determines that the same part last fired the selection event because when the ITextEditor's selection event is processed it doesn't set fPreviousSelectionProvider.
More information:
A simple fix would seem to be to set the fPreviousSelectionProvider in a finally block with the contents of selectionChanged inside the try portion.
 It would be nice if this could make it into the next release as it really makes custom displays a pain to integrate.
