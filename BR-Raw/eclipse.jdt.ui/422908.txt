Bug 422908 – [organize imports] Add 'Skip' to Organize Import dialog
Add to Organize Import dialog dialog the skip button which will preserve wrong import.
Now the Organize Import dialog ask for each type that it can't resolve automatically and I must select the type or cancel the WHOLE operation.
Sometime I prefer to resolve it manually after import organisation, realy.
