Bug 311603 – [build path] editing user library properties drops classpath entry attributes
In the Java Persistence properties for a JPA project choose the JPA implementation type of User Library and select an appropriate library.
 Close and save the project properties.
 Right click on the library in the Project Explorer and choose 'Properties'.
 Select 'User Libraries...' and add/remove a jar from the user library.
 It can be any jar, doesn't have to be one that is needed for this library to be valid for the particular JPA platform.
 Now go back to the Project properties and view the Java Persistence page and you will see that the library has been unselected and there is an error.
I can only get this to happen if I edit the library as described above.
 If you instead edit it through the Project properties 'Java Build Path' page, the JPA implementation library never gets unselected.
