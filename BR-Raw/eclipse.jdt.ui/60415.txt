Bug 60415 – Should remove Search extension page
I20040428
We should remove the search extension page and should make sure that
participants can't damage a search.
If a participant generates an exception
the participant should be disabled for the rest of the Eclipse sessions.
This
is consistent with Platform/UI and refactoring.
