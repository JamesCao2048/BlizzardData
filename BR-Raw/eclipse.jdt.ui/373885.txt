Bug 373885 – [jar exporter] save runnable jar export as ant script with relative name saves in eclipse program folder not workspace
Build Identifier: Version: Indigo Service Release 2 Build id: 20120216-1857
When saving settings for producing a runnable jar file as an ant script, if you enter a relative filename in the filename box, a message appears suggesting that this will be relative to the workspace root.
 However, when the file is actually saved, it is saved relative to the directory eclipse is installed in.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
export > runnable jar file
2.
check 'save as ant script'
3.
enter a relative path (e.g.
'myproject/exportjar.xml') in the filename box
4.
click finish
the file is not produced in the myproject directory of the workspace, but in a new subdirectory of the eclipse program directory.
