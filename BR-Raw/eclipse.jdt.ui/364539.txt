Bug 364539 – [generate constructor] Generate constructor using fields globally sets access modifier to private
Build Identifier: 20110916-0149
When using 'Generate Constructor using fields...' on an enum with private field the access modifier is disabled and set to private (which is perfectly ok).
Afterwards the access modifier is always set to private, even if you use 'Generate Constructor using fields...' on a class.
Eclipse should not remember the private access modifier when it is given and disabled.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create an Enum
2.
Create a private field
3.
Use 'Generate Constructor using fields...' to create the constructor
4.
Create a class
5.
Create a private field
6.
Use 'Generate Constructor using fields...' to create the constructor -> the access modifier is now set to private regardless of the previous setting
