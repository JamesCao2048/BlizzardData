Bug 303617 – [extract constant] Refactoring not available on pop-up if selected string is an annotation
Build Identifier: 3.5.1
If I select a string that is the value for an annotation, "Extract constant..." is available on the Refactor menu, but not on the Shift-Alt-T quick menu.
This is inconsistent, as it is on that menu for string constants outside of annotations.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Select a string constant within  @Annotation("string constant")
2.
Press Shift-Alt-T
3.
Menu item is not available
