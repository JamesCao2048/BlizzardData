Bug 264504 – [misc] Editor should not create working copy for deleted resource
Build ID: I20090129-1800
To Reproduce:
1) Create a class A
2) Close the editor, reveal class A in the package explorer
3) Start the rename refactoring for class A via the package explorer's context menu, name it B
4) go back to the last edit location using alt-left
observe: there is an editor opened for file A which does not exist anymore.
observe: the package explorer now shows a resource A alongside with B, even though it does not exist.
Trying to open the file results in an error.
5) keep the editor for the non-existant file A open
6) in the package explorer, start the rename refactoring again, rename the class A again
observe: no error is shown
observe: the editor for the non-existant file A becomes dirty.
observe: the class B still exists and is not touched at all
observe: all references to B in other files are change to A, leading to compile errors
