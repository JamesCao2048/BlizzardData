Bug 403924 – [1.8] Replace usages of MethodDeclaration#thrownExceptions() in the AST
Replace usages of MethodDeclaration#thrownExceptions() in the AST.
For jsr308, MethodDeclaration's thrownExceptions property has been replaced with thrownExceptionTypes.
Make a pass over all JDT UI code that uses the old property in any way (direct access or via property descriptor) and update usages.
File separate bugs if things get too complicated somewhere or if you think we should add new features for handling these constructs.
