Bug 316627 – [refactoring] Refactoring does not give warning about modifying derived resources
Build Identifier: M20100211-1343
The first time I try to edit a derived resource, Eclipse gives a warning about the resource being derived.
However, when some refactoring would change that same resource, no warning is issued.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Generate some Java classes with some tool like ANTLR
2.
Mark the generated sources as derived
3.
Create a normal class that refers to one of the generated classes
4.
Rename the generated class by changing its name in the class that refers it
5.
Eclipse will complete the refactor without any warning, but once you regenerate your ANTLR code, you will have compile errors
