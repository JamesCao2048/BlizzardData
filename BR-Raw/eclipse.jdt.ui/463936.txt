Bug 463936 – ExternalAnnotationsAttachmentDialog should not allow virtual folders
In bug 462768 I noticed that a virtual folder is not a good match for annotationpath, because internally we need a resolved file system path, in order to work with java.io.File.
Since a virtual folder answers null to getLocation(), we should report an error when a user tries to configure a virtual folder as an annotationpath.
This doesn't affected non-virtual *linked* resources, though.
