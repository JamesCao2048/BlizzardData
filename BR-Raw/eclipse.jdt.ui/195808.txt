Bug 195808 – [projection] ProjectionViewer: Toggling between segmented and projection mode can fail
When the ProjectionViewer is toggling from projection mode to segmented mode in setVisibleRegion(), the projection mode is saved in the field fWasProjectionEnabled, but only if isSegmented() returns false.
If there is a folded region at the start or end of the document, isSegmented() will return true, the projection mode will not be saved and will therefore not be restored in resetVisibleRegion().
I think isSegmented() is not implemented correctly.
It should never return true in projection mode.
This causes problems with the CDT editor (see bug 193739 comment 1).
