Bug 338229 – [typing] Incorrect indentation in string continuation (press Enter in front of +)
HEAD (same problem with and without fix for bug 337150), was OK in 3.6.1
- paste this snippet into a project with default formatter settings:
package xy;
public class Try {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Some"
+ new Object()
+ "string:\n" + definedType.toString());
}
}
- Select All
- Correct Indentation
=> indentation looks good
- put caret before last +
- press Enter
=> last code line is indented too much (2 tabs):
+ "string:\n"
+ definedType.toString());
