Bug 460997 – [hovering] Report fallback mode in Javadoc view / hover when SWT Browser widget is not available
Bug 456786 comment 0 tells that it's hard for users to find the real issue when Javadoc view and hovers only have degraded functionality because the Browser widget couldn't be created.
Bug 73558 tried to convey this information in a dialog, but that was too intrusive.
A middle way is to show it at the end of the view or enriched hover.
