Bug 383491 – Unable to reference a virtual folder as Java source attachment path
Build Identifier: Version: 4.2.0 Build id: I20120531-1500
I'm building a plugin for a Java application.
The source code and classes for my plugin all reside within an eclipse project workspace.
However, the application jar and its source code are maintained outside of the eclipse workspace and the application jar is produced by another build mechanism.
 I have referenced the application jar file in my project using drag and drop and the 'Link to files' option specifying it 'Create link locations relative to: MYDEV', where MYDEV is a Linked Resource Variable I have created for each Eclipse installation.
This lets me use the same eclipse project on multiple machines where the path to the application jar varies, but is always the same relative to MYDEV.
However, I cannot associate the application source code with this jar unless I use an absolute path.
If I include a reference to MYDEV in the Path for Workspace location or External location, the Properties dialogue will not accept the path and gives a 'The path XXX does not exist' error.
The work around is to use absolute paths for the source location.
 However, this is a problem when the same project is used on different machines where the path to the external source is not the same.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create a new Java Project
2.
Drop in an external jar file and select
- Link to files
- Create link locations relative to: PROJECT_LOC
3.
Refresh
4.
Select jar file under Referenced Libraries and open Properties
5.
Select Java Source Attachment 6 [details].
Attempting to use PROJECT_LOC in any path setting is not allowed.
