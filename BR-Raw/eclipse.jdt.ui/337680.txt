See the TODOs in AccessAnalyzer and GetterSetterUtil and bug 335173 comment 20.
Copying part of bug 335173 comment 20 for easy reference
> The problem can be solved by passing additional information to
> NecessaryParenthesesChecker#needsParentheses(..).
The additional information is
> only needed if the parentNode is a new InfixExpression node (not from a
> resolved AST), and it would be enough to just pass
> - the operator and
> - the type of the other operands to needParentheses(..), or null if not all
> operands have the same type.
> You'd have to refactor needsParenthesesInInfixExpression(..) a bit and probably
> turn isAllOperandsHaveSameType(..) into getCommonOperandsType(..).
> 
> Most callers of
> NecessaryParenthesesChecker#needsParentheses(..) won't need to be touched, but
> special cases like AccessAnalyzer will have to call a new method (which will
> share most of the implementation with the current needsParentheses(..)).
