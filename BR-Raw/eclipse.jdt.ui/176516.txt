Bug 176516 – [build path] Compiler Compliance should follow Execution Environment
From bug 134257 comment 2:
When a Java project is bound to an EE (via JRE container), changing
the EE should update the compliance setting.
For example, I had a project bound
to J2SE1.5, and later changed it to J2SE1.4.
The compliance settings remained
at 5.0 - I was confused when I could not run programs on a 1.4 VM due to
incompatible settings (i.e.
running 1.5 code on 1.4 VM).
I expected that the
compliance settings would have updated automatically.
Best would be a setting on the Compiler properties page that links the compiler compliance to the EE of the project (caveat: there's currently no default EE for a workspace).
The problem is again that JDT/Core does not know about EEs, so JDT/UI would have to listen to classpath changes to update the compiler settings.
