Bug 395989 – [generalize type] Generalize Declared Type does not consider use of variable in throw statement, which yields compilation error
Steps to reproduce:
1.
See the instructions in code below
2.
The resulting code does not compile ("No exception of type Object can be thrown; an exception type must be a subclass of Throwable")
class GeneralizeDeclaredTypeBug3 {
void f() throws Exception {
// Invoke "Generalize Declared Type" on "Exception"
// and select "Object" as new type
Exception e = new Exception();
throw e;
}
}
