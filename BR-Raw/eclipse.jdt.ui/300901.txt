Bug 300901 – [call hierarchy] 'Counter color' is ignored
I20100125-1800
1.
Make a Java file like the one below.
2.
Invoke Ctrl+Alt+H on v(), you'll get something like "w() : void - Test (2 matches)"
3.
Window > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts > Basic > Counter Color
4.
Change the colour to something else.
5.
Hit 'Apply'.
Nothing happens.
6.
Hit 'OK'.
Nothing happens.
7.
Try invoking call hierarchy again to force a "refresh".
No dice.
This seemed to work on Boris's Mac though.
