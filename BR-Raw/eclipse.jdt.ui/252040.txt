Bug 252040 – [quick assist] 'Convert Switch to If' changes semantics (should extract key into local variable)
N20081005-2000
Consider the following snippet:
---------------------------------
package p;
public class A {
public static void main(String[] args) {
switch(getSomethingWithSideEffects()) {
case 1:
break;
case 2:
break;
default:
}
}
private static int getSomethingWithSideEffects() {
System.out.println("side effect");
return 2;
}
}
-----------------------
After applying the "Convert switch to If" quick assist it leads to different semantics as the method with sideeffects is called twice instead of once.
I think this could be handled by assigned the method result to a new local var which is then used in the if/else expressions.
