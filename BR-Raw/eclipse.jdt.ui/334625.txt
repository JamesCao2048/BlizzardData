Bug 334625 – [jar exporter] Destination starting with '/' or '\' announced as being relative to the workspace
3.7 M4 but broken since 3.0.
When using a destination starting with '/' or '\' in the JAR exporter the wizard's descriptions says that it will be relative to the workspace.
This is wrong, it will be in the root of the current working directory (user.dir).
1.
in the JAR Export wizard's 'JAR file' field enter: "/foo.jar or \foo.jar
==> the wizard's description says: "The export destination will be relative to your workspace."
2.
export
==> observe: the file will not be placed relative to the workspace.
