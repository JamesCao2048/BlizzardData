Bug 60703 – [performance] M8 Editors take longer to open than R2.x editors
I do some routine meaurements on editors we provide over base Eclipse, and while
doing those measurements noticed, using M8, that even the basic text editor and
the java editor take nearly twice as long to open on M8 than they do on the R2.
1x stream.
I'll attach a file/table that shows the numbers I'm seeing.
These
measurements are taken with fairly large files (around 300K).
The 'delta'
measurements are basically just from marking time before and after a call to
workbench.openEditor(...).
I've done a bit of profiling with 0428 build (post M8) and noticed one thing
right off.
For these 300K files, there is over a million calls to String.
charAt(int), traceable back to 4 calls to AbstractLineTracker.set(String).
My
guess is that some things are being unnecessarily initialized multiple times.
That's with basic text editor and java editor.
Things appear even worse for Java Editor, there's also over a million calls to
JavaCodeScanner.access$0(), stemming from JavaCodeScanner$MethodNameRule.
evaluate(ICharacterScanner).
I know the number of calls isn't necessarily by itself a problem, I just note
those as things to investigate.
