Bug 297663 – [JUnit] JUnit not found when JDT installed as dropin
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091105 Fedora/3.5.5-1.fc12 Firefox/3.5.5
Build Identifier: M20090917-0800
Fedora 12 packages JDT as a dropin in the shared installation area, which is read-only to normal users.
If you try to add the JUnit library to a project, you receive a message in the wizard saying "The selected JUnit version is not available".
I've tracked this down to the following problem:
The install area bundles.info does not have the org.junit plugin in it.
This file is in:
/usr/lib/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info
The config area bundles.info actually does have the org.junit plugin in it.
It looks like:
[phiggins@xeno ~]$ grep '^org.junit' .eclipse/*/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info
org.junit,3.8.2.v20090203-1005,dropins/jdt/plugins/org.junit_3.8.2.v20090203-1005/,4,false
org.junit4,4.5.0.v20090824,dropins/jdt/plugins/org.junit4_4.5.0.v20090824/,4,false
As you can see, it uses a relative URL to the dropins directory, which is actually in the shared install location: /usr/lib/eclipse/dropins
The plugin does not exist in my private config area.
I have created a patch to org/eclipse/jdt/internal/junit/buildpath/P2Utils.java which resolves relative URLs first to the config area and then to the install location when reading bundles from the config area.
This patch fixes the problem for me.
I will attach the patch shortly.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Install the org.junit plugin in a shared install location
2.
Remove the org.junit plugin from your config area if it exists
3.
Remove the reference to the org.junit plugin from the shared install location bundles.info
4.
Add a reference to the org.junit plugin to your config area bundles.info using a relative URL
5.
