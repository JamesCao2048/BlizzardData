Bug 331311 – [syntax highlighting] Syntax coloring for abstract classes
Build Identifier: 20100917-0705
I find it very useful to colorizes interfaces and abstract classes with the same color with JDT built in syntax coloring.
Unfortunately, it isn't possible to assign different colors for classes and abstract classes in preferences->java->syntax coloring->element->java.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Open a java source file containing references to classes and abstract classes and try to assign different colors.
