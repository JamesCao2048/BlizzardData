Bug 492173 – Missing styling for the new Java project wizard
Created attachment 261150 [details]
Screenshot
The second page for the new Java project wizard looks really bad in the dark theme.
We need to investigate if there is something missing in our dark theme or if the JDT people need to style it on there side.
