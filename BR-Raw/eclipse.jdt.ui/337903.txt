Bug 337903 – [quick fix] for raw type warning, should at least be as good as for unresolved type
HEAD
The quick fix for a raw type warning should at least be as good as for an unresolved type.
import java.util.*;
public class Try {
void foo(Stack<List<Integer>> stack) {
List li= stack.pop();
Lost lo= stack.pop();
}
}
For the first type (List), the only quick fix is Infer Generic Type Arguments, and that infers List<?>.
But for the second type (Lost), the first quick fix offers to change the type to List<Integer>, which is all we need.
Bug 318433 should fix Infer Generic Type Arguments, but we should still enable the working quick fix that just fixes that problem.
Beware of duplicate quick fixes when the file doesn't contain any compile errors (just warnings)!
