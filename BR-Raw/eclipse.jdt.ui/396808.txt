Bug 396808 – [hovering] Package hovering shows multiple hyperlinks if the package is present in multiple location in the build path.
Hover over the package import java.lang.*; code present in a java file.
Make sure the package is present in multiple jars and the jars are included in the classpath of the current project.
While hovering multiple links of "java.lang" are displayed in the hover window and all of them point to the same Javadoc content.
Duplicate link should not be displayed in the hover window if the Javadoc contents are the same.
