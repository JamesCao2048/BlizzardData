Bug 427169 – [1.8][quick assist] lambda body: convert expression to block
I was playing with a lambda with a simple expression, and then I wanted to add slightly more logic which required me to use a block instead of the expression.
Wouldn't it be cool if JDT/UI offered a quick assist
"Convert body expression to block"? :)
To convert this:
void assistDemo(boolean flag) {
perform(() -> 13);
}
into this:
void assistDemo(boolean flag) {
perform(() -> {
return 13;
});
}
(And perhaps the inverse, too, if possible).
