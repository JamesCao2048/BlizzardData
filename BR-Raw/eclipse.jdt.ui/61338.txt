Bug 61338 – [Search] Sometimes the Search dialog loses all its bottom buttons in Solaris
Eclipse 200405060200
Sometimes the Search dialog loses all its bottom buttons in Solaris.
 I've
noticed it 3 times while I was testing Search.
 I had to close the dialog by
pressing the 'x' and when I went back into the search dialog, the buttons came
back.
There has been a lot of inconsistency in the UI on Motif.
