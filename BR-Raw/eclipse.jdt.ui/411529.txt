Bug 411529 – [move method refactoring] reference to protected method
package p;
public class A {
protected void m(){}
}
package p;
public class B {
public void n(q.C c, A a) {
a.m();
}
}
package q;
public class C {
}
When p.B.n(q.C, A) is moved to q.C, Eclipse move-refactoring pops up a warning message:
"The visibility of method `p.A.m()' will be changed to public."
When I click the `continue' button to finish the refactoring, p.A.m() is still `protected' (no changes).
That is an error.
