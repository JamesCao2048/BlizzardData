Bug 331845 – [quick assist] Provide 'Add parentheses ....' quick assist
Created attachment 184534 [details]
fix v0.9
Currently this is available as a quick fix (i.e.
when there is an error and adding parenthesis fixes the error).
It would be extremely useful to have this available as a quick assist as well.
Attached patch should do the job.
