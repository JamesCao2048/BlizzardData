Bug 126625 – Added missing options for formatting annotation types
Right now the formatter is sharing the same options to format the annotation type declaration and the type declaration.
We could add the following two options to make the formatting of annotation consistent with enum and type declarations.
FORMATTER_INDENT_BODY_DECLARATIONS_COMPARE_TO_ANNOTATION_DECLARATION_HEADER
FORMATTER_INSERT_NEW_LINE_IN_EMPTY_ANNOTATION_DECLARATION
