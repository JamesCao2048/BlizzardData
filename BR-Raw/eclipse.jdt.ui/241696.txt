Bug 241696 – [quick fix][quick assist] quickfix to iterate over a collection

It would be convenient to have a quickfix for iterating over a collection without the need to store it (eg as a local var).
void foo(Map<String, Integer> map) {
map.keySet()<-- Cursor position here
}
The best way (I know) to iterate over a computed collection is
- quickfix to assign as local var
- use the foreach template
- inline the local var
A quickfix for iterating over the collection at the cursor position could save several key strokes.
