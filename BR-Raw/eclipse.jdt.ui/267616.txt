Bug 267616 – [rename] Rename method fails to create a method handle
Build ID: M20090211-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
place the cursor in the middle of a method selector
2.
Shift-Alt-R to rename it
3.
Ctrl-Backspace to delete first part of selector
4.
Ctrl-Delete to delete rest of selector
5.
type new name
6.
Return
A dialog pops up saying:
Could not create a method handle for project '{0}' with handle identifier '=YouProject/src<your.packagepath{YourClass.java[YourClass~yourMethod~QYourArgtype;'
Reproducable in 3.4.2 but NOT in 3.4.1
Initial debugging yields:
+ the method handle memento is OK, but the method cannot be found in the java model.
+ refactoring tries to undo the editing but step 5.
is missing from the undo history! => Method is not present in the java model due to missing selector.
