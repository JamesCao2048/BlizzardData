Bug 113731 – [refactoring] preview page gets bigger and bigger
Hi
I am not quite sure if this is the right Component to report this bug - for an
outsider it is quite difficult to determine which Component causes a "strange"
behaviour.
Here is my bug:
Calling the refactoring on and on again causes the "Rename Package" Window to
get a little bit bigger every time.
I use IBM RAD 6.0.1 but I think this feature has nothing to do with the extra
stuff from IBM.
Cheers,
Thomas
