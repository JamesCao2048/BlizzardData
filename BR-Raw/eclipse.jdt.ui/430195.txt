Bug 430195 – [1.8][model][api] Lambda IType API problems (isLambda(); getElementName() returns "")
API problems in the IType for a lambda:
- getElementName() should return an empty name, like for anonymous types (this is currently specified in the Javadoc of IType, but that should be copied or moved to getElementName()).
The current "Lambda(FunctionalInterfaceName)" violates the "simple name" statement in IType#getElementName().
And it make sense not to perform some ad-hoc rendering in jdt.core.
Caveat: Implementation of SourceType#isAnonymous() is:
return this.name.length() == 0
- specify getTypeQualified*(..) APIs for lambda types
- add API isLambda()
- add note in IType Javadoc that ITypes for lambda expressions are pseudo-elements like ILocalVariable that are not returned by getChildren() on their parent
