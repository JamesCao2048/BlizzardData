Bug 305255 – [preferences] Accept jsr14 as a build target
Created attachment 161539 [details]
Screenshot showing the problem
In p2 we are currently targeting jsr14, that is, using Java 5 syntax but building down to Java 1.4 bytecode.
 The target was set manually in the jdt preferences, but if you open the project properties, you get some strange errors (see attached screenshot).
Can jsr14 be added as a option for generated .class compatibility?
