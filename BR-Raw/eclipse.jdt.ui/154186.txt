Bug 154186 – [working sets] Improve "Edit Working-Set" Dialog
Adding new files to a working set is really a pain:
I have to edit the working set and browse until I reach the package or file I want to add.
This could be done more easily from the Package Explorer or Editor Context menu.
Sometimes, there is already a "Remove from working set" entry, but not for all items.
And the "Add to..." working set is completely missing.
This would be useful in the "Other projects..." tree or even in another working set.
While this is "only" an enhancement, I would regard this as a higher priority.
Thanks, JÃ¶rg
