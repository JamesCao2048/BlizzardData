Bug 19145 – [Wizards] Make wizards resizable and keep bounds
Both the Checkbox Tree and the Checkbox List have horizontal scrollbars because
mose package names and type names don't fit in the default size.
It would be nice to be able to size this dialog bigger, and have it have a
wider default size (I assume it is sized for 640x480? but is could be wider).
