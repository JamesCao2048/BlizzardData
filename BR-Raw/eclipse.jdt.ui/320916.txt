Bug 320916 – [preferences] Content Assist > Advanced: Read description for entry fields
3.6 and HEAD.
From bug 272167 comment 13:
Btw:
There is a small enhancement in that page regarding accessibility.
Provide some description to the field that contains the delay value and to the
field that contains the trigger value.
Actually orca only reads the value of that fields, no description is present.
The desired behavior is present in content assist preferences of ant editor.
