Bug 334864 – [JUnit] Opening @Ignored test classes from JUnit view leads to "Method '...' not found. Opening the test class." warning
Build Identifier:  20100917-0705
I have some JUnit 4 unit tests where I've marked the whole class with @Ignore.
This gives a (correct) output on the JUnit view.
If I want to open those tests via double-click in the JUnit view, I get a "Method '...' not found.
Opening the test class." warning.
This is not ok, since I never indended to open a method but the whole class.
Clicking on ok opens the class (which is again ok)
--> please don't show that warning in that case since it makes no sense
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
write a Junit 4 unit test
2.
mark the whole class with @Ignore
3.
run your tests
4.
double-click on the ignored test in the Junit view
