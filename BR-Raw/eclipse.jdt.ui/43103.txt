Bug 43103 – RenameType Refactoring - detected information not shown
Test failures in
http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.0M3-200308281813/testResults.php
are not visible if the tests are executed manually in Eclipse.
The information is not shown because primary != working copy ...
I'll attach a patch.
