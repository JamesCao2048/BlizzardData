Bug 443309 – tearDownAfterClass() in NewTestCaseCreationWizard gets disabled when something else is clicked on
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Open New JUnit Test Case Wizard (NewTestCaseCreationWizard)
2.
See, that tearDownAfterClass() checkbox is enabled.
3.
FAIL Click on any checkbox in "Which method stubs would you like to create?" section -> tearDownAfterClass() checkbox turns disabled.
I think that this is not desired behavior.
