Bug 64108 – Javadoc keywords settings no longer work in Java Editor
Using build I200405260010.
I've noticed that Javadoc keywords (ie.
tag names in javadoc comments) were no
longer highlighted.
Trying to see if my preferences were reset and then realized
that whatever color or style I set for Javadoc keywords, they stay unchanged...
