Bug 252415 – [build path] New Java Project dialog radios should have same parent
Build id: I20081027-1800
1) File->New->Java Project
The "New Java Project" dialog opens, and focus is in the "Project name:" text field.
2) Type the Tab key twice to move the focus to the "JRE" group of radios.
3) Type Tab one more time.
Focus moves to the next radio in the group? This is not supposed to happen.
Also, the next radio in the group becomes selected? This is not supposed to happen either.
It would be very confusing to a screen reader user, who would not be able to see the visual relationship of the radios.
The problem is that the "Use default JRE" radio (the topmost one) does not have the same parent as the "Use a project specific JRE" or "Use an exception environment JRE" radios.
They need to have the same parent in order to work the way the platform intended.
(i.e.
you will also note that you cannot use arrow keys to traverse from the top radio to the other two, but you should be able to).
I suspect that this was done in order to do the layout.
However, this layout can be achieved with just one Composite and 3 columns in a GridLayout.
