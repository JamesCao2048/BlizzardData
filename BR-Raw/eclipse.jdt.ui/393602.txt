Combined hover - values missing and ctrl-1 hover - everything is ok
Hello, I have Arch Linux x64, KDE.
The problem that appeared is that when I hover over a problem, e.g.
a class that isn't imported, the combined hover appears but some values are not present.
If I press ctrl+1, everything appears fine.
This happens to: "import", "create class", "change to" etc.
I attach an example (2 pictures)
