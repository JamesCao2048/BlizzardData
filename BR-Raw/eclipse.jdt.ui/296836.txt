Bug 296836 – 2 messages removed from ActionMessages
The following 2 static variables have been removed from the JDT.
Unfortunately, this is breaking our compatibility between Eclipse 3.4 and 3.6.
I would appreciate if we could bring them back:
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.ActionMessages.OrganizeImportsAction_summary_added
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.ActionMessages.OrganizeImportsAction_summary_removed
Thanks,
~Loic
