Bug 111653 – [misc] Dialogs remembering last location will help them open on correct monitor
The original bug reporting this problem is bug #108801.
In that bug we discussed the solution being dialogs remembering their last
location.
The text dialog specifically mentioned in the original bug was GotoLineDialog,
but consider this a request to apply the feature where appropriate.
