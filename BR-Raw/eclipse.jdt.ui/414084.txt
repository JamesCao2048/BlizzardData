Bug 414084 – [1.8][quick fix] Add more quick fix proposals for implicit abstract method with body in interface
Consider the below code:
interface test{
public void m1(){
}
For m1(), currently user is provided with a single Quick Fix proposal which will remove the body of the method.
Ideally from Java 1.8, the method can be either default or static, hence we need to provide 2 new proposals here.
The Quick Fix proposals will be:
1.
Remove method body
2.
Add 'default' modifier
3.
Add 'static' modifier
