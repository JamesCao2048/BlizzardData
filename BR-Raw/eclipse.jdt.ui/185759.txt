Bug 185759 – [introduce parameter object] should test if class already exists
M7
- in the following example use 'Introduce Parameter Object' on 'add'
- name the new class E
- create it as inner class
- the result doesn't compile as 'E' as the new class conflicts with the existing 'E'
- The input dialog should make sure that no class exists at the destination with the same name
package e;
public class A {
class E {
}
public int add(int x, int y) {
return x + y;
}
}
