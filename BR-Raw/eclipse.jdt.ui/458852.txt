Bug 458852 – [search] Speed up JDT text searches by supporting parallelism in its TextSearchRequestors
Bug 458704 introduced new API to TextSearchRequestor to support faster text searches.
Update the JDT's TextSearchRequestors to support collecting results from multiple jobs running in parallel.
I see three subclasses of TextSearchRequestor:
1) org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.util.QualifiedNameFinder.ResultCollector, which is used in package rename refactorings
2) org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.propertiesfileeditor.PropertyKeyHyperlink.ResultCollector, which is used to find hyperlink targets to keys in .properties files
3) An anonymous class in org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.MyRenameTypeParticipant.createChange(), which is in the org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests plug-in
Dani, do you know of any other subclasses?
