1.
Open a child drop down of a Type in the breadcrumb by clicking on the arrow
2.
Select a member to reveal in editor
3.
Open a drop down menu in the toolbar (i.e.
debug launch configs)
4.
Open the types child drop down again
5.
Select a member
Is:
Member is revealed and drop down does not close
Should:
Drop down must close
Major, because from now on the drop downs don't close anymore.
No idea what that is, can not reproduce on XP.
