Bug 12044 – [search] Should find constant references in .class files with source attached
1.
In Outline view select java.text.DateFormat.HOUR_OF_DAY0_FIELD
2.
Search for References in workspace
==> nothing found
Note 1: It finds references in .java files but not in JARs.
Note 2: Search for all Occurrences (via search dialog) correctly returns the
references
