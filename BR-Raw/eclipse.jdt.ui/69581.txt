Bug 69581 – [templates] Templates view
Hello,
I would like to propose a new kind of view we can find in other IDE like sharp
develop for instance.
It is the scout view (in #develop idiom) and consists in
proposing in a palette vieww by category code snipets that we can drag and drop
into the current editor.
For some kind of works, it is better than code assist
because we can't recall in mind every key shortcuts, and it is a good help to
have  that presented visually.
