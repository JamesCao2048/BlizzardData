Bug 17317 – Preference Pages taller than the screen 1024x768
build 20020521
The preference pages is to big to fit on the screen 1024x768
1) Go on the menu: Windows -> Preferences
2) Look the page Java->Editor (First Tab: Appearance)
When the preference page comes out it is big than the screen, so I have to
resize (or move) it in order to reach the Button Close, for instance.
For the Java->Editor, when I resize it the Table on bottom ("Appearance color
options") is hidden, so I have to be dacing with the preference page resizing
and moving when I need to change some thing.
I guess there to many option on the same page, test replace the table by a
Combo, or split the options on one more tabpage.
Note, you cannot see the problem on Windows, have to be Motif since the Motif
borders and trims are bigger than windows.
