Bug 432515 – [1.8][rename] Method renaming does not work well for method reference
If I rename the mul() method to mulx() in following code:
public class Test02 {
private static class Multiplier {
private final long mMul;
public Multiplier(long iMul) {
this.mMul = iMul;
}
public Long mul(Long iItem) {
return iItem * mMul;
}
}
private static void test(UnaryOperator<Long> iFn) {
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
UnaryOperator<Long> mul = (new Multiplier(3))::mul;
test((new Multiplier(3))::mul);
}
}
it renames the 'Multiplier' constructor in both (new Multiplier(3))::mul occurrences.
The result is (new mulx(3))::mul
But preview during renaming looks good, i.e.
all occurrences of method name are found well just final renaming fails.
