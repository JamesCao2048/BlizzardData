Bug 284793 – [quick assist] convert anonymous type fails silently if a class of the destination name already exists
Build ID: I20090611-1540
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Paste the class below into a new project.
2.
Invoke Ctrl+1 -> "Convert anonymous to nested class" on first Runnable (accept the default class name)
3.
Invoke Ctrl+1 -> "Convert anonymous to nested class" on the second Runnable.
4.
Observe that no refactoring is performed for the second invocation.
(It works if you either change the class name or use the Refactor menu for the second refactoring instead of the quickfix)
public class MultiAnonymous {
Runnable x = new Runnable() {
public void run() {
System.out.println(0);
}
};
Runnable y = new Runnable() {
public void run() {
System.out.println(42);
}
};
}
