Bug 339223 – [quick fix][quick assist] Replace integer literals for relevance with int constants
Relevance of Quick fixes and Quick assists is hardcoded as integer literals, which makes it almost impossible to compare relevance of Quick fixes/assists.
We should replace integer literals with int constants so that a reference search on the constants can be done to make it easier to compare relevance.
