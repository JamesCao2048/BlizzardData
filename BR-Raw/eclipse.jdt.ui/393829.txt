Bug 393829 – [change method signature] Precondition fails with exception when applying refactoring on a method of an anonyous class passed as argument
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Invoke "Change Method Signature" on method "a"
2.
Reorder parameters "par1" and "par2" (i.e., put "par1" "Down")
3.
There is an exception reported in a dialog
public class ChangeMethodSignatureBug {
public ChangeMethodSignatureBug(Object obj) {
}
public void m() {
new ChangeMethodSignatureBug(new Object() {
public void a(Object par1, Object par2) {
}
});
}
}
