Bug 394296 – [clean up] Clean up doesn't work if warnings were suppressed
I noticed that the "Source > Clean Up..." action doesn't cleanup defects when warnings were suppressed.
For example, if I ask the cleanup to add missing Overrides and I have disabled all warnings, then the @Override is not added.
If I remove the "@SuppressWarnings("all")", then the @Override is added:
@SuppressWarnings("all")
public class Test extends java.util.ArrayList<String> {
private static final long serialVersionUID = -394398626433235653L;
public boolean add(String e) {
return super.add(e);
}
}
The same thing happens for "use modifier 'final' where possible", "Change all accesses through subtypes", "Remove unnecessary '$NON-NLS$' tags", etc.
rendering the Cleanup action much less useful in the presence of a @SuppressWarnings("all").
