Bug 289655 – [rename] Refactor rename in editor is slow with many matches
test case:
public class Test {
public void test(Object asdf) {
if (asdf == null) asdf = null;
if (asdf == null) asdf = null;
if (asdf == null) asdf = null;
if (asdf == null) asdf = null;
if (asdf == null) asdf = null;
if (asdf == null) asdf = null;
}
}
Use Alt-Shift-R refactoring to change the name of asdf variable.
Type quickly and you'll notice the editor quickly falls behind your typing.
While investigating this we found that RenameInformationPopup calls updatePopupLocation every time a textChanged or keyPressed event occurs.
This means a lot of calls to pack the shell, then update the region and change the shell's height to be one pixel taller.
Resizing the shell less would really improve perfomance here on all platforms.
