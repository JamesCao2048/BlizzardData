Bug 478136 – [1.8][clean up] Lambda rewriter removes annotations from method
public class Class {
public void method() {
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
@Override
@Deprecated
public void run() {
}
};
r.run();
}
}
When I process this code snippet with the lambda replacer, the result is:
public class Class {
public void method() {
Runnable r = () -> {
};
r.run();
}
}
The @Deprecated annotation has been removed.
Since this also happens with other annotations, it has an effect especially in code that uses annotations for AspectJ weaving.
The lambda cleanup should only remove @Override annotations.
