Bug 329720 – [hover] There is no preference to change background color of debug hover popup
The background color of the debug hover popup on Linux Lucid Lynx is inherited from the desktop theme.
For dark color schemes this leads to black text on a dark grey background.
There should be a preference for setting background color of debug hover popup within Eclipse independently from the desktop theme.
