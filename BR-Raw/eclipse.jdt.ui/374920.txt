Bug 374920 – [preferences] Non-intuitive tab order on editor preferences dialog
1.
Open preferences.
2.
Go to the Editor option.
3.
Tab through the various preferences.
The Bracket highlighting radio buttons come before any of the checkboxes above them.
It should probably be made so it is consistent with the rest of the preference dialogs, i.e.
so that the tab order has the higher up controls first.
