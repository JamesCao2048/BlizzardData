Steps
- New Workspace
- New Java project
- In 'Project Explorer' right click on the java project -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path
- 'Libraries' tab -> 'Add Library' -> add JUnit 3 and click Ok to close the dialog => The newly added library does not show up in Project Explorer
- Manually refresh the project (F5) => Library added in last step shows up
Auto refresh also does not happen when the library is removed.
