Bug 46332 – [Jobs] UI no longer responsive after pressing ctrl-S
Build 20031023
While tagging JDT Core projects as versions (in background), I went to modify
my map file accordingly in parallel.
As soon as pressed ctrl-S to save my
edited map file, the busy cursor appeared and I couldn't do anything any
longer; though this change has nothing to do with what is being tagged at the
same time.
Furthermore, there is no explanation as to why my save action locked me until
the tagging was completed.
