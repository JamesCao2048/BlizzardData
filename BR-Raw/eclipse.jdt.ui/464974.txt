Problem Description:
Wrong display of structured text (file path) including bidi data on External Annotation Attachment Configuration panel.
Platform provides following level of support for structured text:
1.
Dynamic cases (editable controls, like input fields, combo box etc.)
Use following API (from org.eclipse.jface.util.BidiUtils package) in the appropriate graphical
context (label, field):
BidiUtils.applyBidiProcessing(sourceField, StructuredTextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE);
sourceField is the control in which file path appears.
2.
Static cases (not editable controls like labels)
One need to work on the string level (rather than on graphical control level).
You should use function leanToFullText defined in the class: org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal.StructuredTextImpl.
Sample call :
resultStr =
STextExpertFactory.getExpert(STextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE).leanToFullText (inputStr)
Please help investigate.Thanks.
