Bug 264722 – Get rid of duplicate working set comparators
N20090212-2000.
We currently have two working set comparators (WorkingSetSortComparator and WorkingSetComparator).
We should remove one and make the remaining one configurable whether to sort the "other" working set on top.
The remaining one should live in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.workingsets.
