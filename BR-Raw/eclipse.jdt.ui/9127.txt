Bug 9127 – JAR Packager: Path of exported resource wrong if src folder not under project
Create J project
Create folder /x/y
Define y as source folder ==> x/y appears as source folder
==> Files in x don't get exported
==> Path for resource files in x/y/ are wrong (i.e.
contain /x/y)
Note: *.java and *.class files are exported correctly.
