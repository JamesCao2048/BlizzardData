Bug 434791 – [inline][quick assist] Delete key does not work after Inline local variable
If the command Quick Assist - Inline local variable is bound to Ctrl+Alt+Right in Preferences->General->Keys and that combination is activated and a local variable is thus inlined, pressing the Delete key afterwards has no effect.
Delete key starts working again after some characters are selected with Shift+Any arrow key or the caret jumps to a different location by pressing Ctrl+Right, Ctrl+Left, Home, End.
To reproduce the bug, take this source:
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.function.Supplier;
import java.util.stream.Collector;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
class DeleteKey<T> {
public void inline() {
// inline collectionFactory by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Right with the caret within it:
Supplier<ArrayList<T>> collectionFactory = ArrayList<T>::new;
Collector<T, ?, ArrayList<T>> collection = Collectors.toCollection(collectionFactory);
}
}
Steps:
1.
Open Preferences -> General -> Keys and find Quick Assist - Inline local variable, bind it to the key combination Ctrl+Alt+Right Arrow, and press OK.
2.
Move the caret in the middle of the name of the variable collectionFactory.
3.
Press Ctrl+Alt+Right Arrow key combination.
4.
Press Delete, but it doesn't delete anything.
