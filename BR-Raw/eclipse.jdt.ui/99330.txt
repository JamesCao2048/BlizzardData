Bug 99330 – [implementation] Don't swallow IllegalStateException in ASTprovider
20050610-0010
See bug 97214.
Instead of swallowing all IllegalStateExceptions (that represent
a programmer error when using the ASTProvider) the code should avoid creating
the AST in the given situation (by first checking that the classfile really has
a source)
