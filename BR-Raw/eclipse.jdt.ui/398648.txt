Bug 398648 – Javadoc View inserts wrong asterisk when @see contains link with linebreak
Reproduce:
- Create a class Main.java in Eclipse and open it:
/**
* @see <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google
* is your friend</a>
*/
public class Main {}
- open Javadoc quick preview: Put the cursor on the word "Main" and press "F2"
- or open Javadoc View for Main
What happens:
The text of the link is shown as "Google * is your friend"
What should happen:
The text of the link should be "Goolge is you friend".
Without the asterisk from the left side of the Javadoc.
When the Javadoc is created with the Javadoc tool, the asterisk is not in the text.
This works correctly when the link with linebreak is in the normal Javadoc body and not in the @see-tag.
I encountered this bug when my link was very long and formatting the source would insert the linbreak.
For long links this is quite annoying.
