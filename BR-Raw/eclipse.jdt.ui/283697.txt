Bug 283697 – [quick fix] Add missing @Override should be first on suggestions
When using JDK 1.5, and I press control-1 on an elem with a missing override warning, the "Add missing @Override" is last on the list, after a bunch of (most of the time) useless suggestions about renaming or creating methods.
 Adding the @Override is what is wanted almost all of the time.
