Bug 304193 – regressions in CleanUpPerfTest and MoveStaticMembersPerfTests* observed since build N20100218-2000
Verifying results for I20100224-2242 build, it looks like there are confirmed regressions since N20100218-2000 build for several JDT/UI perf tests:
- CleanUpPerfTest#testCodeStyleCleanUp()
- MoveStaticMembersPerfTests1#test_1000_10()
- MoveStaticMembersPerfTests2#test_10_1000()
Note that some other non-fingerprints tests are also concerned:
- MoveStaticMembersPerfTests1#test_100_10()
- MoveStaticMembersPerfTests2#test_10_100()
