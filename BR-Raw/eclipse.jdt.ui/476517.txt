Bug 476517 – [1.8][quick fix] "Add unimplemented methods" creates stubs for methods with default implementation
The problem is like this:
let's say first there was an interface to be implemented by clients
interface IHasInt {
int getInt();
}
Later you want the implementors to be able to provide a BigInteger, without breaking old implementors and without the need to implement the old method for new implementors (And the caller wants to be able to distinguish old and new implementations).
So you define
interface IHasIntAsBigInteger extends IHasInt {
default int getInt() {
return getIntAsBigInteger().intValue();
}
getIntAsBigInteger();
}
If a class implements IHasIntAsBigInteger and the dev applies "add unimplemented methods".
Stubs for both methods are created, which is bad.
Propably due to the fact that both methods occur abstract somewhere in the interface hierarchy, not eliminating those with a default occurance.
