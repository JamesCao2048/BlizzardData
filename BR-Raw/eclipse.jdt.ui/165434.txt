Bug 165434 – [Structure Viewers] Reconcile structure upon document changes
I20061121-1845
I often get confused when using the compare views by the stale information in the structure comparison which only updates on safe.
I'd like to have the option that the structure compare updates when the content changes, e.g.
when I move a change from right to left or the other way around.
