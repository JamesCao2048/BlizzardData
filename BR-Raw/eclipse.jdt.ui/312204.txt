Bug 312204 – [api][JUnit] Allow changing the default superclass in NewTestCaseWizardPageOne
Build Identifier: 20100506-2000
Groovy Eclipse is subclassing from NewTestCaseWizardPageOne to create JUnit wizard for Groovy.
It is hard to change the default superclass used for a JUnit3 style testcase.
Using setSuperClass doesn't quite work because there is a call to a private method  "internalSetJUnit4" which will reset it when a user clicks the JUnit radio buttons.
I've attached a patch with a proposed solution that makes a minimal change NewTestCaseWizardPageOne class.
The change is behavior preserving, but it delegates the choice of the default superclass for JUnit 3 tests to a protected method which can easily be overriden.
Reproducible: Always
