Bug 489202 – [save actions] Format edited lines on Save formats lines with non-ASCII characters
The "Format edited lines" Save Action formats lines with non-ASCII characters, even the lines were not touched.
Steps:
- have a project with Cp1252 encoding
- save this snippet in a *.java file with UTF-8 encoding:
package tests.saveaction;
public class LongLines{
void foo() {
System.out.println("C:\\temp\\×‘×’×§×›\\×©× .txt"); // file is 2 chars, folder is 4 chars
System.out.println("Here's a Java method: Does it need line breaks? " + "p." + "abc" + "(" + "abcdef f" + ", " + "abcdef2 f2" + ");");
System.out.println("Here's a Java method: Does it need line breaks? " + "×©." + "×©× ×‘" + "(" + "×© ×©× ×‘×’×§×›" + ", " + "2×© 2×©× ×‘×’×§×›" + ");");
}
}
- add a space at the end of the first line
- Save
=> expected: space gets removed
=> was:      space gets removed, and the two lines that contain Hebrew characters get formatted
The bug is in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.EditorUtility.calculateChangedLineRegions(...).new ISafeRunnable() {...}.run():
IFileBufferManager#connectFileStore(..) specifies that it should not be used with a file store for a file from the workspace.
Here, it doesn't fail for the reason specified in the Javadoc, but because connectFileStore creates a buffer with a wrong encoding (see FileStoreTextFileBuffer#cacheEncodingState(), which  uses the global default, and not the resource's encoding in the workspace).
