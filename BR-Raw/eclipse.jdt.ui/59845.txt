Bug 59845 – [performance] Opening a class file editor should not compute all overriding indicators
Relative to bug 57871, I think that the class file editor should compute the
overriding indicators in the background.
It can be really time consuming to get
and resolve all methods for the hierarchy just to update the indicator.
