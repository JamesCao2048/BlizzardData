Bug 404471 – [move method] Annotation error in applying move-refactoring to inherited methods
Class A is super-class of class B.
Method m of B is inherited from A.
public class A {
public void m(C c) {
}
}
public class B extends A {
@Override
public void m(C c) {
}
}
When method m of B is moved to class C (making delegate of m),
"@Override" annotation is also moved to C.
public class C {
@Override             //error
public void m() {
}
}
