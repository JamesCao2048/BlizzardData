Bug 269201 ñ [jar exporter] ant file produced by Export runnable jar contains absolute paths instead of relative to workspace
Build ID: I20090313-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Open project with a launch configuration
2.
File -> Export -> Java -> Runnable JAR file
3.
Fill out fields (we use the new Copy required libraries into a sub-folder) and check Save as ANT script with a filename (e.g.
c:\test.xml)
Open test.xml with a editor
See that all file and directory references are absolute including C:\...
More information:
It would be very beneficial if the paths put in the ant file are relative (if possible) from the workspace folder, and that that folder was stored in an ant variable
The same with the target directory.
This will allow us to put the generated ant script in our source repository, instead of having each developer generating the file themselves each time they start a new workspace.
This is such an important facility to us, that I am willing to help getting this ready for the release version of 3.5, if the Eclipse folks do not already have this in place.
