Bug 81983 – [preferences] Disabling and enabling folding on small file takes forever
3.1 M4
Using enable/disable folding on a small CU takes forever.
This is caused by the
recent change to apply the preference to all Java editors.
In another (hidden)
window (Debug) I had StyledText open which (understandably) took long to react
on the preference change.
Non-visible editor's should not react to this change until they become visible.
