Bug 338529 – [working sets] Clean up WorkingSetDropAdapterTest
I20110301-0800.
WorkingSetDropAdapterTest is ugly and does not correctly create the working sets.
Besides that I'd like to remove PackageExplorerPart.internalTestShowWorkingSets(IWorkingSet[]).
Use the Accessor to access non public stuff.
