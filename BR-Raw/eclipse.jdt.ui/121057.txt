Bug 121057 – [jres] 'Execution Environments' preference page not updated after JRE addition
I20051214-2000
- start with a new workspace and a 1.4 VM
- on the 'Installed JREs' page, add a 1.5 SDK
- without leaving the preferences dialog, go to the 'Execution Environments' page and select J2SE-1.5
=> compatible JREs list is empty, although I just installed one
