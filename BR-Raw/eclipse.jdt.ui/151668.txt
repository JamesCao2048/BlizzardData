Bug 151668 – [reorg] Copy action should NOT add 'copy of' prefix
Yes, I add this issue though it contradicts to issue #3985 and issue #33071.
I really wonder what the advantage of this prefix should be.
I never just wanted to create a copy where the name is not important like a backup.
Whenever I copy a file I want to specify a new name.
And there it is really annoying to remove the prefix over and over again.
If this is now different for other people (otherwise it would probably not have been added this way) it might make sense to make this prefix configurable.
