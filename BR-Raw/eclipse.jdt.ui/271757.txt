Bug 271757 – TextMergeViewer.createSourceViewer(...) should return SourceViewer
This is one of the issues mentioned on bug 259411.
It looks serious enough to make a separate bug out of it and not mix it with the others.
GOALS/BENEFITS:
org.eclipse.compare.contentmergeviewer.TextMergeViewer.createSourceViewer(Composite, int) should return concrete SourceViewer instead of ISourceViewer interface.
The ISourceViewer type is not enough for the MergeSourceViewer to work properly, the MergeSourceViewer requires methods which are not part of the ISourceViewer interface.
The concrete class of SourceViewer is the optimal return type.

RISKS:
The bad news is that the method is part API, the good news is that is has been introduced in 3.5.
So I guess the risk is low, especially given the fact that the API is marked as "experimental" and using it should be consulted with the Workspace team.
Impact is limited to JDT which is the only client of the new API so far.
Required changes are in the patch.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
None.
