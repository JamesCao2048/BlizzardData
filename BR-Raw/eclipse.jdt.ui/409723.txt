Refactor > Introduce Indirection on default and static methods in an interface gives the error "Cannot place new method on an interface." as shown in the attached screenshot.
Expected result for the default method is shown below:
public interface I {
public static void foo(I i) {
i.foo();
}
default void foo() {
}
}
