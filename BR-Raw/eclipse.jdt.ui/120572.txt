Bug 120572 – [implementation] ISelectionListenerWithAST not notified when opening CU from package explorer
3.2 M4 test pass
Similar to bug 119326, there is no notification to registered ISelectionListenerWithAST listeners in the following case:
- have two CU's containing FooClass and BarClass:
============ FooClass.java ==========
package pr119326;
public class FooClass {
}
=====================================
(- BarClass analogous, in the same package)
- check "double click" open mode on the "General" preference page
- open the package explorer (not as fast view)
- close all editors
- in the package explorer, double click on BarClass.java (the CU, not the class)
> note: all selection listeners are notified with an AST of BarClass
- in the package explorer, double click on FooClass.java (the CU, not the class)
> actual: all selection listeners are notified with an AST of BarClass again
< expected: notification with FooClass, not BarClass
Notes:
- the same works as expected with other open modes:
- single click
- context menu > open
- double click on class instead of CU
- it is not 100% reproducable, but about 90% on my machine
