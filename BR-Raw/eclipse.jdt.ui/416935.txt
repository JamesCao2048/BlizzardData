Bug 416935 – [JUnit] Initialize JUnit container & JUNIT_HOME doesn't work when there is no bundle.info
In the context of running JDT tests with Tycho, I noticed that the implementation of JUnitHomeInitializer relies on SimpleConfigurator and assumes that the product uses a bundles.info file to work.
However, it's not the case with Tycho Surefire tests, bundles are instead passed in the config.ini file, using the "osgi.bundles" property.
So it seems like current implementation is based on the wrong assumption that all RCP products use a bundles.info.
Instead, it should leverage the OSGi APIs, as we can more safely assume that any application using JDT is started in an OSGi container.
