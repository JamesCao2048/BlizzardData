Bug 344552 – Source tabs not cleared when project is closed
Build Identifier: M20100211-1343
When a project is opened, Problems, Javadoc & Declarations display the relevant data.
If the project is closed, these tab fields are not cleared and the (now irrelevant) data remains displayed.
It remains displayed even if the project is deleted (from the Edit menu).
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a new project
2.Close it from Project menu
3.Delete it from the Edit menu
