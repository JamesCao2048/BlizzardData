Bug 162856 – [build path] new project from existing sources in the workspace
I have a folder with many subfolders.
In this subfolders thera are another subfolders and source folders in them.
For example:
the main folder name is "git"
git->s1->f1->src
git->s1->f2->src
git->s2->f3->src
git->s2->f4->src
...
The folder "git" is in the workspace.
There is no project.
I want to create project in the folder "git".
I want Eclipse to find the src folders automatically.
I open New Project wizard and select Java Project.
I choose "Create project from existing source" and browse for folder "git".
I type a Project name.
There is an error.
I can't click Next because it is desabled.
There is a message "Cannot create project content in workspace".
Why? Where is the problem? My sources are already in the workspace and Eclipse have to create a project file.
I report this bug because there is something strange in the Eclipse and you have to fix it.
If I do the following steps everithing is ok and everything work correctly:
1.
move folder "git" outside the eclipse's workspace
2.
create new projet from existing source.
The Eclipse automatically found the source folders.
The Eclipse create .project file and .classpath file in the "git" folder.
3.
create new project "test" in workspace with no source folders.
4.
close eclipse
5.
move all files and subfolders from folder "git" to the new folder "test" in eclipse's workspace.
6.
open eclipse
7.
I have project with all source folders.
