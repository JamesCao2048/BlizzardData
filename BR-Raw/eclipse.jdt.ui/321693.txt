Bug 321693 – [preferences] Improve scroll bars in Errors/Warnings page
I20100804-0100
1.
(broken since at least 3.6) Out of the box, the Errors/Warnings preference page should come up without horizontal scroll bars (no matter what sections are expanded initially).
2.
With the filtering, the vertical scroll bar appears and disappears more often, which looks noisy.
We should try to show the vertical scroll bar all the time, but still keep the horizontal bar appearing dynamically if necessary.
