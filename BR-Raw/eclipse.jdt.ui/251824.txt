Bug 251824 – [save actions][clean up] Correct Indentation blocks Remove trailing whitespace from working in comments
Build ID: M20080911-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Enable save actions 'remove trailing whitespace' and 'correct indentation'.
2.
Create a new class, add a first line of comment.
3.
Hit return a few times to add blank lines of comment.
4.
Save.
5.
Note trailing whitespace...
6.
Disable 'remove trailing whitespace'.
7.
Make a further edit (more blank lines, whatever) and save.
8.
Note no trailing whitespace.
More information:
Maybe bug 173081 is related?  Seems undesirable to ever leave trailing whitespace if the user chooses to remove it.
For example, we have a coding style check that our files don't contain trailing whitespace and naturally it doesn't make any exemptions for comments or anything else.
It seems like its trimming whitespace first then correcting indentation which involves adding trailing whitespace to blank lines of comment.
 Perhaps this is down to some option in the formatter but I can't find it and I want my comments indented by a character, provided there is one.

May be unrelated, but I noted that if you hit return in a comment that doesn't have any trailing whitespace then the next line isn't indented either.
 This seems undesirable but I think padding comments with whitespace isn't a good solution, if indeed that's what's how this came about.
