Bug 108247 – 'Selected resources' scope disabled but 'Enclosing projects' possible
I20050823-0800
Open a CU and press Ctrl+H ==> the 'Selected resources' scope is disabled but
the 'Enlcosing projects' scope is not.
How can the projects be computed if the
selected resources are not known? ;-)
If an editor is active I would expect that the selected resources are the
resources specified by the editor input.
