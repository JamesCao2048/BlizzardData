Bug 262877 – The JavaModel object needs to be handled by the JavaNavigatorLabelProvider
With the addition of Go Into support in the Project Explorer, it is necessary to get the description of the JavaModel object (which is what the Package Explorer does in a hardwired manner).
 The Project Explorer cannot do something similar, and has to resolve it through the normal label provider mechanism.
A workaround was put in the ProjectExplorer class with bug 262606.
To remove the workaround, see the lines in the ProjectExplorer that refer to bug 262606 and remove them.
