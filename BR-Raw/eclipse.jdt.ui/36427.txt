Bug 36427 – org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.filters.NamePatternFilter should adapt to IJavaElement [general issue]
NamePatternFilter.select(...) checks whether the specified element is an
instance of IJavaElement.
If not, it attempts to adapt to an IResource.
It
should also attempt to adapt to IJavaElement.
