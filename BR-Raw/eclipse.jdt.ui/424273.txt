Bug 424273 – [1.8][clean up] Convert lambda to anonymous has problems with wildcards
Convert lambda to anonymous has problems with wildcards:
package xy;
import java.util.*;
public class E {
void foo(Integer[] ints){
Arrays.sort(ints, (i1, i2) -> i1 - i2);
Comparator<?> cw = (w1, w2) -> 0;
Comparator cr = (r1, r2) -> 0;
Comparator<? extends Number> ce = (n1, n2) -> -0;
};
}
