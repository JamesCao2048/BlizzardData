Bug 187316 – [preferences] Mark Occurences Pref Page; Link to
Build ID: 3.3M7
Steps To Reproduce:
There should be a link to the pref page on which you can change the color.
Namely: General/Editors/Text Editors/Annotations
It's a pain in the a** to find the pref if you do not know Eclipse's preference structure well.
