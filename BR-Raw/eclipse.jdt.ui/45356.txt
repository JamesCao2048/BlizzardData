Bug 45356 – [typing] IndentAction: Pressing Tab at document begin gives IAE
Build 200310150800:
Having a multi-line comment starting at document offset 0, the caret as well
at offset 0 and pressing tab, the indent action gives an IAE.
Reason: The constructor of status called at IndentAction#run() requires a non-
null message parameter.
The exception that was triggered in the first place
results from a taking the previous line of the first one.
