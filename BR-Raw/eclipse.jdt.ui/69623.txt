Bug 69623 – [hovering] Show why there's no Javadoc
Javadocs for methods, etc within the JRE display propery in the Javadoc View and in the code window
after appropriate delay; the external browser menu also works.
User libraries don't work in the first two
cases, only the external browser works...
(this confirms that the javadoc path is correct)
