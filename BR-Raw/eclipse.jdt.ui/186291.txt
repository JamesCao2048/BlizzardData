Bug 186291 – [build path] Output folder on source folders gets stripped when project established in IDE
When a .classpath file for a java project has different output folders for each source folder.
 e.g.:
<classpathentry kind="src" output="build/classes/core" path="core"/>
<classpathentry kind="src" output="build/classes/datamodel" path="build/datamodel"/>
<classpathentry kind="src" output="build/classes/dao" path="dao3"/>
<classpathentry kind="src" output="build/classes/app" path="app3"/>
<classpathentry kind="src" output="build/classes/dao" path="dao"/>
<classpathentry kind="src" output="build/classes/app" path="app"/>
<classpathentry kind="src" output="build/classes/web" path="web"/>
And the project is either:
1.
Committed to SVN and checked out into a new machine.
or
2.
Project created on a machine that has existing project contents in workspace but project not yet established/registered in package explorer.
The Eclipse strips out all of the output="" lines above and begins compiling all the source folders into the same output folder.
 After 1.
or 2.
above you need to revert the .classpath file to what it was before Eclipse mangled it then refresh the project in Eclipse - this restores it.
A feature we use widely and a gotcha that gets every developer.
 Keen to see if fixed.
