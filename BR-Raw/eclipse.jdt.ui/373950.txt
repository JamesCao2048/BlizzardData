Bug 373950 – [preferences] Getting recommendations about the null settings even if annotation-based null analysis is not enabled
Through the bug 371968, a popup was added to warn about lesser compiler setting than the setting for null annotation based analysis.
I am getting this popup even if the 'Enable annotation-based null analysis' is turned off.
I am using I20120306-0800.
