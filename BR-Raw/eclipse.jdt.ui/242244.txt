Bug 242244 – [extract interface] 'Extract interface' should offer to 'Generate @Override annotation'
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
In version 20050404, the 'Generate @Override annotation' has been removed.
See bug #89517.
However, this annotation changed and I think the option should now be added back.
