Bug 272334 – [quick assist] 'Replace conditional with if-else' should also work on VariableDeclarationFragment
Build ID: M20090211-1700
Provide a new refactoring:
Name: something like "convert if-else to ternary"
Precondition: an if-else statement is selected
Postcondition: the if statement is replaced by a ternary operator populated appropriately
Example: it would convert the following:
if( doInsert )
{
sql = INSERT_ADDRESS;
}
else
{
sql = UPDATE_ADDRESS;
}
to:
sql = doInsert ? INSERT_ADDRESS : UPDATE_ADDRESS;
