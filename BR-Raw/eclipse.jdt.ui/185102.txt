Bug 185102 – [actions] Assign Working Sets if there are no working sets
20070502
- start with a new workspace
- create a project
- invoke 'Assign Working Sets...'
- dialog shows up with nothing to select, no message, OK button enabled
- I think it would be better to show an information dialog that says:
'No Working Sets have been defined yet'
Maybe even offer a button to create a new working set.
