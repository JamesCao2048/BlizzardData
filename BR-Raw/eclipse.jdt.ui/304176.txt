Bug 304176 – [hashcode/equals] Generated equals() should use Arrays.deepEquals() instead of Arrays.equals()
Build Identifier:
I'm not sure what is the point of Arrays.equals() since it can fail to work properly for a number of cases, including three-dimensional arrays, as demonstrated in this example:
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int[][][] a = new int[][][] {{null}};
int[][][] b = new int[][][] {{null}};
System.out.println(Arrays.equals(a, b)); // false
System.out.println(Arrays.deepEquals(a, b)); // true
}
}
I believe Eclipse-generated equals() method should use Arrays.deepEquals() as it seems to be doing its job properly.
Reproducible: Always
