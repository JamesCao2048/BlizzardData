Bug 290913 – [JUnit] Testsuites created by New Testsuite-Wizard have a fix name
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier:
When creating a new TestSuite using the Wizard the generated suite-method creates a TestSuite with a fixed name:
TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("Test for fullyqualified.package.name");
It would be a nice feature when the testsuite were created by using the package name obtained through reflection:
TestSuite suite =  new TestSuite("Test for " + AllTests.class.getPackage().getName());
This way its junit-label is also changed when the suite is moved to another package.
Reproducible: Always
