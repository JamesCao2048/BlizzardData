Bug 391265 – [code templates] JavaDoc {@link} and @See are not generated correctly for generic method arguments
In JavaDoc blocks, {@link}s to methods in other classes, where the method takes a generic argument, are not identified correctly by (I assume) the parser, resulting in two observed bugs.
For example, given these classes:
---
package pk1;
public class A {
/**
* Generic
*/
public <T> void method(T t) {}
/**
* Generic array
*/
public <T> void method(T[] t) {}
}
---
package pk1;
/**
* {@link pk1.A#method(T)}.
* {@link pk1.A#method(T[])}.
*/
public class B {}
---
package pk2;
public class T {}
---
The following can be observed.
1.
 The ctrl+click navigation to the methods does not work.
 For class B you can navigate to class A directly, but there is no active link available for the methods.
2.
On origination of imports for class B, the import pk2.T; is brought in.
 (Additionally this effects the behavior of 1., ctrl+click will go to the correct methods, however the T becomes an active link to class T.)
