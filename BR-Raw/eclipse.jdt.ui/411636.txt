Bug 411636 – Save is very slow (burns cycles in the Package and Project Explorer)

Stack trace
I noticed that when I saved a Java file, the UI would be come unresponsive for about 5 seconds.
 I did a stack trace (attached) and noticed that the main thread seemed to be hung up somewhere in the project explorer.
 When I unchecked "Link With Editor" this delay went away.
I tried doing the same action on the exact same workspace in Indigo and did not notice the same delay.
 My workspace is very large (100+ projects, maybe 50-100K files).
I'm using:
Version: 4.3.0
Build id: I20130605-2000
