Bug 409717 – [hovering] Javadoc link to package doesn't work in attached package-info.java
The Javadoc in javax.lang.model's package-info.java (in attached source) contains: "{@linkplain javax.annotation.processing annotation processing}"
The parsing of this link fails in JavaElementLinks#parseURI(URI) because the
"if (element instanceof IPackageFragment)" branch only resolves types, but not packages.
We should use the same code as in "if (element instanceof IType)" to resolve a link to package as well.
Also need to check whether the Javadoc tool supports links to members.
If it does, then reuse that part of "if (element instanceof IType)" as well.
And last but not least, Javadocs of JavaElementLinks need to tell that refTypeName can also refer to a package.
