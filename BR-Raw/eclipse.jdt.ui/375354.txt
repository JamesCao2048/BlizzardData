Bug 375354 – toolbar button tool tips are not read by screen reader
While using either JAWS or NVDA:
1.
Open the Extract Constant dialog from the Refactor menu (the other options like that probably work too).
2.
Click Preview.
3.
Shift+Tab backwards, the top toolbar buttons are only read as "buttons", without an accessible label.
