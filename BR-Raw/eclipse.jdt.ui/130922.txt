Bug 130922 – [quick assist] 'Assign parameter to new field' must not make field final'
I20060307-1315
package xy;
public class Try{
public Try(String arg) {
}
public Try() {
}
}
Quick assist on 'arg' to assign to a new field
-> field is final, yielding a compile error
-> expected: field not final as it was in earlier builds
