Bug 266442 – [navigation] JavaElementImplementationHyperlink.open() must show dialog in case of error
HEAD.
In case of error JavaElementImplementationHyperlink.open() currently logs the error with "" as message.
This is not good:
- it must use an appropriate message
- it must show an ErrorDialog to the user
