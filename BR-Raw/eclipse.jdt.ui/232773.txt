Bug 232773 – [working sets] 'Assign Working Set... > New...' should pre-fill with selected elements
I20080516-1333
- select a few projects in Package Explorer
- context menu > 'Assign Working Set...
> New...
> Java'
=> expected: selected projects should already be in 'Working set content' list
=> was: list empty
Workaround is to create the working set without selecting anything and then check the working set in the 'Working Set Assignments' dialog.
