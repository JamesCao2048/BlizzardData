The filter "Empty parent packages" does not hide a parent package if it contains filtered .svn ressource folders.
So logically they are empty but the filter does not think that.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Check out a project from svn in Windows 7 with TortoriseSVN
2.
Import the project in eclipse (without using subclipse or subversive etc.)
3.
Enable the .ressources and empty parent packages filters
