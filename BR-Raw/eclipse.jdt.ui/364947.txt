Bug 364947 – [move method] The design of the Move Instance Method refactoring tool doesn't match users' expectations
Build Identifier: M20110909-1335
We have recently conducted an empirical study on the use of Eclipse refactoring tool using our custom data collector called CodingSpectator
<http://codingspectator.cs.illinois.edu/>.
We studied the refactoring activities of 26 programmers for a total of about 1400 hours of programming.
See our technical report <http://hdl.handle.net/2142/27730> for more details.
One of the findings of our study was that our participants were not able to use the Move Instance Method refactoring tool.
We investigated the invocations of this refactoring and asked some of our participants about their use of it.
As a result, we found a mismatch between how users expected the Move Instance Method refactoring tool to work and the current design of the tool.
In the following, I'll briefly describe the current current design of the Move Instance Method refactoring in Eclipse, explain the problems of our participants with this design, and finally propose a few alternatives to mitigate these problems.
Reproducible: Always
