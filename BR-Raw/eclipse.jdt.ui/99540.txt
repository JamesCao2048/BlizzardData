Bug 99540 – [javadoc export] javadoc: locale argument must come first
To reproduce:
Project -> Generate Javadoc -> Next -> Next ...
Now in the "Extra Javadoc options" put "-locale jp".
 Click Finish.
 Javadoc
complains that the "option -locale must be first on the command line," although
in fact it is the only argument.
