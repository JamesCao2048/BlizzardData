Bug 81856 – quote problems in property files (JDT)
Our automated tool, chkpii, has detected a number of problems with quote
handling in java property files being processed by the MessageFormat class.
These problems need to be fixed in the english property files before they are
sent for translation, and the bug is propogated to the translated version as
well.
 I'm including info from the tool on how to fix the problems for those
who are outside of ibm and may not have access to it.
In addition, when we process the files we add the line:
# NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR
to the beginning of each file.
 This insturcts chkpii on how we are handling
property strings in the code.

918 Found 1 single quote in text handled by Java MessageFormat class.

Description:
In November, 2004, the translation process changed to allow development to
indicate whether the message text will be processed by the Java MessageFormat
class or not.
If the text will be processed by MessageFormat, then all single
quotes in the text must be doubled in order for the end user to see one single
quote.
MessageFormat assumes that the single quote character is an escape
character.
A single quote has been found which is not immediately followed by
another single quote ('), a left brace ({), or a right brace (}).
Possible causes are:
The developer incorrectly coded the English text.
The single quote should have
been coded as 2 consecutive single quotes because the text will be processed by
MessageFormat.
The translator incorrectly entered a single quote in the text and the
translation tools did not double this character.
The wrong NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_xxx comment is in effect for this text.
This has
caused CHKPII to check for the wrong usage of single quotes.
The NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR comment is in effect for this text which incorrectly
contains a replacement variable.
When the text contains replacement variables,
NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR indicates that all single quotes must exist as 2
consecutive single quotes.
When this message is listed as a warning (W), then the IBMJDK21 set of markup
tables was used to translate this file, which assumes that
NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR is the default process.
A single quote exists in text
which contains a replacement variable, and possibly should be doubled.
Action:
Locate the listed line number in the file and locate the incorrectly coded
single quote.
If the text will be processed by MessageFormat, then change the one single
quote (') to 2 consecutive single quotes ('').
Consider using a different character if this will not change the meaning of the
text (like double quote ("), parenthesis (), bracket []).
If the wrong NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_xxx comment is in effect, contact development to
determine if a different comment should be used for this text.
If the NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR comment is in effect and the text contains text
which is interpreted as a replacement variable, check the English to determine
if a variable should exist in this text or not.
Remove it if it should not be
in this text.
If the lab instructed you to use IBMJDK21, then change the one single quote (')
to 2 consecutive single quotes ('').
Otherwise, determine if IBMJDK11 should
have been used to analyze this file or verify that 1 single quote is
appropriate in this text.

process) and 2 consecutive single quotes exist in the text and possibly should
not be doubled.
Action:
Locate the listed line number in the file and locate the incorrectly coded
single quote.
If the text will not be processed by MessageFormat, then change the 2
consecutive single quotes ('') to 1 single quote (').
