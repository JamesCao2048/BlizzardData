Bug 62062 – Mark Occurrences annotation text is not interesting as Tooltip Description
I20040512-0800
Mark Occurrences annotation is not interesting as Tooltip Description.
Steps:
- enable Mark Occurrences
- set caret to a variable and wait until occurrences marked
- hover over variable or press F2
-> expected: type, name and javadoc
-> was: only name (I guess this is the Annotation's text)
