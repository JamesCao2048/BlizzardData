Bug 217126 – [performance] Too many performance tests have only one measure
Looking at the Scenario Status Table of the JDT/UI component performance tests, it  appears that most of the tests have only one run (eg.
standard error = '[n/a]').
This has a strong impact on the tests reliability and make the verification hard to be accurate.
The global result is that no regression was noticed on this component although the fingerprints looks not so good; a large number of tests in the fingerprints are red or yellow.
IMO, this may give to users a negative feeling about the global performance of this component although there's no real performance issue...
