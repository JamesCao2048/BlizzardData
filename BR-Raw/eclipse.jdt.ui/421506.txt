Bug 421506 – Suggestion to align "Additional Save actions" with the desired code Eclipse contribution guidelines
Created attachment 237386 [details]
Setting
I think most Eclipse projects (at least Eclipse platform, EGit and e4) ask their contributors to remove trailing whitespace from their contributions.
I suggest to add "Remove trailing white space on all lines" to the default Additional save actions.
I also think that "Use modifier final where possible" for private fields is currently not desired by the Eclipse projects.
This would result in setting similar to the attached screenshot.
Would JDT accept a patch for this change?
