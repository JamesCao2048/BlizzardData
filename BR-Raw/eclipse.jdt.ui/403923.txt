Bug 403923 – [1.8] Handle annotations on extra dimensions in the AST
Handle annotations on extra dimensions in the AST.
For jsr308, a new extraDimensions2 property has been added to MethodDeclaration and to the two concrete VariableDeclaration types.
Make a pass over all JDT UI code that uses the old property in any way (direct access or via property descriptor) and update usages.
File separate bugs if things get too complicated somewhere or if you think we should add new features for handling these constructs.
