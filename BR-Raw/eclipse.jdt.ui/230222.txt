Bug 230222 – [breadcrumb] unfocused dropdown not closed when leaving workbench window
I20080502-0100
- show breadcrumb
- click on an item (not on triangle)
- switch to another application (Alt+Tab or click into another window)
=> dropdown is not closed (is only closed when workbench window gets focus again)
Currently not a big issue, but becomes severe when dropdown gets the SWT.ON_TOP bit.
