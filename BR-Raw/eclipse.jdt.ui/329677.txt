I use package name abbreviation to make it easier to parse information in Java views, and to reduce clutter.
But Type Hierarchy view does not respect this setting...
this is irritating
(Call Hierarchy works correctly)
Steps
- Enable 'Show qualified type names' from the Type Hierarchy view menu
- Enable package name abbreviation
- Open type hierarchy on something
