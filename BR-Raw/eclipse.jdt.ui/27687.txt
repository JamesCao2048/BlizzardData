Bug 27687 – Jar export: Cannot export java project as a jar when manifest file is present
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Create a java project
2.
Create a simple folder in your project.
 Call it "META-INF".
3.
Create a simple file in the META-INF folder.
 Call it "MANIFEST.MF".
4.
In the context menu of your java project, click "Export" and select JAR
file.
5.
Fill in the export destination path and click Next.
6.
Click Next again to go to the JAR Manifest Specification page of the wizard.
The same thing happens whether you choose "Generate the manifest file" or "Use
existing manifest from workspace" and select the file, then click Finish.
 The
popup appears:
Confirm Replace
The file 'E:\eclipse_workbench\eclipse\workspace\Test.jar' already exists.
