Bug 318772 – [build path] help button on "Inclusion and Exclusion Patterns" wizard page does not work
The help button shown as a question mark icon on the "Inclusion and Exclusion Patterns" page of the "Edit source folder" wizard does not work when clicked.
 However, the previous page titled, "Source Folder" does work.
Steps to duplicate:
* Create a new Java project.
* Open the project's properties.
* Navigate to Java Build Path.
* Click "Add Folder".
* Choose a path and click next.
* On the "Inclusion and Exclusion Patterns" page, click the help button in the lower-left corner.
Actual behavior:
* Nothing happens.
Expected behavior:
* Help side-bar panel opens on the right side of the page.
