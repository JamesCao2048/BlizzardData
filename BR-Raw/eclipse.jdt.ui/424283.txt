Bug 424283 – [1.8][hovering] Support showing Javadoc for JavaFX properties
This might sound a bogus request but is something that really happens as part of OracleJDK where you have source code that look like this:
/**
* Called when there is an external request to close this {@code Window}.
* The installed event handler can prevent window closing by consuming the
* received event.
*/
private ObjectProperty<EventHandler<WindowEvent>> onCloseRequest;
public final void setOnCloseRequest(EventHandler<WindowEvent> value) {
onCloseRequestProperty().set(value);
}
public final EventHandler<WindowEvent> getOnCloseRequest() {
return (onCloseRequest != null) ? onCloseRequest.get() : null;
}
public final ObjectProperty<EventHandler<WindowEvent>>
onCloseRequestProperty() {
and generated JavaDoc like this:
http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/stage/Window.html#setOnCloseRequest%28javafx.event.EventHandler%29 which is implemented through https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-7112427
i'm not sure how to solve this.
Possible solutions:
* teach JDT the property API - if no docs found search for a variable with the same name
* if no javadoc is found on the method - fall back to the HTML-JavaDoc
