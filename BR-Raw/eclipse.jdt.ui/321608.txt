Bug 321608 – [JUnit] New JUnit 4 Test Case wizard is confusing without class under test
I20100802-1800
Steps:
1) File -> New JUnit Test Case -> choose New JUnit 4 Test (say Test1) in the radio button
=> the super class field is uneditable
2) Enter other values and Finish
3) Open the New JUnit Test Suite wizard : File -> New JUnit Test Suite
=> The new test Test1 case does not appear in the list of 'Test classes to include in suite'
4) Open the Test1 class and add the superclass as junit.framework.TestCase
and repeat step (3) it appears now in the list
