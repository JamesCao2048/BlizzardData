Bug 85850 – ASTRewrite does not consider length from TargetSourceRangeComputer when removing node from list
I20050217-2000
ASTRewrite does not consider the length from its TargetSourceRangeComputer when
removing an ASTNode from a list.
Applying the Inline Constant refactoring on CONSTANT also removes the comment
before the method declaration, even though the TargetSourceRangeComputer tells
it to only remove the FieldDeclaration.
I guess the problem is in
ASTRewriteAnalyzer.ListRewriter#rewriteList(ASTNode,
StructuralPropertyDescriptor, int, String), where the start of the next node is
used to determine the end of the section to delete
(ASTRewriteAnalyzer:542, rev.
1.20)
public class A {
private static final int CONST = 9;
/*
* (non-Javadoc) comment deleted by inline constant CONST
*/
public void foo() {
final int lineNumber2= CONST;
}
}
