Bug 321592 – [quick fix] Dead code fix forget that conditional has a special way to compute resulting type
Build Identifier: I20100706-0800
If a dead code appears in a conditional, the fix can generate the wrong code
because conditonal use the type of the two branches to compute the resulting type.
In the following code, eclipse rightly detects that new Double(0, 0) is a
dead code but when fix it, it wrongly assume that there is no conversion.
The result should be a double (conditional does unboxing see JLS3 15.25).
Object o = true ? new Integer(1) : new Double(0.0);
//Object o = new Integer(3); // wrong fix done by eclipse
//Object o = 1.0   // correct fix
System.out.println(o);
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
run the snippet of code and fix the dead code.
