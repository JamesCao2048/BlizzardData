Bug 463332 – [1.8][quick fix] No quick fix to resolve 'default method conflicts' error
public interface Interface1 {
public default void x() {
//...
}
}
public interface Interface2 {
public void x();
}
//The below class has an compile error because it must pick which x() to inherit.
public abstract class Helper implements Interface1, Interface2 {
}
There doesn't seem to be a quick fix for this.
I was expecting to see a menu with a few options:
1.
Override x() completely (empty body with TODO statement, this is like redefining the method).
2.
Override x() by using the default implementation in Interface1 (Interface1.super.x();).
In fact, Eclipse would not code-complete this code.
I'll file another bug for that.
