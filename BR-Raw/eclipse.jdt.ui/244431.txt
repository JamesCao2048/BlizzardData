Bug 244431 – [preferences] Outgoing change to preferences when no change made
Created attachment 110226 [details]
Outgoing changes after not modifying anything
Build: I20080807-1402
1) Checkout this project from CVS:
/cvsroot/rt/org.eclipse.equinox/p2/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.tests
2) Open the Properties dialog on the project
3) Click or arrow down to visit each of the JDT property pages
4) Click OK to close the dialog without modifying anything
Expected: No outgoing changes to preference files since I didn't modify anything
Actual: Both jdt.core.prefs and jdt.ui.prefs have outgoing changes.
I will attach a patch showing all the outgoing changes.
