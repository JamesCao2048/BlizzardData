Bug 368452 – Full rebuild is asked on compiler options changed even when workspace is empty
Build Identifier: Version: Indigo Service Release 1 Build id: 20110916-0149
When a compiler option has been changed (through Preferences / Java / Compiler / Errors/Warnings), a dialog box appears and tells you that â€œThe Error/Warning settings have changedâ€? and that â€œA full rebuild is required for changes to take effectâ€? and asks you if you want to â€œDo the full build nowâ€?.
The question should not be asked when the workspace contains no project to possibly rebuild.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Grab a fresh eclipse install.
(Optional, but just to be sure.)
2.
Start eclipse, pointing it to a blank, new workspace directory.
(So that it starts with no projects.)
3.
Go straight to Preferences, change some Java compiler option, e.g., ask for â€œInclude 'assert' in null analysisâ€?.
Click Apply or OK.
