Bug 215473 – [navigation] Show more then one hyperlink per modifier key
I20080108-1320
If more then one hyperlink exist on a given position only the first detected hyperlink is opened when clicking on the hyperlink region.
Which one the first is is not specified.
If we detect more then one hyperlink we should:
- Show each in a hover, the user can open each one when clicking on it in the hover
- Allow to specify on the preference page which hyperlink is opened when clicking on the hyperlink region (the default hyperlink)
