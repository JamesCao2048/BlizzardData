Bug 374605 – Unreasonable warning for enum-based switch statements
With 3.8M6 the following code produces the warning "The switch on the enum type Test.TestEnum should have a default case".
Why is default case necessary if all enum values are covered by the switch?
public class Test {
private static enum TestEnum { ONE, TWO }
public void test(TestEnum p) {
switch (p) {
case ONE:
break;
case TWO:
break;
}
}
}
The warning is new in M6 and was not present in M5.
