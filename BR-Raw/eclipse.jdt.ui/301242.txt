The UI can be locked up by 2 dialogs when the user repeatedly performs Undo in a Java editor with the 'Format all' Save Action enabled.
My test case:
- check out org.eclipse.ui.workbench
- open class SearchPattern, go to validateMatchRule(..)
- add spaces at the beginning of a few lines
- press Ctrl+S
- add more spaces at the beginning of a few lines
- press Ctrl+S again
- press and hold Ctrl+Z
