Bug 314283 – [package explorer][render] Decorator on CUs for deprecated and package-visible
Build Identifier: 20100318-1801
In the Preferences window (General->Appearance->Label Decorations) user can set a check-box "Java Type Indicator".
If the box is checked, small icons appear in the Package Explorer: I (interface), A (abstract), E (enum).
I propose the following extensions:
1) (more important).
Add check-box "Java Deprecated Decorator" which means that deprecated classes will be highlighted somehow in Package Explorer.
At once I can imagine 3 variants a) strike-out; b) italic; c) diagonal line like in Outline.
As for me, (a) strike-out is the best variant (if the name of a class remains readable).
2) (less important).
Add the check-box "Java Throwable Indicator/Decorator"  for Throwable and possibly for abstract Throwable (because Throwable can be abstract also).
It can be a) Indicator, so small icon will be shown for Throwable (maybe letter "T" and letters "AT" for abstract one).
Or b) Decorator and the name of the class become italic for example (if deprecated decorator is not italic) or something like this.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Open Package Explorer.
