Bug 330680 – Refactoring Signature Preview bg color is changed to default, hard to read with light syntax coloring
Build Identifier: M20100909-0800
ExtractMethodInputPage, line 314.
This explicitly sets the background color of the signature preview text widget to be the same as the parent composite, which is going to the be standard gray.
 If the user has set up preference in such a way that they use light fg colors on top of a dark bg color for their Java syntax coloring, this makes the preview very hard to read.
This particular "bug" is also in any other Refactoring action that provides a signature preview on the first page of the dialog.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Set a black bg and white fg in Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors
2.
Create a simple hello world Java file.
3.
Try to Refactor > Extract Method a line of code.
