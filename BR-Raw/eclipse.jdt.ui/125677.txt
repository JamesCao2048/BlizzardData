Bug 125677 – [navigation] @category not standing out enough in outliner
Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20060125-0800
I find the the @category tag not standing out enough in outline view.
e.g.
SomeType
+- method1() : int
+- method2() : int
+- method3() : int
+- accessor - getX() : int
+- accessor - getY() : int
+- SOME_CONSTANT : String
Visually, the grouping doesn't appear much.
- Could it be emphasized, maybe offering some grouping ? (with intermediate
node?)
- Maybe the sorting button should offer a mode where it is combining items in same categories together (at least sorting them next to each other).
- Maybe using a bullet with a custom colour for a category ? (items in same category get a bullet of same colour?).
