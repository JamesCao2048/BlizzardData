Bug 25324 – Ability to know when tests are finished [junit]
Hi,
I'm writing a Cactus Plugin that extends the JUnit Plugin and I need to know
when the tests have finished running in the TestRunner.
There is a nice
ITestRunListener interface for that.
My idea was thus to implement this
interface and somehow register my listener to the TestRunner
(RemoteTestRunnerClient).
However:
1/ Currently the RemoteTestRunnerClient implementation only supports one
listener
2/ There is no API in TestRunnerViewPart to get access to the TestRunner
I am attaching a patch that should provide this facility.
However, I need your
help to know if this is the right approach or not.
Thank you
-Vincent
