Bug 290034 – Effects of @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") are broader in Eclipse than in javac
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Eclipse seems to overload "unchecked" warning suppression to also suppress raw uses of parameterized classes.
 Javac doesn't issue a warning in this case so there's nothing to suppress.
 However this does pose an issue when working with other IDE's as they will complain about the use of a raw parameterized class.
 The following snippet illustrates the difference:
public class Foo<T> {
//This is unchecked assignment
//and should be suppressed using "unchecked"
//This will appear as a warning in javac
Foo<T>[] a = new Foo[10];
//This is raw use of a paramterized type
//Not suppressed in javac using "unchecked"
//This will NOT appear as a warning in javac
Foo[] b = new Foo[10];
}
The workaround is to declare b with a wildcard, e.g.:
Foo<?>[] b = new Foo[10];
Reproducible: Always
