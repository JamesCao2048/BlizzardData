Bug 388342 – [type wizards] Main Method Stub Check Box in the Class Wizard Stays Checked the Next Time It Loads
Back in version 3.7 of the Eclipse Java IDE, when you checked the box "public static void main(String[] args)", it would generate the main method, but the next time you created a class with the wizard, that box would not be checked.
Now that I am using version 4.2, I am noticing that the check box stays checked.
This is annoying because most of the time, when creating a class, you don't need a main.
It is a special case.
So the default should be unchecked, not whatever the previous state of the box was.
It would be nice if the behaviour returned to the original, that is, that the box always starts out as unchecked.
