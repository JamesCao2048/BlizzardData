Bug 59891 – [formatter] improve lines wrapping in nested method calls
Build 3.0M8
I'm using the Code formatter with the Java Conventions profile (with only the
maximum line width changed to 40 characters) to format this class:
public class Main {
public static void main(
String[] args) {
foo(bar(1, 2, 3), baz(4, 5, 6, 7));
}
}
The result looks like this:
public class Main {
public static void main(
String[] args) {
foo(bar(1, 2, 3), baz(4, 5, 6,
7));
}
}
I was expecting something like this:
public class Main {
public static void main(
String[] args) {
foo(bar(1, 2, 3),
baz(4, 5, 6, 7));
}
}
The formatter should break the line in  between the calls to bar and baz, so
that each line can be read by itself (almost).
In general, this means that lines
should be broken at the highest level possible.
Btw, I've noticed that lines with arithmetic expressions are already split this
way, so subexpressions contained in paranthesis are usually kept on the same
line.
Witth the same settings, the following code:
public class Main {
public static void main(
String[] args) {
int a = (1 + 2 + 3) + (4 + 5 + 6 + 7);
}
}
gets formatted like this:
public class Main {
public static void main(
String[] args) {
int a = (1 + 2 + 3)
+ (4 + 5 + 6 + 7);
}
}
