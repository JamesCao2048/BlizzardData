Bug 262748 – [jar exporter] extract constants for string literals in JarRsrcLoader et al.
HEAD
The code in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.jarpackagerfat is hard to maintain because relevant string literals are spread and duplicated in various classes, e.g.
JarRsrcLoader, RsrcURLStreamHandler, FatJarRsrcUrlAntExporter, FatJarRsrcUrlManifestProvider, etc.
String literals like "Rsrc-Main-Class", "rsrc" (the URL protocol), etc.
should be extracted into constants and moved into a few selected classes.
Coordinate this with bug 262746 (move redistributable classes into a separate source folder).
