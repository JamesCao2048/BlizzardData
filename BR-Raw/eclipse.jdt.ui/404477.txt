Bug 404477 – [move method] Wrong detection of duplicate methods (can result in compile errors)
Here is the original source code:
public class A {
public int i = 0;
public void m(B b) {
i++;
}
}
public class B {
public void m() {
}
}
When method m of A is moved to B by applying move-refactoring,
Eclipse error occurs saying that "A method with name 'm' already exists in the target type 'B'.
But it should not be an error since method m will have different parameters in B:
public class B {
public void m() {
}
public void m(A a) {
a.i++;
}
}
