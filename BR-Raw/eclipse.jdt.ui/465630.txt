Bug 465630 – [JUnit] "Next/Previous Failed Test" buttons enabled on "Show Skipped Tests Only"
When Show Skipped Tests Only (bug 298603) is enabled in the JUnit view, the "Next/Previous Failed Test" buttons don't work any more.
They are enabled if the test run session had errors, and they are disabled if all non-skipped tests are green.
They at least need to be disabled when they don't work.
A better solution would be to change them to "Next/Previous Skipped Test" in that case.
