Bug 261198 – nodes missing in Java Model in Synchronize view
I have a project with the following structure:
123 (project shared using CVS)
+- src (source folder)
+- somebusiness
+- some-business
|  +- file1.txt
+-file2.txt
Now when I make changes only to file1.txt and do "Team->Synchronize with Repository", I don't see the file1.txt, only:
123
+- src
But when I make changes to file2.txt, in "Team->Synchronize with Repository"
I see that both file1.txt and file2.txt have changed.
This problem was originally spotted on Eclipse 3.2.2, but appears still on 3.5M4.
So far I had traced it to org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.model.JavaSynchronizationContentProvider
