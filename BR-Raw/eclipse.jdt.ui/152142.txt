Bug 152142 – [nls] the NLS key tab is not available in the search dialog window
In Eclipse 3.2, the NLS key tab is not available in the search dialog window.
It is not listed in the 'Customize...' list either.
It is still documented in Eclipse 3.2 doc but the corresponding class
NLSSearchPage is no longer part of the o.e.jdt.ui plugin (org.eclipse.jdt.ui_3.2.0.v20060605-1400.jar)
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/ui%20refactoring/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/ui/refactoring/nls/search/Attic/NLSSearchPage.java
It seems that the documentation is not up to date but in doubt, I open this bug
in UI since the new actions related to NLS keys does not cover all the
functionalities which were availbale in the NLS search page.
