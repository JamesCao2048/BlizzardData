Bug 330057 – [call hierarchy] Improve 'Remove from view' action's UI
Created attachment 182957 [details]
screenshot
See attached screenshot of context menus of Call Hierarchy view and Search View
2 things..
1) 'Remove from view' should use the same icon as the one is search view
2) The placement of this action is inconsistent with the Search view.
In Search view the action is placed along with Copy actions, but in Call Hierarchy view it is not.
(I am fine if this is fixed in the Search view, I just want the placement to be consistent)
