Bug 395228 – [introduce indirection] Adds unneccessary import when inner class is used as parameter in surrounding class
Steps to reproduce:
1.
Invoke "Introduce Indirection" on 'f' method in code below
2.
The resulting file does not compile ("The type IntroduceIndirectionBug1.C is not visible")
class IntroduceIndirectionBug1 {
// Invoke "Introduce Indirection" on 'f'
void f(C c) {
}
private class C {
}
}
The cause of this bug is probably the same as for bug 394725.
