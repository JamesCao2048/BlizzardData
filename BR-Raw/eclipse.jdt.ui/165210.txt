Bug 165210 – Fup of bug 74997, add new formatter option for number of blank lines between import groups
Right now the number of blank lines added by the fix for bug 74997 are not preserved once the code is formatted.
We should add a new code formatter option that specifies the number of blank lines between import groups.
This should take precedence over the number of blank lines to preserve.
If we don't do this, we end up with inconsistencies between the organize import operation and the code formatter.
