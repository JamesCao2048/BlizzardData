Bug 342858 – [inline] inlining all invocations of a method does not work for method with non-final enum type
Build Identifier: M20110210-1200
Not always, but often, selecting a method and inlining "All invocations" of it does not work.
 If you have "Delete method declaration" selected, that does take affect, leaving all the callers referring to a now deleted method, and thus compilation breaks.
There are no errors from the refactoring itself, it just fails silently.
I'm marking this Major, I think of this as being a critical refactoring.
 It's necessary whenever a change to a method is more than just a signature change.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Inline CouponChoice.getFrequency().
2.
See the caller not change.
