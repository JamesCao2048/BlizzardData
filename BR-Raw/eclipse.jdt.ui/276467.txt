Bug 276467 – [quick assist] Extract local variable extracts only one term when part of a sum is selected
Build ID: I20090430-2300
Steps To Reproduce:
In a Java editor:
int a = 1;
int b = 1;
int c = 1;
int d = a + b + c;
Select "a + b" and do quick assist -> Extract to local variable.
 The result:
<snip>
int a2 = a;
int d = a2 + b + c;
I'd hoped for "int i = a + b;" which is what I get from the Refactor menu.
