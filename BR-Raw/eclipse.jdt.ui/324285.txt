Bug 324285 – [JUnit] RemoteTestRunnerClient destroys line delimiters
3.6 and HEAD.
It took me quite a while to figure out why some of my tests failed until I noticed that the only difference were in the line delimiters.
Test Case:
1.
paste this source:
--- %< ---
import junit.framework.TestCase;
public class C extends TestCase {
public void test1() {
String s1= "a\nb";
String s2= "a\r\nb";
assertEquals(s2, s1);
}
}
--- %< ---
2.
fix build path
3.
run it as JUnit Test
4.
compare the failing string result
==> no diffs found and different line delimiters are not visible.
JUnit delivers the correct results but the reader in RemoteTestRunnerClient hard-codes the line delimiters to '\n'.
