Bug 88195 – [navigation] Type ahead search in quick outline should prefer enclosing type
If there is an inner class which has a method name starting with the same
prefix as a method in the enclosing class, the type-ahead matching in the
popup outline should give precedence to the enclosing type.
 Currently it
selects the first match based on the trees sorting.
Or, if the caret is currently inside the inner class, then that class' method
should have higher precedence.
Also, the tree should be completely expanded.
I'm looking at a Type with 2
nested types.
 All 3 types have a method called "translate", but only one of
the two nested types is expanded.
