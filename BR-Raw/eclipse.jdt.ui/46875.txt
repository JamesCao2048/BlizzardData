Bug 46875 ñ [typing] Tabs are messed up
When I type code that has string literals in it, and press enter to move the
string literal to the next line, the tab logic seems strange.
e.g.
String twoLines =
"System Contains Many Defects,Systemet inneh√•ller m√•nga
fel\n"+"Stories Are Too Complicated,Stories √§r f√∂r komplicerade";
Move the cursor after + and press enter.
It somehow moves the new line to column 0, while I'd expect it to align with
the first line.
If you try this with a single string, the bug will still be
seen.
Interestingly, when I am within a method's parantheses, the behavior is
different.
e.g.
assertEquals(
"converted data",
"Systemet+inneh√•ller+m√•nga+fel|Stories+√§r+f√∂r+komplicerade",convertedData
.toString()
);
Note, the two lines within have a single tab each.
Now position the cursor on
convertedData and press enter - while I'd expect it to line up with the
previous line (two tabs), the IDE adds three tabs.
Now here's the one which really annoys me:
assertEquals(
There is one tab before assertEquals.
Press enter after the paranthesis.
Three tabs are inexplicably put in.
I would
expect only two.
I am assuming these are bugs as previous releases had the right behavior.
