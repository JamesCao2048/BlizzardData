Bug 82204 – [key binding] Shortcut for "Open Declaration" doesn't show in context menu of Java Editor
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050104-1600
When you open the context menu of a java element (in the java perspective) no
shortcut for Open Declaration is shown.
 The keybindings preference page shows
the Open Declaration action as being bound to F3.
 Pressing F3 correctly invokes
the action.
