Bug 272532 – [clean up] "Use modifier 'final' where possible" can introduce compile errors
Build ID: I20090313-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create a class with a private field and a constructor that can return before assigning to said field.
 e.g.
class Choo
{
private int a;
Choo(int b)
{
if (1 == b)
return;
a = 2;
}
}
2.
Source -> Cleanup..
3.
Ensure Code Style -> Variable declarations -> Use modifier 'final' where possible -> Private fields is ticked.
4.
Run the clean-up.
'final' will be added to the private field (a), which will cause the constructor to error: "The blank final field a may not have been initialized"
Can work around this by putting in the implicit "=0;" on the private field.
