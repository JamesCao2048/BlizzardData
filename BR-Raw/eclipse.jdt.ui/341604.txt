Bug 341604 – Add constant or helper for indenting dependent controls
1.0.
Controls that depend on a parent control (e.g.
check box) are indented.
In most cases people use the commonly known value (20) and hard-code it.
A few wrongly use IDialogConstants.INDENT as pixel value but that constant is defined as dialog units.
For 3.8 we should define a new constant and fix the code that hard-codes 20.
