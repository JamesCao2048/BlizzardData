Bug 437847 – [type hierarchy] invoking Quick Type Hierarchy between import declarations yields an error
Attempting to trigger Quick Type Hierarchy (Ctrl+T) on a blank line (or a line containing only comments) between two import declarations results in an empty Quick Type Hierarchy popup and an Error event in the log.
I would expect Quick Type Hierarchy triggered in this location either
a) to display the type hierarchy of the compilation unit's main type, as is done when QTH is triggered on other blank lines,
b) to display the type hierarchy of one of the adjacent imports, or
c) to do nothing (show no popup)
I've attached a minimal Java file where this issue occurs.
I've reproduced this on 4.3.2 and 4.4.RC4.
Here are the Event Details for the event that gets logged:
Severity:
Error
Message:
Element unsupported by the hierarchy: class org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.ImportContainer
Exception Stack Trace:
