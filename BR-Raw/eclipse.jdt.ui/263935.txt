Bug 263935 – [compare] compare holds on to deleted compilation unit
build I20090203-1200
1) checkout org.eclipse.jdt.core
2) add a type org.eclipse.jdt.core.ZZZ.java
3) select org.eclipse.jdt.core and synchronize with the repository
4) from the synchronize view open ZZZ.java in compare editor
5) in the synchronize view select ZZZ.java and do 'Override and Update'
6) do ctrl+shift+T and type ZZZ
ZZZ.java appear
7) try to open ZZZ.java
an error window appear
The deleted type is also still visible in the package explorer
The problem does not occur if i do not open ZZZ.java in compare editor.
The problem is caused by a workingcopy of ZZZ.java which was not discarded.
