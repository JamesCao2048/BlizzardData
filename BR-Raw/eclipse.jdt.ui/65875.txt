Bug 65875 – [extract local] puts declaration at wrong position
Extract Local Variable puts the declaration at a wrong position iff
- the selected expression is in an ExpressionStatement, and
- there's a matching fragment before the selected expression
public class ExpressionStatement {
void m() {
System.out.println(calculateCount());
calculateCount(); //Extract Local Variable
}
private int calculateCount() {
return 1;
}
}
The declaration is created at the position of the ExpressionStatement instead of
before the first matching fragment.
The fix is very local and the code to
determine the right position is already there and can be reused.
