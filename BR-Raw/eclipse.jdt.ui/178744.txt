Bug 178744 – [misc] Editor opened upon an out of sync resource should allow for refresh action
I20070320-0010
Scenario:
- create new file test.txt in project P;
- edit it;
- leave Eclipse;
- touch test.txt;
- launch Eclipse;
- answer 'No' to the 'File Changed' prompt;
- you get your editor to display 'Resource is out of sync...';
- while refreshing it from the Navigator is easy, I found no means to refresh the resource from the editor itself, which I find non intuitive.
Note: that behavior is somewhat general and other scenarios enable to display the file contents instead of the 'Resource is out of sync...' disclaimer, for which a contextual menu is available, but that menu has no refresh item.
Checked behavior for Linux and XP.
