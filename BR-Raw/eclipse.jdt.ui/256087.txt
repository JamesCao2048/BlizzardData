Bug 256087 – [typing] Automatically close brace does not work properly
Build I20081118-1720.
I have the following simple line of code:
if (condition) return false;
I want to insert brace around the single statement of the if  block.
For this, I only type a brace just before the return and simply hit 'Enter':
if (condition) {return false;
As my Java editor preference 'Automatically close {braces}' is checked,
I would expect to get the following code:
if (condition) {
return false;
}
But I get the following code instead:
if (condition) {
}return false;
As this code does not compile, it's a little bit annoying...
