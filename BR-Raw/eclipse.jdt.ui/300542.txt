Bug 300542 – [build path] user library dialog should allow to select JAR from workspace
Build Identifier:
When adding a jar to a user library, you are give the dialog for selecting a file with an external path.
When attaching the source attachment or native library location you can select either an external path or a workspace path.
It would be useful to also be able to specify the jar location as a workspace path, which would aid in sharing projects with other people.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Open preferences, navigate to Java -> Build Path -> User Libraries
2.
Click New, and enter a name for the User Library.
3.
Click "Add JARs", note the dialog type.
4.
Select the "Native libary location" element, click "Edit".
5.
Note the dialog type which allows for choosing an External Folder or Workspace path.
