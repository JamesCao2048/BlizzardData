Bug 333541 – [preferences] "Show whitespace characters" gets toggled when "whitespace characters" dialog is opened
Build Identifier: 20101216-1529
Using eclipse-java-indigo-M4-linux-gtk
When you click on the "whitespace characters" link to open the "Show Whitespace Characters" dialog, then checkbox is always toggled
For the use case of someone enabling the option, that works fine - click the link, tweak the options in the dialog, close and the option is enabled
However, if the option is already enabled and you just want to tweak the options, it gets really annoying - click the link, tweak the options, close and notice the option is now disabled
Suggest that the the checkbox should never be toggled from on to off by clicking on this link
For reference, the option was added by bug #257313
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
In Preferences -> General -> Text Editors
2.
Click the "whitespace characters" link and get the "Show Whitespace Characters" dialog
3.
Notice the checkbox has been toggled
