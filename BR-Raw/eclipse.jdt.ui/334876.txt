Bug 334876 – [quick assist] Invert conditions generates incorrect code
Build Identifier: 20100917-0705
Let a and b be of Object type, the following expression:
a == null ^ b == null
is inverted incorrectly to:
!a == null ^ b == null
which does not compile (The operator ! is undefined for the argument type(s) Object).
The correct result should be:
a != null ^ b == null
It seems, that left-hand side argument is simply prefixed with !, but it should be recursively inverted as a separate expression.
Reproducible: Always
