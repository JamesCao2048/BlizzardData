Bug 13243 – [Browsing] package remains if all types are deleted
1) open Java Browsing Perspective
2) select a package
3) select all types of this package
4) delete all types, agree to also delete the compilation units
-> package still in the package list
5) deselect and reselect the project
-> package is no longer in package list
