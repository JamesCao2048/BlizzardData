I20090310-0100
Have Package Explorer in working set mode, sorted.
Change the name of a working set via context menu > Properties.
=> Working sets are not sorted alphabetically any more in the Package Explorer.
Open the Configure Working Sets dialog and edit a working set's name
=> Working sets are not sorted alphabetically any more in the dialog.
