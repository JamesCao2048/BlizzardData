Follow up on Bug 297442
File -> New -> Source Folder -> Browse - select a virtual folder => Wizard
shows an error 'Source folder cannot be a virtual folder.' : good
Java Build Path -> Source tab -> Add Folder - select a virtual folder =>
virtual folder becomes a source folder : *not* good
A virtual folder should not be converted to a source folder.
