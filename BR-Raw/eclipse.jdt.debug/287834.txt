Bug 287834 – JavaLineBreakpoint is not thread-safe and causes 100% CPU
Build ID: Eclipse 3.5
Steps To Reproduce:
I was in a normal debug session.
When I wanted to pause a thread, the request timed-out.
Afterward, the CPU went to 100%.
I needed to restart to fix it.
It looks like JavaLineBreakpoint can be accessed by multiple threads at the same time.
This may be unintentional.
The stacks I have show that there are two EventDispatcher threads active.
The comments for that class say that there should only be 1 active at a time.
If for some reason more than one is active, they can be simultaneously accessing the JavaLineBreakpoint.
Accessing a hashmap from more than one thread can corrupt its internal structure and it can go into an infinite loop.

Attaching several stacks I took while the CPU was at 100%.
