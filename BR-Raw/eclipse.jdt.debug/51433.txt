Bug 51433 – JavaDebugImages has a ton of constants
JavaDebugImages contains a bunch of constants for image keys *and* a bunch of constants for
image descriptors.
A quick check shows that these keys aren't all used.
Instead of creating all
images in constant declarations, we should add a declareImages() method like the other images
classes have.
