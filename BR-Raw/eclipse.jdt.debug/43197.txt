Bug 43197 – Race condition between console line tracker and debug terminate event
I have both a console line tracker and a debug event listener registered for
the same process.
When the process terminates, I want to do different things
in the plugin based on the messages that were written out by the process.
However, sometimes I'm getting the process terminated event *before* the last
call to the line tracker is made.
It looks like the process termination event
is handled by a Job worker thread, while the console line comes in on the main
thread.
They appear to happen at about the same time so it's a race to see
which is actually called first.
I tried to use the IConsoleLineTracker.dispose() method to perform the action
but that is not called until the launch is removed.
There doesn't appear to be
a way for the console line tracker to know if it has the last line or not.
If the code that fires the termination event were changed to wait until the
last IConsoleLineTracker.lineAppended() method was called and returns first,
that would take care of it.
Another way would be to have a new method, say
IConsoleLineTracker.term(), to mirror the init() method.
It would be called
after the last lines had been appended and the process was terminated, and I
could put my what-to-do-after-termination logic there.
