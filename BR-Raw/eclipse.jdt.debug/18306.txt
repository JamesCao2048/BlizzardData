Bug 18306 – Use safe runnables for listeners and "untrusted" code
See Bug 18305.
An NPE in the runtime workbench launch configuration prevents
me from opening the launch configuration dialog.
Whereever possible, the platform launch config support should defend against
errors in the delegates.
An error in one delegate (in this case, PDE)
shouldn't cripple the platform.
