Bug 254677 – [patch] Add step filtering of bean-style getters and setters
Created attachment 117393 [details]
Patch for this feature
A colleague suggested that the debugger could filter out simple getters and setters when single stepping, and I couldn't resist the challenge.
So here is a feature:
- adds checkboxes for filter getters and filter setters to the step filtering preferences page
- when step filters are used, and the corresponding options are turned on, simple getters and setters are filtered out.
- the filter is based on recognition of the very simple byte code signatures of getters / setters.
Patch is against R3_4_1 (plugins org.eclipse.jdt.debug, org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui, and org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user)
I can update it to HEAD if you need.
Try it, it makes single stepping a lot easier!
