Bug 343039 – Turn on monitors by default
The JDT debugger has the ability to show monitors owned by a thread.
 this is turned off by default.
 Dunno how long this option has been here but many people (including me) never knew it was there and would have greatly benefitted from its use in time-consuming race and deadlock debugging sessions.
Please consider turning it on by default.
