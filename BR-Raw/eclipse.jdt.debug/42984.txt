Bug 42984 – No way to set working directory, VM args for Ant processes
When running an ant script in a different JRE, I cannot seem to select the
working directory for that JVMs process - the following script always prints out
the eclipse install directory.
 One would think that setting the "Base
Directory" field on the Main tab of Run ant dialog would set the working
directory as well as the ${basedir} variable - though I can't see a need for
overriding the basedir variable, ant ALWAYS defines ${basedir} as the directory
containing the script you are running.
<project default="all">
<target name="all">
<echo message="user.dir: ${user.dir}"/>
</target>
</project>
