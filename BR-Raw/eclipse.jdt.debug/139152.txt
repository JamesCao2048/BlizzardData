Bug 139152 – [preferences] Java->Debug preference page validates uninitialized fields
N20060428
1.
Open 'Window->Preferences'
2.
Go to 'Java->Debug' page
3.
An error is shown which disapears quickly
4.
Close the dialog
5.
Open 'Window->Preferences'
6.
The 'Java->Debug' page is shown and the error disapears again.
This only happens when you switch to this page for the first time after opening the dialog.
See attached screenshot.
Could also be a platform bug?
