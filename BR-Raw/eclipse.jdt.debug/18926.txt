Bug 18926 – unable to add JDK 1.1.8 to Installed JRE's in Preferences
In 20020528 on Windows 2000, I am unable to add Sun JDK 1.1.8 to the list of
Installed JRE's and then select it as the default JRE.
 Here are steps I take.
1.
 Go to Window/Preferences/Java/Installed JREs
2.
 Click Add...
3.
 Set JRE Name to "Sun 1.1.8", Set JRE home directory to "D:\java\jdk1.1.8"
4.
 Click OK
5.
 Click the checkbox to set it as default.
An error window pops up stating "Installed JRE location no longer exists.
 JRE
will be removed.
 Reason: JRE removed"
This is a pretty big problem in that I can't get any development done.
Here is the weird part, I have an old workspace where this was working, and I
can use that workspace with any of the current builds without experiencing this
problem.
 It has no problem using the JDK, it just can't add it on a clean
workspace.
