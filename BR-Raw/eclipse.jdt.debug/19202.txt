Bug 19202 – JavaLineBreakpoint holds JDIThread pointers
Repeatedly debugging a program to a breakpoint, then terminating and removing causes an
unbounded memory leak.
 Leak is traceable to JavaLineBreakpoint and the fSuspendEvents
HashMap.
 Entries are never removed from this map.
 This in turn pulls in a fair number of other
objects, such as RuntimeProcess, OutputStreamMonitor, etc.
