Bug 120135 – catch up with new type rename refactoring support
Type rename supports an optional "update similarly named variables and methods" option.
This can cause many member name changes.
The BreakpointRenameTypeParticipant needs to be updated to handle these changes.
For M4, we disable the breakpoint participant when the option is checked.
