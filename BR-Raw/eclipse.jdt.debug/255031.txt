Bug 255031 – Missing EEs prevent project to build
I20081111-0800
I have projects that specify CDC1.1/Foundation1.1 as EE.
When I load them in this week I build, the projects no longer compile despite having the project level warning set of ignore or warning.
This results my project in having "a build path error" and nothing gets compiled.
To reproduce, load the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.console and org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director from the /cvsroot/rt repo.
