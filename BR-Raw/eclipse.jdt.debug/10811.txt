Bug 10811 – Deregistered launches not removed by JavaHCRManager
The JavaHCRManager listens to launches being added/removed, but it does nothing
when a launch is removed.
In the case where a launch is deregistered without properly terminating in the
debug model (via TerminateAndRemove), this means that the HCRManager keeps
trying to send HCR notifications to the dead VM.
