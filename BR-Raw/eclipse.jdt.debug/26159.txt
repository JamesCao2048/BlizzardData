Bug 26159 – NPE evaluating snippet in anonymous inner class
build 20021113
I have some test code that contains an anonymous subclass.
 Whenever I try to
select code in the context of one of its methods and evaluate it using snippet
evaluation, it throws a NPE.
 The NPE happens while visiting a MethodInvocation
node in the AST.
 The visitor calls "methodBinding =
node.getName().resolveBinding()", and this returns null.
Then it calls
"containsAsLocalType(methodBinding), which tries to invoke a method on
methodBinding, but it is null, hence the NPE.
I have not been able to construct a simple test case.
 To reproduce my scenario:
Checkout the following from dev.eclipse.org:
org.apache.ant
org.apache.xerces
org.eclipse.ant.core
org.eclipse.core.boot
org.eclipse.core.resources
org.eclipse.core.resources.win32
org.eclipse.core.runtime
org.eclipse.core.tests.harness
org.eclipse.core.tests.resources
org.eclipse.platform
org.junit
Put a breakpoint in the method "wasSuccess" in the anony inner class inside
org.eclipse.core.tests.resources.LinkedResourceTest#testMoveFile.
Use PDE Junit to launch the test LinkedResourceTest.
When the breakpoint is hit, step a couple of times, and then try to evaluate the
expression "destination.exists()".
 It will then NPE.
