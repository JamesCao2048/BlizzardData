Bug 218086 – Filtering statics also filters constants
When working on bug 169359 and  bug 214744 we changed the way that the show constants and show statics actioned filtered the view.
 The logic used to filter the variables should work differently.
Right now, if the user wants to filter statics, all statics are removed including constants (static finals).
 While constants are technically statics, the actions are named Show Constants and Show Statics.
 Having Show Statics turned off should not filter constants.
