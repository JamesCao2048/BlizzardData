In daily use of the new feature, it indeed disturbs that the list of variables jumps up and down during stepping depending on the availability of a return value.
Therefore, I suggest to always show a node as a place holder, and if no return value is available signal this by changing the label to s.t.
like "no method return value".
The new icon from bug 499655 should be constantly shown, perhaps a disabled state would further improve UX.
