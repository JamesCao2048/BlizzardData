Bug 34190 – Evaluation: no stacktrace upon exception
I2003-03-06
In the past, whenever code that I executed in the evaluation view raised an exception, its stacktrace would have been displayed in the console.
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to get this information anymore.
Scenario: I use a framework that has some validation functionality that raises an exception including an error message that describes the problem.
In the past, when debugging I used to execute that validation code via the evaluation view and was able to detect the problem.
This is not possible anymore.
