Bug 204455 – ConnectionType not remembered in Remote Java Application Launch Config
M4 I20070921-0919
1.
 Create a Remote Java Application launch configuration
2.
 Change connection type to Standard (Socket Listen)
Notice that the Apply button is not enabled after the change.
Clicking Debug will still launch the "Attach" connection type.
The Connection Type still specifies "Attach" if the same launch configuration is opened again.
Updating the "Port" allows me to apply the changes and will launch properly.
