Bug 38371 – Changes for JDT Core fix: JavaCore.newLibraryEntry(...)
IMPORTANT: JavaCore.newLibraryEntry(...) incorrectly tolerates relative source
attachment path which is against the spec.
This new patch will log an entry
inside the .log when this is detected, and silently convert the path internally
into an absolute one.
By our spec, client code should be fixed.
It seems that the JREContainerInitializer should be corrected (when opening
InstalledJRE page, it will use empty relative source attachments "", instead
of "/").
