Bug 73624 – Don't prompt for main class when main class is selected
eclipse 3.1 build 200409070800
Select a java compilation unit in the Package Explorer.
Make sure it is one
that contains a class with a main method (so we'll call it a "main class"),
and that there are other main classes in the same package.
Right-click to get
a menu, and select Run -> Java Application.
I do not expect to get a dialog at this time that asks me which class I would
like to run, because I have already said which class I would like to run.
Please look to see if the user has a main class or CU selected (or a method in
a main class) and use this information to avoid bringing up the redundant
dialog.
