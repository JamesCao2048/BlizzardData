Bug 53115 – Contribute remote Ant support as an extraClasspathEntry
Currently, the support jar required to run Ant in a seperate VM (that handles
build logging), is known to the AntCorePrefs as #getRemoteAntURL().
Instead,
Ant UI should contribute the entry as an "extraClasspathEntry" (and we should
remove the associated method from Ant core).
