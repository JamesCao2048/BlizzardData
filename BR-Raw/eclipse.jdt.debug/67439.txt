Bug 67439 – Support for hidden launches so they don't show in launch view.
We have a daemon that listens for new connections.
 When it gets a new
connection it creates a special launch configuration and launches it.
 The
launch delegate for this configuration creates the correct debug target and then
adds it to our wrapper debug target which is already running.
 This allows us to
add new sub debug targets to our wrapper debug target dynamically.
 However the
launch for the sub debug target shows up in the launch view whereas we would
like it to be hidden - the user should only see the launch for the wrapper debug
adapter.
