Bug 178641 – [performance] conditional breakpoint performance test failure
The performance test for conditional breakpoints is much worse on windows in 3.3 than 3.2x.
It appears the amount of "side effect" work overlapping with the test is different in 3.3.
For example, when running the test on 3.3, the source editor tends to open, where it does not open in 3.2.
As well, the 3.3 test suite has additional views that get activated when a target suspends ("view management" tests).
The test is only intended to measure the time for a conditional breakpoint to be evaluated in a tight loop.
