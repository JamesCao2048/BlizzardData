Bug 181204 – [launching] context launching of non-resource based objects
The context launching enhancement provided through bug 74480 only applies to resource based objects.
I like the enhanced behavior.
However, my product uses non resource objects to launch remote programs so I request the context launching to be further enhanced to handle this scenario.
As the background information, the following comments are extracted from bug 74480:
>>   My run/debug launch configuration applies to remote executable object or
>> process.
For example, run/debug program on remote host or debug process on
>> remote host.
Remote object is NOT an IResource.
>>   Does this mean I can not take advantage of the proposed context launching ?
>> Is there other way to determine the context mapping except using IResource ? 
>Currently, conetxt launching is resource based.
For 3.3, this is all we have
>planned.
We may one to look at further enhancements to this in a future release
>to allow for context launching of non-resource based objects.
>Marking fixed & verified.
New bugs should be opened for issues pertaining to
>context launching.
