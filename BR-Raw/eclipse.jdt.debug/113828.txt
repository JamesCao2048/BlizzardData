Bug 113828 – Make Java BP properties dialog publicly accessible
For SQLJ we use JDT Java breakpoints.
 From the editor veritical rule we want to
have the popup menu action to show the breakpoint properties dialog.
The existing JavaEditor action
(org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.actions.JavaBreakpointPropertiesRulerActionDelegate)
is internal, but if it was an external API then we could use it for our editor
too.
Other editors that use JavaStratumLineBreakpoints could also benefit from having
this public API.
