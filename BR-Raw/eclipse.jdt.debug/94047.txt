Bug 94047 – [ActionSets] [classpath] Toolbar shudders when opening the Classpath Variables preference page
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050506-1600
When you open the Classpath Variables preference page from an empty workspace
(only minimal plugins activated) the toolbar shudders as if components are
quickly being added and removed.
 The preference page is causing the activation
of quite a few plugins (Ant UI, JDT JUnit, JDT Launching, PDE and PDE core).
 I
don't think any of these plugins contribute actions to the toolbar of my current
perspective (could be wrong though).
