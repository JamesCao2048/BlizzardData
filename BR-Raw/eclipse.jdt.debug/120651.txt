Bug 120651 – Display and Content Assist do not work consistently in Variables View
1.
 From the Variables View, select "list"
2.
 From the details pane, type "this." and CTRL+Space to bring up content assist.
 Content assist does not work in this case.
3.
 Change to "list." and CTRL+Space to bring up content assist.
 Content assist works this time.
4.
 Select ".size" from content assist.
5.
 Select the resulting string and type "CTRL+Shift+D" to display the string.
6.
 Resulted in the error that "list" cannot be resolved.
I have to change the text back to "this.size" to display the value.
 It seems that content assist and display is not getting context for evaluation consistently.
Testcase:
ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
list.add("one");
list.add("one");
list.add("two");
list.add("three");
System.out.println(list);
