Bug 21400 – Loss of member details in text of Breakpoints
Since we fixed bug 17868, we have lost the fine grain detail of which member in
a type that a breakpoint is located.
We could add attributes to a Java line breakpoint for memberStart and memberEnd
so that we could render the name of the method that a breakpoint is located
within.
