Bug 24579 – Deadlock on first checkout of java project
Build 20021008
Exact steps followed:
1) Open new workspace
2) Go to Preferences-> Plugin Development -> Java Build Path Control
3) Uncheck all check boxes
4) Open new CVS perspective
5) Create anonymous connect to eclipse.org
6) Checkout org.eclipse.core.resources
Deadlock.
Note: this is not a core bug, I'm just logging it here until I can investigate
further.
 The problem is that someone is launching a ModalContext thread from
the UI, and not blocking until it finishes.
 Then another ModalContext is
forked, so we have:
ModalContext1: holding Workspace lock, attempts syncExec
ModalContext2: waiting on workspace lock
UI thread: blocked on ModalContext 2
