Bug 383625 – JDT version of com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet doesn't extend java.util.set
Build Identifier: Version: 3.7.2 Build id: M20120208-0800
In jdi.jar from org.eclipse.jdt.debug, com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet is defined as such:
public interface EventSet extends Mirror , Collection {
...
In all versions of the JDI javadoc since 1.4.2, it is defined as:
public interface EventSet
extends Mirror, Set
Code that compiles against the Sun/Oracle version of JDI, and rely on the fact that it is a Set, doesn't run inside Eclipse.
Reproducible: Always
