Bug 167426 – InstructionPointerContext keeps reference to closed editor
I20061129-1340
Found while looking at bug 166761: take the example from that bug but don't step into selection.
Instead simply close the editor.
==> InstructionPointerContext references the closed editor and hence an instance stays around until the debugger is terminated.
