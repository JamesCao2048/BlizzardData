Bug 34052 – CTRL-Z Not Recognized as EOF
Hello,
A Java program that reads console input (i.e., System.in) does not seem to
recognize CTRL-Z as the end of file character when the program is run from
within Eclipse.
If such a program is run from outside Eclipse (i.e., from a command shell) the
CTRL-Z *is* properly recognized as EOF.
My comment applies only to CTRL-Z on Windows.
I'm not sure what happens with
the Unix equaivelent, CTRL-D.
As an aside, I came across this probelm when running a program generated by
JavaCC.
If you have any questions or need further information please feel free to
contact me.
