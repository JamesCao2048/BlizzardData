Bug 181220 – Variable text font does not update correctly when columns turned on/off
I20070403-1110
When the variable text font setting was added (bug 176478), an unusual problem occurs.
 So far the only time the behaviour occurs is when debugging with a java.util.Random instance being displayed in the variables view.
 There is a screenshot and example code on bug 176478.
With the Random instance expanded, change the variable text font setting (Preferences > Appearance > Colors and Fonts > Debug folder > Variable text font).
 Then toggle the view columns setting in the variables view.
 You may have to change the font and toggle the setting several times in different combinations.
 You may also have to have one of the fields of the Random expanded.
When the problem occurs, the three private fields of the Random instance will stop updating, changes to the text or font of those entries will no longer change.
 There is no call being made to VariableLabelProvider for those entries.
This bug is marked as a platform bug since it is likely to be a problem with the viewer, however the only test case discovered so far is using java.util.Random.
 The bug is marked as trivial as the case is unlikely to be reproduced by a user.
Bug 176478 contains some test code and a screenshot of the behaviour.
