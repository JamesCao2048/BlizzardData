Bug 21823 – use java debug model adapters
It has been noted that it could be "easier" to write a debug model that proxy's
the Java debug model, if the Java debug model were to use adapters extensively.
That is, the java debug model should retrieve adapters before performing casts
on its model objects.
This requires deeper investigation.
