Bug 40707 – Breakpoint remains enabled after disabling & setting hit count
* Open the (new) properties dialog on a watchpoint
* Enable the hit count, and set to "3"
* Disable the breakpoint
* Press OK
Note: the breakpoint is still enabled.
Re-opening the properties dialog shows
the breakpoint as still enabled.
