Bug 350918 – [java launching] Applet parameters containing unusual characters confuse eclipse
Build Identifier:  20100917-0705
Try passing an 8 character applet parameter like 'foo'"Bar"
to an applet using the eclipse debuging environment.
  Or if you
are more adventurous, try some chinese text, such as æ‚¨å¥½.
You won't get anything reasonable as the parameter value when you call
getParam
It may be the case that this is an ill-defined area in general, but
even so, if unexpected or unpredictable results are "expected" it would
be better not to allow GIGO
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
experiment with unusual applet parameters.
