Bug 237709 – [preferences] Installed JRE tab does not pick up new JRE created in other Preference Pages
Build ID: M20080221-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
In WebLogic Server Tools plugin, we
create a new JRE when user creates a new WLS Server Runtime
in the WTP "Server" Preference Page.
The code to create JRE looks like:
final VMStandin vmWorkingCopy = new VMStandin( type, vmId );
vmWorkingCopy.setName( vmId );
vmWorkingCopy.setInstallLocation( vmLocation );
vm = vmWorkingCopy.convertToRealVM();
JavaRuntime.saveVMConfiguration();
The last call persists the change to Preference store.
If user immediately switch to Installed JRE page,
the new JRE does not show up.
Even worse is that
if user closes the Preference now, the change is overridden.
More information:
If user creates the WebLogic server runtime outside of the Preference,
the JRE is picked up next time user
