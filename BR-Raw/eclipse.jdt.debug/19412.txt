Bug 19412 – more than one JRE on classpath
If a project has required projects that use a different build time JRE, all the
JREs show up on the bootpath and source lookup path in the launch config.
For example, create two projetcs, using container libraries, pointing to two
different JREs.
Create a main class in one of the projects (leaf project), and
create a launch config for the class.
Look on the bootpath and source lookup
tabs - both JREs appear.
Only the launch config's project's JRE should appear.
