Bug 8679 – Hit count ignored on breakpoints
20020123++
Suspend at a breakpoint.
 Remove breakpoint and set another one somewhere else
with a hit count.
 Resume.
 Notice that hit count breakpoint suspends every time, not just when hit
count is reached.
 Also found different situation when hit count was respected, but instead of
suspending when hit count was reached, debug session just seemed to freeze.
 This may have been a UI
update problem.
