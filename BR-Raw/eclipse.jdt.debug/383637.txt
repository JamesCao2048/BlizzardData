Bug 383637 – EventRequestManagerImpl#addRequestIDMapping and #removeRequestIDMapping does not handle VMDeathRequests
Build Identifier: Version: 3.7.2 Build id: M20120208-0800
VMDeathEvents returned by the EventQueue never carry the request which triggered them.
This is because EventRequestManagerImpl#addRequestIDMapping(..) doesn't handle VMDeathRequests.
The code is just missing.
So when trying to map the request id to the request using EventRequestManagerImpl#findRequest(..), the original request is nowhere to be found.
The same problem is visible in EventRequestManagerImpl#removeRequestIDMapping(..)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
create a VMDeathRequest
2.
enable it
3.
associate an IJDIEventListener to the request
4.
wait for a callback when the VM terminates
=> it never happens.
The VM terminates, the listener is not informed.
