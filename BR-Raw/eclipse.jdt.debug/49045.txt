Bug 49045 – Scrapbook launch config name is not user friendly
The names used for scrapbook launch configs are not user friendly, and not
meant for display in the current format.
Since LC names are now displayed in
the console title bar, we should change this.
For example "Console -
snip.jpage-Scrapbook-1071679716544".
