Bug 462932 – Gracefully handle partial absence of line information
Classes generated at run-time or processed by byte code manipulators may contain source line information for some but not all methods.
For this reason, ReferenceType.allLineLocations() should return all available line locations from all methods that do provide line locations, rather than throwing an AbsentInformationException for the first method without line locations.
The exception should only be thrown when no method of the given class provides any line locations.
This is the behaviour observed with the JDI implementation of the Oracle JDK.
