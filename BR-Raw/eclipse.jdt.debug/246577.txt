Bug 246577 – SupportsDisableGC is initiated as true for our J2ME vm which does not support GC
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
Hey,
I have a question about the
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.model.JDIDebugTarget#initializeState() method.
In this method, there is a piece of following code:
VirtualMachine vm = getVM();
if (vm != null) {
try {
String name = vm.name();
fSupportsDisableGC = !name.equals("Classic VM"); //$NON-NLS-1$
} catch (RuntimeException e) {
internalError(e);
}
I donÂ¡Â¯t understand why fSupportsDisableGC is set as true if the name of vm is not Â¡Â°Classic VMÂ¡Â±? We are developing
a plug-in which have another vm implemented in J2ME which does not support GC.
When doing debugging, our vm talks to eclipse vm through socket.
I found in this code, the SupportsDisableGC is set as true for our vm, and later on when eclipse debugger asks our vm to disable GC, our vm returns code 99 (not supported).
This caused some exception during debugging.
I can not provide any steps to reproduce this.
:-)
Thanks.
