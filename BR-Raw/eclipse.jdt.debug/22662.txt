Bug 22662 – IClasspathContainerPage needs more context [build path]
When adding a container to the buildpath of a project, it would be nice to have
more context in the page.
At least the classpath of the project that the
container will be added to.
This way one can handle inter container dependencies
(fe this library can be used in combination with this base library, etc)
