Bug 16930 – Eval: incompatible thread state
When I pause a thread (manually), and perform an evaluation, I get an
InvalidThreadStateException - which is expected.
We should provide a better
error message for the user, as the 'toString' area does - i.e.
must be
suspended after a step or breakpoint to perform an evaluation.
