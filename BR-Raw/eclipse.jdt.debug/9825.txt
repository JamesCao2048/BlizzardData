Bug 9825 – Action icon inconsistencies
20020212++
The debugger has several different approaches to what "icon" is shown depending
on the state of the action.
 We need to come up with one consistent plan that
matches what is proposed for the whole workbench.
For example, look at the remove all action icon in the launch view and
breakpoint view.
 In the launch view, the action has color if it is enabled.
In the breakpoints view it does not show color until one hovers over the
action.
I actually prefer showing the color when the action is active (makes it easy to
tell what action is active instead of having to hover).
