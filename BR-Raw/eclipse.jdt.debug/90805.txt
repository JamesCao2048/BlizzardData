Bug 90805 – Drop to frame failed during evaluation, with no message in error dialog, and evaluation flag not cleared
build I20050405
vm: pj9n142ifx-20041206
- set breakpoint in FiltersAction.run()
- clicked on the Filters button in target's Problems view
- breakpoint hit
- evaluated:
Display.getDefault().beep()
- set a breakpoint in the beep method
- evaluated the same expression again
- breakpoint hit
- tried evaluating the following, from within the beep method:
OS.MessageBeep (OS.MB_OK)
- it told me that it could not do nested evaluations; fair enough, it is
actually nested here+
- stepped over the MessageBeep call
- IP was at the end of the method (frame for beep() still showing)
- tried Drop to Frame
- got a blank error dialog, but the details pane had details: Unable to pop the
selected stack frame due to invalid frame id, and that the thread had been
resumed (not exact wording)
- the thread had not been resumed, and the selected frame was still showing in
the Debug view
- resumed
- it paused back at FiltersAction.run()
- resumed again
- pressed the Filters button again
- breakpoint in FiltersAction.run() hit
- tried evaluating:
Display.getDefault().beep()
- it told me that it could not do nested evaluations; this is wrong - I had
fully resumed and was not within another evaluation
