Bug 1569 – Would like to inspect from the context of an inspect result (1GDKNZ7)
After inspecting new Main(), I would like to send foo() to the result.
Currently this is not possible.

I believe this would require a new evaluation context - i.e.
we have a stack
frame context and a global context, but we would need a way to tell the compiler
about the inspected result, and how to resolve/refer to it.
Would also need a UI to allow the snippet to be associated with the
inspect item - i.e.
like a VAJ or Smalltalk inspector.
