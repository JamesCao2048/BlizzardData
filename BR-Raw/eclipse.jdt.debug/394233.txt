Bug 394233 – InvalidThreadAccess launching plugin test suite using standard VM on Mac
Version: 4.3.0
Build id: I20121106-0800
If you add a standard VM on the Mac and then try to use that to launch a plugin JUnit test - in my case I was trying to launch the Ant UI tests - you get an InvalidThreadAccess exception and the launch dies.
The reason is because the -XstartOnFirstThread VM arg is missing, and is *not* added by default for non-Mac VMs.
The even more confusing part is that the new option to add the VM arg is there and checked on the Arguments tab (added from bug 211625).
The logic in that fix must be updated to either not show the option for non-Mac VMs or I need to push the support up from the Mac-specific VM runners to the platform VM runners.
