Bug 37942 – Launch config dialog should have some way to determine the full location of JARs that are listed on the classpath
In the dialog for setting up Java application launch configurations, the
Classpath tab shows only the names of JARs that are included.
It is impossible,
AFAICT, to determine where those JARs are located.
The Project classpath tab has
this info nicely displayed next to the JAR name - the launch config dialog
should likewise display the full location of JARs, or have an option to show
details of an included JAR.
