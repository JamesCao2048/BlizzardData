Bug 17025 – Adding JREs
If you add a JRE off of the installed JRE pref page, the button is
labelled "Add..." and the dialog is titled "Add JRE"
Off of the Launch config dialog JRE tab, the button is labelled "New..." and
the dialog is titled "Edit JRE".
We should be consistent...I like "Add..." and  "Add JRE"
