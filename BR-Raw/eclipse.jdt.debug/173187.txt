Bug 173187 – Line Breakpoint changes unclear during refactoring
1.
 I have 3 line breakpoints from the same class.
2.
 I refactored by renaming the class.
3.
 I went through the wizard and eventually ended up at the page where Breakpint changes are shown.
If you expand the Breakpiont changes, you will see three identical entires showing "Line breakpoint type change".
 The user cannot tell the differences between the three changes.
Same problem with method breakpoints.
 If I have multiple method breakpoints from the same file, the dialog does not show information to help the user distinguish between the different breakpoints.
