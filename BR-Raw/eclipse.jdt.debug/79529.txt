Bug 79529 – [java debug] Step Into Outermost method invocation
During stepwise debugging, I often encounter code patterns like this:
void doStuff(IProgressMonitor pm) {
...
something= somethingElse;
doRealStuff(getName(), new SubProgressMonitor(pm, 1);
...
}
When I get to the call doRealStuff(..), I'm rarely interested in stepping into
getName() and new SubProgressMonitor(..).
Instead, the most common action is to
manually place the caret into the outermost method doRealStuff and invoke Run >
Step Into Selection.
What I request is a command 'Step Into Outermost' with which I can do 'step
into' without stepping into method invocations inside the outermost method
invocation.
This doesn't need to be a new command - it could also be combined with Step Into
Selection: When the caret is not at a place where you can step into, that action
could just step into the next method invocation to the right of the current
caret position.
I.e.
when the caret is at the beginnig of the line
doRealStuff(getName(), new SubProgressMonitor(pm, 1);
, I could:
a) Step Into: goes into getName()
b) Step Over: goes to next line
c) Step Into Selection / Step Into Outermost: goes into doRealStuff(..)
