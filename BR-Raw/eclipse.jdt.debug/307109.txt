Bug 307109 – All JREs are a perfect match for JavaSE-1.6 on OS X
Build Identifier: 3.6M6, I20100312-1448
The execution environment preference pane shows all JREs as perfect match for JavaSE-1.6.
Happens in 3.5.2 and 3.6M6 for me.
See attached screenshot.
Because of this it picks 1.4 when launching with EE JavaSE-1.6.
Reproducible: Always
