Bug 162902 – [jres] "cancel" button should probably be "stop" for JRE search
3.3
From the installed JREs page, when "Search..." is pressed and a location to search is chosen, the progress dialog shows a "Cancel" button.
This button should probably be labelled "Stop" as the results found until the button is pressed are retained on the preference page (where cancel can be pressed).
