Bug 15581 – Move source lookup resolution to AbstractJavaLaunchConfigurationDelegate
Both JavaRemoteApplicationLaunchConfigurationDelegate and
JavaLocalApplicationLaunchConfigurationDelegate have the same code to compute
the source lookup from a ILaunchConfiguration.
 A method could be created in
AbstractJavaLaunchConfiguration to share this behaviour.
