Bug 78449 – Closed project error message problems
For an Ant launch configuration from a closed project you initially get the
correct error message in the Ant launch configuration dialog.
But if you then go to the classpath tab, the error message is incorrectly
cleared (but the red X remains on the classpath tab).
