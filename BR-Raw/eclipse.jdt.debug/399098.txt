Bug 399098 – Allow supplying pre-built JDT indexes for a JRE
Created attachment 226109 [details]
possible patch
In bug 356620 support was added in JDT to allow Eclipse-based products to supply pre-built indexes for classpath entries.
 It is currently not possible to supply pre-built indexes for a JRE container and, in our Eclipse-based product, allowing this would help improve the performance by reducing the time it takes to index our JRE.
 We have other function that depends on the index being complete so if a user were to invoke our function early then they would have to wait for the indexing to complete.
Attached is a patch which provides the necessary update to allow us to supply pre-built indexes for our JRE.
There are some minor things like @since and bundle version values that may need to be done.
 I don't know the correct values you want for these fields.
This patch was created against the R3_8_mainteance branch as, I'm assuming, this is what feeds the 4.2 SR2 release and, ultimately, where I'm hoping this can be included (i.e.
in some 4.2.x release).
