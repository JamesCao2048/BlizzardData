Steps To Reproduce:
See attached screenshots.
I attempted to change the value of a String variable that was null.
I could use the Expressions text box, but not the literal text.
Image 1 shows my the dialog as-is.
OK button is gray.
Image 2 shows my attempt to put a value there.
OK button is still gray.
Image 3 shows my third attempt -- maybe quotes would do it! Nope, still gray.
