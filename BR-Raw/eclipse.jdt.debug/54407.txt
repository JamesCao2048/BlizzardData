Bug 54407 – Make a pass on all the properties files
I did a quick pass over all of the files today and cleaned most of these up.
The source lookup seemed to still be a work in progress so I did not touch
those.
Near the end of 3.0 we should do a pass on all of the message properties files
to remove unused strings and fix up missing keys.
