Bug 30344 – Insertion of 'scrapbook' error messages unhelpful
When an error occurs in the scrapbook (e.g.
a syntax error) or a result is
returned, the scrapbook inserts text in the scrapbook page (which is what VAJ
used to do).
This has always been remarkably unhelpful; if the developer does not delete the
message/result straight away then when selecting a block of text next time may
end up with the error message being interpreted, which gives a further error
message ad tedium.
It would be much better if a pop-up-dialog box was used to indicate of a
result/error that could be dismissed leaving the source code intact, or
alternatively displaying the result using another mechanism (pop-up text,
console for standard output/error etc.)
