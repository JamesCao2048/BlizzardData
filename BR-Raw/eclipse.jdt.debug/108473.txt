Bug 108473 – [Performance] The performance of eclipse severely degrades over time
Same as [Bug 67259] on an other platform.
We are having the same problem on Windows XP.
So it may not be OS dependent.
System: Windows XP
JDK: Sun 1.4.2_08 or 1.5.0_04
Eclipse: 3.1.0
We are running Tomcat from Eclipse using the Sysdeo launcher.
After running Tomcat several times, there is a huge slow down in Tomcat:
Almost all the CPU time (more than 80%) is allocated to a thread in Eclipse,
Tomcat itself is not consuming much CPU time (less than 1%) but is not
responding correctly at all.
Tomcat process is run in debug mode.
If we stop Tomcat and run it again without debug mode, then it runs fine.
To have the debug mode running correctly again, we have to restart Eclipse.
