Bug 13957 – LaunchingPlugin specification of resourceCopyExclusionFilter
Currently there are bugs in the code.
 The constant has changed and we should
check for null when getting the key (even though JavaCore initializes the value
to "").
More difficult:
The UI for manipulating the setting of this option in the JavaOptions does not
take into consideration anyone setting a filter via code
(JavaBuilderPreferencePage).
 Is this an intended limitation?
