Bug 112670 – Can't toggle selection of treeitem in variables view
CTRL+SPACE should toggle the selection of treeitems in the variables view.
Instead, it invokes content assist which blocks normal windows keystrokes in a
platform widget.
Commands in the details pane should only be active when it has
focus.
