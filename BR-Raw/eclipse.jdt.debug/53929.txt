Bug 53929 – Run/Classpath tree entries need to show FULL path.
Verion 3.0.m7.
The Run/Classpath tree entries need to show FULL path to a jar/resource, not
just the file name.
Otherwise, there is you cannot tell which version of a jar
you are using.
Worse, if you have multiple jars with the same name as it often
happens when using 3rd party libraries (resources.zip is a common one) you
cannot tell which one is which.
The project properties dialog does it right IMO by showing the full path to a
jar/resource.
Thanks you.
