Bug 265714 – conditional breakpoint at end of step
Currently, if a breakpoint coincides with the location of a step end, the Java debugger does not evaluate the condition (there is little point since the step end has already suspended execution).
Recently, we have added support for breakpoint listener extensions to be registered on specific breakpoints.
In this case, breakpoint listeners are notified of a breakpoint being hit, even though the condition may be false.
Listeners should only be notified when the condition is true.
The Java debugger could evaluate the condition in the case that breakpoint listeners are registered for the breakpoint, and call them only when the condition is true.
