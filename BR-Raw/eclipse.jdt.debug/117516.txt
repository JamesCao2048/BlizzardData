Bug 117516 – Make JDT .java agnostic
Creating a separate bug for jdt.debug out of bug 89977:
Remove ".java" dependencies in JDT/Debug
attachment 30385 [details]
I have completed my investigations of JDT/Debug.
The following list shows the
relevant places and indicates whether they are a) fixed by this patch, b) no
fix is necessary, or in one case, c) I'm not certain, so hopefully someone more
familiar with JDT/Debug can comment:
JDT/Debug UI
BreakpointRenameTypeParticipant
line 52, fixed in this patch by using same extension as original
BreakpointLocationVerifierJob
line 137, fixed in this patch by using JavaCore.isJavaLikeFileName
line 147: OK, as .java is only used in a name given to the parser
JavaStackTraceHyperlink
line 171, fixed in this patch by using JavaCore.removeJavaLikeExtension
OpenTypeAction, line 162
AppletLaunchConfiguarionUtils, line 92
OK, as javaProject.findElement(IPath) still finds compilation unit
JDT/Debug
EvaluationSourceGenerator, line 226
LocalEvaluationEngine, lines 1199, 1282
JavaHotCodeReplaceManager, line 1126
OK, as javaProject.findElement(IPath) still finds compilation unit
JavaDebugUtils
line 175 - this may be ok if the returned string is used with
findElement, as in the above places, but I couldn't be certain this would
always in the case - it wasn't clear to me exactly when this code was called.
If required, we'd need to iterate over the registered Java source extensions
until finding a name which maps to a resource which exists.
