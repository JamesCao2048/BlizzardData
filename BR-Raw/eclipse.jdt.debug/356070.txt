Bug 356070 – [patch] Step into selection does not work for generic types
Build Identifier: 20100917-0705
For generic types (e.g.
Foo<T>) the "step into selection" functionality of the Java debugger does not work.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Example code:
public class Foo<T> {
private void sayHello() {
System.out.println("Hello!");
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
new Foo<String>().sayHello();
}
}
2.
Place a breakpoint in the main method
3.
When the breakpoint hits, put the cursor on the call tio sayHello and choose step into selection from the context menu.
The bug is that this does *not* steps into the sayHello method.
Note that this functionality works fine for the non-generic case.
