Bug 426903 – [1.8] Cannot evaluate super call to default method
From bug 422029 comment #17:
"public interface A {
default int getOne() {
return 1;
}
}
public interface B {
default int getOne() {
return 2;
}
}
public class Impl implements A, B {
public int getOne() {
return B.super.getOne(); //bp here and inspect B.super.getOne()
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
Impl i = new Impl();
System.out.println(i.getOne());
}
}
Put a breakpoint where indicated and select + inspect "B.super.getOne()" - the resulting popup has the error about not being able to find the declaring type for the method."
As Jesper found this is currently not supported by the JDK: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8031195
Once JDWP has support for this it will be listed here (under the 'Enhancements ' section) http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/
