Bug 297840 – Strange Code in ExpressionInputDialog.dispose

Three things make ExpressionInputDialog.dispose not "standard":
1) it contains a misleading dispose method although it is not a SWT widget.
It seems that this kind of code is usually located in close();
2) dispose was called twice (bug #296552 - verified fixed)
3) it is not necessary to dispose widgets since they are automatically disposed when closing the dialog (from Window.close()).
For instance, almost no other dialog uses "getTextWidget().dispose()".
Cf.
discussion around bug #296494.
This seems to be a code smell and deserves a high degree of strangeness by our strange code detector.
Is it worth cleaning it?
