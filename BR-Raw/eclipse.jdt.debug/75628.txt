Bug 75628 – [performance test] filling context launch menu
20041005 smoke test
1.
Create a project with the JUnit sources and samples
2.
In the package explorer select SimpleTest or AllTests and open the context
menu - No 'Run as JUnit' available
It is possible to manually create a launch config, but then the test type name
has to be entered manually
Also note that opening the run menu seems to have become much slower
