Bug 15969 – Promote standard classpath/sourcepath providers to API
Both classes, StandardClasspathProvider and StandardSourcePathProvider,
provider generic and usefull implementations of resolveClasspath.
StandardClasspathProvider also provides the recoverRuntimePath method which is
going to be needed by anybody implementing the IRuntimeClasspathProvider
interface properly.
