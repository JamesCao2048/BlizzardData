Bug 13834 – Can't set breakpoints in external source
Build 20020321
There doesn't appear to be any way to set a breakpoint in source code which is
not managed by Eclipse.
I'm debugging code on a remote VM.
 The program includes some code which is
managed by my workspace, and some which is found in external JARs.
 When I
click on a stack frame for one of these unmanaged methods, I get a dialog
asking where to find the source.
 I point the dialog at the source, and an
editor on the appropriate .java file opens.
However, I can't set breakpoints in this file:
- there is no ruler displayed, so I can't double click o nthe ruler
- the context menu's Add->Breakpoint action is disabled
This is frustrating, as I'd like to set breakpoints in the code that I'm
examining!
