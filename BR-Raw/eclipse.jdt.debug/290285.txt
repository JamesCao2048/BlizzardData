Bug 290285 – API for custom JDWP commands and model state refresh
There is currently an internal API for sending custom JDWP commands via JDIDebugTarget#sendJDWPCommand(...).
This should become offical API and in addition, there should be an API to refresh the debug model state.
For example, a custom JDWP command/event could change the target's state, and the Java debug model state as presented in the UI is no longer up to date.
Clients need to be able to programmatically request a full model refresh when this occurs.
