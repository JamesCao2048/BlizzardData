Bug 20468 – Installed JRE: Source attachment set to non existing location
F3
When creating a new JRE on alocation that contains no source, the rt.jar's
source attachment path is set to a guess:
xxx/jre/src.jar, even there is no JAR like this.
This has as result that on the edit JRE page the image of rt.jar has a attached
source image.
To find out if the JAR really has a attachemnt set, you have to uncheck
the 'Use default' check, 'Source attach' on the JAR and browse file system.
The very first page of the JDT documentation ('Getting Started') is about
verifying the correct JRE installation.
As long as we will not have a src.zip
in our drop, it is important to let users do this source attachment check.
It would be very helpful if the visual indication is better.
We should not set a dummy path or let the label provider do an exists test.
