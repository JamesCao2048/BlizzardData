Bug 50909 – Make new bootpath options non-breaking
We added support for appending/prepending the default bootpath.
We can make
this a non-breaking change by placing the attribtues in the VM specific
attributes table.
Then the VMRunner can use the new options if supported
(rather than making the launch delegate responsible for setting up the proper
bootpath).
This avoids breaking existing launch delegates.
