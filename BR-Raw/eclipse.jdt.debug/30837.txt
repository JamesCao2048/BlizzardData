Bug 30837 – Loss of suspended at breakpoint information
Set an exception breakpoint for NPE.
Debug some code that will throw an NPE.
When suspended at the breakpoint, select an object variable in the variables
view.
The thread loses the information about being suspended at a breakpoint as a
result of the evalution.
