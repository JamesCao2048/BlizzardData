Bug 325777 – Eclipse JRE/JDK detection on Mac OS X should detect .jdk bundles
Build Identifier: I20100608-0911
Java for Mac OS X is transitioning to delivering the JDK as a bundle with the .jdk extension.
The bundles cause the Contents/Home directory to be opaque and inaccessible to standard file chooser dialogs.
A reasonable workaround (for Mac OS X VMs) would be to configure the dialog to select directories or .jdk "files", and tack on Contents/Home if it's a .jdk bundle.
Ideally, JVM detection can be done by simply running /usr/libexec/java_home -X, which reports all JVMs detected by the OS as an XML plist.
