Bug 40744 – Java Classpath tab is huge
Build: 3.0 M2
The classpath viewer should set a reasonable heightHint.
 Currently, if the
workspace contains many binary projects (and consequently many libraries),
when a new launch configuration containing a Classpath tab is created, the
dialog expands to an unreasonably large size taking up almost the whole screen
length.
