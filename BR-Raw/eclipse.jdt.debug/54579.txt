Bug 54579 – Progress indicator flashes for console output
build I20040310
- set a breakpoint in StatusLineManager.update
- make it a conditional breakpoint with condition:
System.out.println("update"); return false;
- launch target
- open text editor
- Ctrl+J, Esc, repeat
- the progress indicator in the host flashes for each line of text output
- it also appears very sluggish
