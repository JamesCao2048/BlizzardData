Bug 220654 – EEVMPage creates VM from EE file 3 times after selecting file
Put a breakpoint in JavaRuntime#createVMFromDefinitionFile().
Installed JRE Pref Page, click Add..., select Execution Environment Description, browse to an ee file.
Once an ee file has been selected, the breakpoint will be hit three times.
 Each time this breakpoint is hit, we are doing a decent amount of work, especially in the call to EEVMType.getLibaryLocations() because of I/O and regex calls.
The calls are always coming from the modify listener on the text box.
 However, the problem does not occur on the standard vm page.
