Bug 208744 – [breakpoints] Unable to set watchpoints on some field declarations
Build ID: I20070921-0919
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Copy the code below
2.
Reads the comments to know where to put watchpoints
3.
Watchpoints are not set, instead a breakpoint is set for
the next "valid" line (which is dumb i think)
public class Watchpoint {
double a, b; // unable to set a watchpoint on this line
double c, // unable to set a watchpoint on this line or the next one
d;
void foo() {
} // for somme unknow reason, this line gets "invalid" watchpoints as breakpoints
}
Workaround:
split the declaration, of 2 fields as 2 different line, and then add the watchpoints.
