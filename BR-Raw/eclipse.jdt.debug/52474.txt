Bug 52474 – UI Blocked when opening Java Perspective during CVS check out
build I20040218
- start eclipse with a new workspace
- switch to CVS Repository Exploring perspective
- check out a number of projects ( i checkout Platform UI module)
- now attempt to switch to the Java Perspective
NOTE that at this point the "UI is blocked" dialog is opened.
Probably due to the fact that starting the Java Perspective requires the
workbench lock?
The point here is that this will be a common pattern and it would be nice if
we could investigate makeing this scenario work more smoothly.
