Bug 180496 – Use the new ClasspathContainerInitializer API for the JRE
20070402
The following patch uses the new API in ClasspathContainerInitializer to signal the UI that access rules can not be modified, but source attachment, Javadoc and native lib can.
All other (user provided) attributes are not supported (and not shown in the UI.
I updated the UI to use the new APIs and removed the hard coded behavior for the JRE container.
Can you release for I20070205? Otherwise user will be able to modify the access rules again.
