Bug 113909 – Support for execution environments
It would be advantageous to be able to install a JRE (i.e.
have it listed in the
Installed JREs list and usable in the IDE) via an extension point.
 When
packaging tools and/or runtime environment, we would like to be able to install
the JRE that is associated with our runtime.
 Currently, in requires a good
amount of Java code to get the JRE installed programmatically.
 Having an
extension point that allows us to give the location of a JRE, the type of JRE
and a name for the JRE would be useful to many tooling and RCP developers.
 It
would also be advantageous to add a description for the JRE (to the UI as well).
Jeff and Wassim suggested that it would also be useful to point to the JRE
profile from the extension point.
 The PDE will be using the profile, so being
able to specify this with the JRE would be very useful.
