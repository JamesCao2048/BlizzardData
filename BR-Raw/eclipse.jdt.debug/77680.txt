Bug 77680 – HCR failed message for terminated VM
I20041102-2000
I finished debugging VectorTests, but left the termianted launch present in
the debug view.
Any time I modify a CU (refactor, change code), and save, I
get a dialog saying "Hot code replace failed", Reason: The target VM does not
support hot code replace.
The error dialog should not appear for terminated VMs.
