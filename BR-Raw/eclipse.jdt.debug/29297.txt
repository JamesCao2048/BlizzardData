Bug 29297 – Debug does not honor multiple output folders
When project has multiple output folders, debug does not find new version of
compiled class (Hot code replace).
It looks like debugger searches only default
output folder and not changed classe's own output folder.
Project properties -> Java build path -> Source -> Source folders on build
path -> Allow output folders per source folder
