Bug 245793 – You cannot use Eclipse Variables when editing JRE preferences.
Build ID: I20070621-1340
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Open preferences
2.
Navigate to JRE
3.
Edit the JRE preferences.
4.
Attempte to specify the following:
-Djava.library.path=${workspace_loc}\myPluginWhichContainsARequiredLibrary
More information:
the variable ${workspace_loc} is not resolved at run time.
I use this in my projects to specify the path to dll's that are required at runtime when running JUnit tests.
This just means that for each workspace i create for a branch, i have to respecify the new absolute path to the plugin.
This is a request for enhancement.
