Bug 11514 – Feature: support WAS 5.0 JSP debugging
Due to changes in WebSphere 5.0, pattern breakpoints are not sufficient to
support JSP debugging.
 In WAS 5, org.apache.jsp is used as the package for the
Java source generated from all JSPs.
 With the current pattern breakpoint
support, it is not possible to distinguish JSPs of the same name in different
folders.
The proposed solution is to place a static field in the generated Java source
whose value is the full path of the JSP source file.
 After a successful
pattern breakpoint match, the debugger will check this field if present.
