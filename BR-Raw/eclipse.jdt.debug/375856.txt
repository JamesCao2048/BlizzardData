Bug 375856 – Launching is failing due to missing optional project(s)
Build Identifier: I20120314-1800
In my workspace, I have two projects.
 Project 1 is linked to Project 2 in the .classpath file as a "src" entry that is optional.
 The jar that Project 1 creates is also added to the .classpath of Project 2 as a "lib" entry.
 When I try to run JUnit tests within Project 2, the launch fails with the message "Project 1 does not exist" in my Progress view.
This should not fail since Project 1 is optional and only linked for debugging purposes (source linkage).
 The classes from Project 1 are available thorough the jar that is present in Project 2.
 Launching Project 2 in the Servers view works fine, so I don't think it is all types of launching that are affected -- it may be isolated to JUnit.
.classpath snippet from Project 2:
[pre]
<classpathentry kind="src" path="/Project1" combineaccessrules="false">
<attributes>
<attribute name="optional" value="true" />
</attributes>
</classpathentry>
<classpathentry kind="lib" path="WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/Project1.jar" />
[/pre]
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Link projects as described in details
2.
Launch Junit tests in Main Project
3.
Check Progress view for "Subordinate Project does not exist"
