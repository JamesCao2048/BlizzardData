Bug 28177 – Stack frames not updating when watch expression present
If I create a watch expression before debugging a program, stack frames do not
update properly.
(1) Add "System.currentTimeMillis()" to the expression view
(2) Debug "VectorTests" to a breakpoint in "testCapacity()"
(3) Stack frames show up as "<unknown receiving type>..." etc.
