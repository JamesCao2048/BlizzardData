Bug 57258 – Option to show toString values in Variables View
It would really be nice if there were a "Show toString()" option in the drop-
down menu for the Variables View that would display toString() values next to
each item in the variable tree.
 This would prevent me from having to click on
every item to see its toString() value in the Details pane.
