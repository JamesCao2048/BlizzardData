Bug 10035 – The Launcher should support variables
My projects often contain data that is necessary to start the application.
I have for example ini files for configuring the Application.
When testing the application ( I also have a bunch of Junit tests), I therefore
need to set the workingdirectory to the projectdirectory.
Since different developers my have their projects on a different drive or
directory  the path for the projectdir is not always the same.
It would be much
simpler to just specify the projectdir using a variable (like it's done with
libraries).
It would be even better if a path relative to the projectdir could be
specified.
This is because we usally generate our jar files and ini-files to a
directory relative to the project dir.
You may also consider to make  the project path the default value
for the workingdir.
