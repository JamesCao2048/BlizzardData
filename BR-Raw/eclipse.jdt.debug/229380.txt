Bug 229380 – Up/Down buttons incorrectly enabled on classpath tab
1) Open a Java Launch Configuration
2) Go to the classpath tab
3) Ensure there is at least one bootstrap entry and one user entry
4) Select the bottom bootstrap entry, the DOWN button is enabled, but pressing it does nothing.
5) Select the top user entry, the UP button is enabled, but pressing it does nothing.
We should be able to update the button to reflect whether moving it is possible.
