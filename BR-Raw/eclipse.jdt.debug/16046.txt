Bug 16046 – Launch configuration dialog doesn't/can't cancel a launch
When the user presses the "cancel" button on the launch configuration
dialog while a launch is in progress, the launch is not cancelled.
Instead,
we wait for the launch to finish and then terminate the launch if the user
pressed cancel.
This behavior is wrong for a number of reasons.
1.
A cancel button should respond immediately.
"Cancel" is used to stop
long operations.
If it doesn't stop the operation immediately, it's not
doing its job.
2.
After we've forced the user to wait until the launch completes (#1), we
shouldn't terminate their launch.
They didn't want to wait for the launch
to finish.
If we made them sit and wait for the launch to finish, they
should at least get something in return for their time - their launch.
What we really want is the ability to interrupt a launch while it's in
progress.
Until we achieve this, the Cancel button should be disabled
during a launch to reflect the fact that we are unable to interrupt a
launch.
