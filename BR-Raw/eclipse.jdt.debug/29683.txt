Bug 29683 – Re-naming a VM causes prompt for JRE resolution
Use case:
* Have more than one JRE defined in a workspace
* Rename a JRE (i.e.
in the Edit VM dialog) that is on the build path of a
project as an explicit (non-default) container.
* Press OK (save preferences)
The user is prompted to choose a JRE with which to build the project (since the
classpath container on the project is now refering to a non-existant JRE).
We have the info to fix up the classpath, so we should do it for free.
