Bug 341232 – Eclipse is not able to set the simplest of conditional breakpoints and reports that the condition has compilation errors when it doesn't
Build Identifier: 20110218-0911
I have set a conditional breakpoint in one of my objects with the following condition:
this.hashCode() == 518877755
Whenever this method is called by the application Eclipse complains that:
Conditional breakpoint has compilation error(s).
Reason:
Evaluations must contain either an expression or a block of well-formed statements
Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Set a conditional breakpoint in an object's method.
2.
Run debugger and get that method to be executed.
3.
