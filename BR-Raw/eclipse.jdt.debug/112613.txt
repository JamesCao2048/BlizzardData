Bug 112613 – Debug's Breakpoint actions act on remote stuff
I2051012-1200
Some Breakpoint actions (e.g.
toggle watchpoint) work on remote files which are
open in the editor.
Those breakpoints appear in the Breakpoints view but are
basically useless and clicking on them in the Breakpoints view doesn't navigate
to the remote file.
The actions should not operate on such files, not write to the log but instead
show a dialog similar to what all other JDT UI actions do:
Title: Cannot Perform Operation
Message: "The resource is not on the build path of a Java project."
Please do not display the element or file name: we are currently investigating
to create a dummy working copy for remote files in order to provide a Java
Outline for it.
If you show the name in the dialog it would look ugly.
