Bug 145592 – Debugger gets confused with watchpoints on fields with the same name.
Consider the following code:
public class Test {
public static class InnerClass1 {
public int foo;
}
public static class InnerClass2 {
public int foo;
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
InnerClass1 ic1 = new InnerClass1();
InnerClass2 ic2 = new InnerClass2();
ic2.foo = 2;
}
}
Notice that I modify the field within InnerClass2, but do not touch the field within InnerClass1.
If I add a watchpoint on InnerClass1's field, the debugger will stop on the line "ic2.foo = 2;"
My guess is that the confusion comes from the fact that the two fields have the same name.
