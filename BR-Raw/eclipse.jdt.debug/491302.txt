Bug 491302 – Java/Debug/Logical Structure pref page has wrong colors
Non editable entries are white text on black background on Linux with Gtk default theme Adwaita (due to usage of COLOR_INFO_* constants, which are ment for popups) which is way too intrusive in the UI.
Additionally when using Eclipse dark theme having same colors makes it undistinguishable from the rest of the UI using dark pallette.
As the bug is really similar to bug 488825 I'm taking the same approach and will make the respective class not implement IColorProvider.
