Bug 27989 – Provide 'final verification' launch configuration API
I would like to propose the following suggestion for the launch configuration
API change:
Tab group owners should be notified whenever a 'Debug' or 'Run' button is
pressed.
This will give them a chance to perform final checks before continuing
with the launch.
Some checks that require long time to run are not practical to
perform when corresponding control or even entire tab is updated.
This
notification should be 'unique' in a sense that they should know that this
is 'a final' check before.
Usage Scenario:
For example, if one needs to verify a process ID to debug from a remote
machine.
This could be a very expensive operation.
It may not be practical to
perform the validity check every time user changes the value.
Farthermore, it
may not even be practical to make a validity check every time performApply() is
called.
This is a very good candidate for the 'final check' API.
