Bug 442645 – Missing Java project context in stratum breakpoints
Before the fix for Bug 368212 there was this fallback code in JavaLineBreakpoint#getJavaProject
if (sourceElement instanceof IJavaElement) {
return ((IJavaElement) sourceElement).getJavaProject();
} else if (sourceElement instanceof IResource) {
IJavaProject project = JavaCore.create(((IResource) sourceElement).getProject());
if (project.exists()) {
return project;
}
}
This fallback code was deleted, even though the bug only required deleting a block further up in that method.
This is critical because for stratum line breakpoints (e.g.
Xtend) the source will generally be some IFile and not an IJavaElement.
This blocks conditional breakpoints in Xtend in Eclipse 4.3+
