Bug 54417 – Applet parameter name and value need to be quoted
In my applet,I need some parameters.
so,i configured the "Run Parameters"
like this: selfModule="something,and another."
but when i use "getParameter("selfModule")",i get "something,and" only.
I mean it cann't read characters after a blank.
Is this a bug? or my fault somewhere?
