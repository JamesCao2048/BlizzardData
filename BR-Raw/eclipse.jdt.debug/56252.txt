Bug 56252 – [Generic Console] no support for enabled/disabled lifecycles
Currently there is no support in the console API for consoles that are enabled
and disabled by the user.
First, I'll explain why this is important for the
CVS console then explain which console APIs that get in the way of having
extended lifecycles.
Writting to a console is expensive and more so when there is a high volume of
output generated.
With the CVS console we prefer to have the console disabled
unless the user decides to see the output of a specific command.
Previously,
the lifecycle was embedded in the opening/closing of the CVS Console View.
This workflow has changed, and instead I've had to add a preference to the CVS
console page to enable/disable the console.
It seems un-intuitive that the
generic console isn't the place where I can enable/disable a console.
On a
side note, we also buffer output when the console is disabled so that when it
is enabled we have a small history to show the user.
This is useful for using
the console when an error occurs, looking at the output, then closing the view.
Specific problems with the current consoles API:
1.
Lifecycle in AbstractConsole is short lived.
A console is not meant to be
added to the console manager after it has been disposed.
2.
There is no UI support for enabled/disabled consoles.
