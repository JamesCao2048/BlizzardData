Bug 86863 – [API] Move "selected structure" API to Debug UI
From bug 82273 comment #23:
It feels like the methods set/getSelectedStructureType(..) are more to
do with presentation than the debug model.
Could we move the methods to
DebugUITools, and move the implementation to the DegbuUIPlugin class? The core
deals with providing logical structures, but managing which ones are displayed
is really a UI issue.
