Bug 161781 – Suspend status ignored on initial remote debug connection
I have a modified VM with a "waitForDebugger()" function that suspends the current thread.
 The idea is to leave it suspended until the debugger arrives, so the debugger can inspect the current state before continuing.
When Eclipse attaches (through a socket on port 8000), it queries with a JDWP ThreadReference.Status message.
 The VM sends back RUNNING/SUSPEND_STATUS_SUSPENDED for the main thread and WAIT/0 for the other (VM) threads.
 However, Eclipse shows all threads as "running".
If I ask Eclipse to suspend the thread, everything works as expected, but when I hit "resume" it won't actually resume because the "suspend count" is still nonzero.
 At no time does Eclipse issue a SuspendCount query.
I can modify the VM to "fake" the first suspend, which will leave the books in order, but it doesn't help with the initial condition -- you still have to suspend the thread (or VM) manually.
Eclipse should use the suspend status from the Status call to set its initial concept of thread state.
