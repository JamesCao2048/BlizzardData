Bug 145553 – [variables] Cannot modify String variable with empty string value with Change Value dialog
If you try to use the Change Value action on a String variable that currently has the value "" the OK button is never enabled so you cannot save a new value.
Here is a test case.
Stopping at the System.out below and trying to change the value of s shows the problem with the OK button.
public class Tester {
public static void main(String[] args) {
String s = "";
System.out.println("done, s = " + s);
}
}
