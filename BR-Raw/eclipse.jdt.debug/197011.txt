Bug 197011 – Add JRE fails to retain system library modifications.
When adding a new JRE to the IDE, modifications to the JRE system libraries section will be lost once the user click on the OK button.
Steps to reproduce:
(1) Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs
(2) Click on Add.
(3) Fill in the requested information (JRE type, name, directory, etc.).
(4) Modify the JRE system libraries section by, for example, adding an additional external JAR file.
(5) Click on OK.
(6) Select the new JRE and click on Edit.
Any external JARs added (or removed) via the Add JRE window will be lost.
The Edit JRE window works as expected.
