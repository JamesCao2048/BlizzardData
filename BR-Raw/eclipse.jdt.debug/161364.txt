Bug 161364 – Evaluating Code that contains Generics does not work while debugging
When using the Display or Inspect feature while debugging my code I'm getting an error "Evaluations must contain either an expression or a block of well-formed statements".
This is actually independent on the code but does occure if the instruction pointer is inside the code of a method with signature:
private <T extends WebInput> List<T> getInputs(Class<T> type).
Outside of such a method the evaluation works as expected.
