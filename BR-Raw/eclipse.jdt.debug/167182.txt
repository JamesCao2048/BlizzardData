Bug 167182 – JDIDebugTarget.handleDebugEvents not using getAdapter when identifying the event source
Inside JDIDebugTarget.handleDebugEvents(DebugEvent[]), when handling debug target creation event, the current code uses "event.getSource() == this" to ensure the event source is itself.
Issue arised when a third party debug target, who registered itself as a event filter, caught and refired the JDIDebugTarget create event using itself as the new event source.
This will result the EventDispatcher never being launched.
Suggesting to use getAdpater when checking for the identity of the event source:
Object source = event.getSource();
if (source instanceof IDebugTarget && ((IDebugTarget)source).getAdapter(IJavaDebugTarget.class) == this ...
