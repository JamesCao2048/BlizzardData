Bug 86887 – Conditions do not work for JSP breakpoints
If you set a JSP breakpoint with the condition "true == false", it is still hit.
The reason seems to be that in
JavaLineBreakpoint.handleConditionalBreakpointEvent(), the call to
getJavaProject returns null.
This seems to be the case because
JavaModelManager.create(IFile, IJavaProject) assumes that the File is a java
file, a class file or an archive file.
Since this is a JSP file that is passed
through, it returns null rather than the correct source element.
