Bug 346116 – Java files open when inspecting the code, instead of Class file
Created attachment 195885 [details]
testcase
I found a regression from 342 to 362, similar to what bug# 297039 describes.
I made sure that I have the changes for bug# 297039 in my environment when I use 362.
The scenario:
When I debug the code for my application I see that the java files is open instead of the class file and I can't inspect the content of the 'this' variable.
I get an error saying "Unable to evaluate the selected expression: ...."
The setup:
I have two projects, JavaPrj (a Java project) contains my code and it makes use of a class inside of jar.
The jar is located inside of SimplePrj\lib (a simple project).
The jar contains the source and the binary code.
JavaPrj makes a reference to the jar through the Java Build Path -> Libraries > Add Jars...
button
The Run: (using the attach testcase)
- Add a breakpoint to RunMe.java at the initUtil method.
- Debug the application
- When the Eclipse stops at the breakpoint step inside of u.putAttributes
- Once inside try to inspect 'this'
