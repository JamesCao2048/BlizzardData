Bug 369480 – Fixed bug 369480: launchingsupport.jar must be 1.1 compatible (was:1.4.2 JRE is not recognized in the latest M5 builds)
- Fresh workspace
- Add 1.4.2 IBM JRE to your workspace (I also have 1.5 and 1.6 JREs added to the workspace)
- Java > Installed JREs > Execution environments > J2SE 1.4
=> 1.4.2.
JRE is not shown as a compatible match
- Import projects which use 1.4 as an execution environment e.g.
o.e.pde.ui
=> The JRE container will show 1.6 JRE
This is a major bug as I cannot build against 1.4 JRE.
Note:
- Things work with 3.8 M4
- Things also work with new builds and older workspaces (Things are fine in my dev workspace).
The problem surfaces only in new workspaces.
