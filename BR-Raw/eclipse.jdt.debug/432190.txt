Bug 432190 – Update default Javadoc locations, 1.4 and 1.3 docs/api/... are gone
Javadoc for 1.3 and 1.4 has been archived at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/ and
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/api/
, and the individual html pages are no longer available.
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/enterprise/deploy/shared/ActionType.html is still available, but the link to http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html also results in a 404 or timeout.
