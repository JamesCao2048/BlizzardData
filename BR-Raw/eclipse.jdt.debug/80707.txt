Bug 80707 – Make breakpoint / run mode check debug model specific
LaunchConfiguration.launch() calls preLaunchCheck() before calling launch(..)
launch(..) calls AntLaunchDelegate.launch(..) which does preLaunchCheck(..) again.
-> Launch a build file that has break points in run mode and you will be asked twice if you want to use
debug mode instead.
Makes an annoying feature worse :-)
