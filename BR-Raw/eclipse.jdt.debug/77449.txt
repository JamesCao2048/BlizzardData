Bug 77449 – tell user when monitor info unavailable
We should inform the user when monitor information is not available for a
target, and they have selected to "Show Monitor Information".
Options:
* information dialog when they launch a target that does not support it
with "don't tell me again" check box
* information dialog when they select the option in the view drop-down menu
