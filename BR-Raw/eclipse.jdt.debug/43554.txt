Bug 43554 – Creating a breakpoint on method signature should use a method entry breakpoint
Build 3.0M3
When double-clicking in the left margin in front of a method signature, a
standard breakpoint is created on the first statement of the method body.
I would rather expect it to simply create a method entry breakpoint instead.
