Bug 71824 – Allow choice of stratum when stepping
The user should be able to change the default stratum being used, based on the
available strata of a reference type.
Setting the stratum being displayed
should set the default stratum for the target (not just the type).
The user
should also have the choice of reverting to "default" stratum per type.
This
could be shown as a cascade context menu in the debug view for
IJavaStackFrames.
The action should only appear if there is > 1 available
strata.
