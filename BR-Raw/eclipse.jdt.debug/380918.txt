Bug 380918 – Launching is failing due to missing optional project(s) - pt.2
Build Identifier: I20120518-2345
In my workspace, I have two projects.
 Project 1 is linked to Project 2 in the
.classpath file as a "src" entry that is optional.
 The jar that Project 1
creates is also added to the .classpath of Project 2 as a "lib" entry.
 Project 1 is closed when not being actively worked on.
 When I try to run JUnit tests within Project 2, the launch fails with the message "Project 1 does not exist" in my Progress view.
This should not fail since Project 1 is optional and only linked for debugging
purposes (source linkage).
 The classes from Project 1 are available thorough
the jar that is present in Project 2.
 Launching Project 2 in the Servers view
works fine, so I don't think it is all types of launching that are affected --
it may be isolated to JUnit.
(See attachment for the projects.)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Import projects from attached archive
2.
Close Project 1
3.
Launch Main as Java application or Tests as JUnit test suite
4.
Check Progress view for "Project 1 does not exist"
