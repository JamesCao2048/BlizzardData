Bug 74480 – [launching] Simplify the launch experience for less technical users of Eclipse
During usability studies on testing tools based on eclipse, it was found that
all users had problems running/launching.
 The Launch Config Dialog appears to
be particularly difficult to use for "Testers" who may not have much development
experience.
The complexity of the launch configuration dialog contributed to create a
frustrating experience for the user.
In the dialog there are several configurations displayed to the user, many of
them seemingly irrelevant to the user (e.g., only 2 configuration types were
relevant to the user, but there were many more to select from).
Users often did not know to create a new configuration.
 In addition, the
perspective options on the right of the dialog (when no configuration has been
created) also resulted in much confusion as users tried to change the default
perspective options.
 Some users initially found the configurations but then did
not remember how to reproduce the process.
While launch shortcuts help alleviate the problem, many users still end up in
the Launch Config dialog or need to modify launch properties.
 Users expected to
be able to simply select their test (i.e., resource to launch) and click on the
run button.
 The behavior of the run button was not clear to users; they did not
realize the run toolbar button runs the last test.
