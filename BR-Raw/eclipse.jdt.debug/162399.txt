Bug 162399 – Problem in the implementation of the support of JSR-045
Suppose we have the JSP file:
testSimpleTag.jsp:[<%@ page import="java.io.*" %> some string here]
The valid SMAP for this JSP is:
SMAP
JEE_jsp_testSimpleTag_24890350_1152694486531_1152694491765.java
JSP
*S JSP
*F
+ 0 testSimpleTag.jsp
testSimpleTag.jsp
*L
1:38,0
*E
We use page directive before the String in order to be able to put a breakpoint on this line, otherwise eclipse offers to add a bookmark.
The right behavior of the debugger should be when the jsp execution hits the breakpoint the IDE to stop on this line.
However this does not happen.
So the problem here is that although the SMAP is valid and a breakpoint is set on this single line of the JSP, when the JSP page is requested eclipse does not stop on this breakpoint.
