Bug 12695 – Need to get full set of breakpoints hit from thread.
When creating super adapters on top of the Java debug adapter we set hidden
temporary breakpoints in order to control the Java debug adapter.
 If the user
also sets a breakpoint at the same spot as one of our temporary breakpoints then
when we get a suspend event due to a breakpoint from the Java thread we need to
be able to ask the thread for the list of breakpoints that were hit.
 Currently
we can only get one breakpoint from the thread.
 If we only see our temporary
breakpoint which we might choose to ignore and don't see the user breakpoint
then we will run away.
