Bug 43927 – Content assist does not work in breakpoint properties
This is for build I200309250800.
Before this version content assist was possible in the condition.
Now it does
not work anymore.
If Content assist is auto-enabled, it will show up after the
dot but by pressing Ctrl-Space it does not work.
3.0 M3 (200308281813) was OK.
