Bug 72169 – provided debug context for non-UI thread
DebugUITools provides #getDebugContext(), which in 3.0 and earlier, only works
in the UI thread.
It is useful to have this work in non-UI threads as well, to
allow for background threads to access the debug context (for example debug
hover help).
Since we already have the SelectedResourceManager providing a similar service,
it can also track the current "debug context" (selection in the debug view),
for access from any thread.
