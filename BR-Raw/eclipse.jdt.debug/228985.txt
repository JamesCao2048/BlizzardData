Bug 228985 – JREsPreferencePage.java resizing problem
Build ID: Build id: I20080409-1425
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Start eclipse, at startup, a configuration application, in this case, programmatically (not via the UI - pref page) adds a JRE to the JREsPreferencePage with a very long location path â€“ e.g.
170 characters
2.Go to the Window -> Preferencesâ€¦ -> Java -> Installed JREs
4.The Page (UI) is stretched all the way to the right and the Location column of this pageâ€™s viewer(table) is also stretched (170 characters â€“ in this case) , causing the UI to be badly layout
5.If the JRE with the long location-path was added via the UI, the UI is not stretched, the location column is not stretched and the UI looks good.
More information:
Does the Location column should stretch to a default max value at all time so preventing the UI from doing this?
