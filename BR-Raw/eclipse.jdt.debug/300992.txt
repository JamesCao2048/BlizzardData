Bug 300992 – Line breakpoint properties dialog has problems when target class is not available
I20100127-0100
The 'Suspend Policy' option is missing in the line breakpoint properties dialog.
The option is available in the Breakpoints view details pane, but not in the dialog any more (it's there in latest 3.5.x build).
