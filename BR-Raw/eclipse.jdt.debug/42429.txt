Bug 42429 – escaping double quotes
3.0 M3
* note the following program as an example.
It writes program args to
System.out.
public class Args {
public static void main(String[] args) {
for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
String string = args[i];
System.out.println(string);
}
}
}
From the command line, the following program arguments results in passing a
quoted string to the program, with the given result (->)
\"test\" -> "test"
From Eclipse, it results in the following:
\"test\" -> test
To get the same result in Eclipse, one must use this argument:
"\"test\""
It seems like we should be able to make the same command lines work from
Eclipse as from the command line (or at least perform the correct translation,
so the user does not have to figure it out).
I think that the rule is "if there
are any escaped characters in an argument, you have to put the whole thing in
quotes."
