Bug 249593 – Cannot set default compiler level for product
Build ID: org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.4.1.v_877a_R34x.jar
Steps To Reproduce:
We have a product where we'd like the default compiler level set to 1.5 instead of 1.6 (which is the default).
 We added these lines to our product customization ini file:
org.eclipse.jdt.core/org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.codegen.targetPlatform=1.5
org.eclipse.jdt.core/org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.source=1.5
org.eclipse.jdt.core/org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.compliance=1.5
However if we launch our product on a new workspace, these values get overwritten and replaced with 1.6.
 The above is how we customize all kinds of preferences.
 These ones don't seem to be working for us though.
 Is there something we're doing wrong?
