Bug 12300 – Sharing launch config difficult because of VM_INSTALL_ID
Build: 20020321
When trying to execute a launch configuration that someone else in the team has
created, the Run/Debug button is grayed out for a reason that is hard to find: The VM_INSTALL_ID
does not match any locally installed JRE.
It is not trivial to figure out that the Environment -> JRE
tabs must be edited.
