Bug 49047 – scrapbook suspends on uncaught exceptions
I20031216
I think this is a regression..
the scrapbook did not used to suspend on
uncaught exceptions.
When I turn the pref to suspend off, things work as
expected (i.e.
a stack trace is written to the console).
I beleive we should
ignore the exception for scrapbook VMs.
Since we cannot show the source code
for the exception (if it's actually part of the code snippet), it is very
confusing to the user, since they get a "source not found" editor.
