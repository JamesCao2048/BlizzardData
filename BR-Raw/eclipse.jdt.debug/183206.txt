Bug 183206 – [refactoring] Mysterious refactoring failure caused other tests to fail
Build: N20070419-0010 had a refactoring failure that subsequently caused 25 other tests to fail.
Our refactoring tests should be more atomic to prevent cascading failures.
The reason for failure of the test canot be reproduced, but it would be good to look at the tests to ensure that something is not hagged up.
