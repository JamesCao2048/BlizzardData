Bug 151487 – Variable hover incorrect for members of the same type but different object
Variable hover displays the value of the this member when hovering over the same member in a different object of the same type.
 For example:
public class Foo
{
private int id;
public boolean equals(Object other)
{
Foo that = (Foo)other;
return this.id == that.id;
}
}
Setting a breakpoint at the return statement and hovering over the id in "that.id" displays the value of "this.id".
