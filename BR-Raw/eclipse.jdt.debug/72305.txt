Bug 72305 – JDIModelPresentation uses resource name with IJavaStratumLineBreakpoint
When working with the stratum breakpoint support, I've run into scenarios where
the configured source shown for a JSP doesn't map to a resource in the
workspace.
 We've managed to set a breakpoint by placing the marker on the
workspace root, but the displayed text in the Breakpoints view doesn't reflect
the source name and source path used when creating the breakpoint, just the name
of the resource that was used.
 Because we're using the workspace root, that
ends up being "".
 The breakpoint hits correctly and its properties dialog, when
opened from the Breakpoints view, shows the correct title for the source name,
but the text in the view itself is wrong.
 I'd like to see
JDIModelPresentation.getJavaStratumLineBreakpointText(IJavaStratumLineBreakpoint)
modified to show the source name just like the properties dialog.
