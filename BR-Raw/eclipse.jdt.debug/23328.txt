Bug 23328 – Resume fails on "suspend VM" breakpoint after stepping - VM BUG
Test Case:
* put a breakpoing in VectorTest#testCapacity, line 34
public void testCapacity() {
int size= fFull.size();
for (int i= 0; i < 100; i++)
>>>			fFull.addElement(new Integer(i));
assertTrue(fFull.size() == 100+size);
}
* set the breakpoint to suspend the VM
* debug the program
* when the breakpoint is hit, step over TWICE
* resume the VM
* only the main thread resumes
The problem does not seem to occurr if I step over only ONCE.
Perhaps it has
something to do with hitting the breakpoint a second time (while stepping?)
