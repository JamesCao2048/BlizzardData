Bug 266651 – [jre] "JRE System Library" default not used properly after Java update (also with symbolic links)
Build ID: M20080911-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Updated Sun Java 1.6.0-u7 to 1.6.0-u11 via SuSE's updater.
2.
/usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0.u11-sun/bin/java , similar for /usr/lib/jvm/* (SuSE automatically updated where the system Java points to)
2.
Restarted computer and Eclipse
3.
Opened same workspace again
4.
Projects failed (see Actual result below)
5.
Package Explorer | myproject | context menu | Properties | Java Build Path | Libraries shows "JRE System Library [java-1.6.0.u11-sun-1.6.0.u11]", which is correct: the new and existing Java.
6.
I looked everywhere I could find, in Project settings and Window | Preferences, I couldn't see any u7 referenced.
Actual result:
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
Project 'myproject' is missing required library: '/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0.u7-sun-1.6.0.u7/jre/lib/resources.jar'	myproject		Build path	Build Path Problem
Expected result:
Uses new Java version.
Workaround:
In Package Explorer | myproject | context menu | Properties | Java Build Path | Libraries , double-click on "JRE System Library [java-1.6.0.u11-sun-1.6.0.u11]".
A dialog comes up, saying "(*) Workspace default JRE (java-1.6.0.u11-sun-1.6.0.u11)".
Instead, check "( ) Alternate JRE [java-1.6.0.u11-sun-1.6.0.u11]" and click "Finish" button.
The Error goes away.
Go in the same dialog again and check "Workspace default JRE" again.
The error goes not come back, although it's now the same setting as it was when the error appeared.
This confirms that it's an Eclipse bug.
