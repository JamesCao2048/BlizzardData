Bug 401358 – Name selection for Mac VM installs needs improvement

Screen shot
When you search for a JDK/JRE on Mac, we use information from the plist file to compute a name.
This works fine most of the time, but if you happen to have more than one of the same version of VM installed they are added with the same name.
To make matters a bit worse, if you edit one of the JREs the wizard starts out with an error complaining that the name is already in use.
The attached screen shot shows the duplicated names for the Java 7 JREs
