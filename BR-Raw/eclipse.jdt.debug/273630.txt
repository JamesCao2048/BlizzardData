Bug 273630 – Errors in breakpoint conditions not handled properly if breakpoint listener votes to resume
Testcase:
for (int i=; i<10; i++)
{
System.out.println("hello");  // BREAKPOINT HERE
}
1.
 Set a breakpoint in the loop
2.
 Add a condition that has error on the breakpoint
3.
 Have a breakpoint listener that votes to resume.
When the breakpoint is hit, we will receive an error dialog indicating that there is an error in the condition.
 However, since the breakpoint listener votes to resume, the program execution continues.
 As a result, when the same breakpoint is hit again, we receive another error dialog.
 It's very difficult to correct the error on the condition with so many dialogs popping up.
Expected behavior:
* Program execution is suspended even though the breakpoint listener votes to resume
* The user should only receive one error dialog.
