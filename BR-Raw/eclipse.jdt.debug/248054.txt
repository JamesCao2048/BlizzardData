Bug 248054 – Can't set breakpoint annotation as Highlighted
Build ID: I20080918-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
In Annotations, set Breakpoints to Show in Text as Highlighted, and pick a nice color.
Observe that breakpoints are not hilighted in the editor.
This isn't just the latest version, it's always been true.
More information:
This is the second biggest annoyance in Eclipse (after not being able to set syntax hilighting background colors).
The annotation icon for breakpoint is often overwritten by others (e.g.
warnings, tasks) so it'd be nice to see at a glance where the breakpoints were (a la Turbo C circa 1990...)
