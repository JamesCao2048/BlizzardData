Bug 170502 – [source lookup] [launching] string variables added to the bootpath via the launch dialog do not stay there
In the launch dialog if you go to the classpath tab (of a java app type) and add a string variable to the bootpath entries it will not stay there.
To reproduce:
1.
open launch dialog and go to the classpath tab.
2.
add a string variable to the boothpath entries
3.
hit apply and close the dialog
4.
reopen and go back to the classpath tab the new entry is now moved under the user entries
