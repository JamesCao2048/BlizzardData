Bug 30650 – Conditional breakpoint compilation problem dialog usability
Build: I20030129
If you have a compilation problem in a breakpoint condition, a dialog pops up at
runtime to correct the error.
 This dialog has the following problems:
- the text entry field does not scroll if the condition doesn't fit in the
allotted space.
- default focus should be given to the text entry field, rather than the ok button
- (minor nit) it looks weird to have this entry field center justified.
Usually these fields are left justified in the dialog.
