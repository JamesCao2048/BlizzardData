Bug 34297 – allow a launch configuration classpath to be "default plus"
I often want to launch a program using its default classpath plus one or two
additional jars or directories.
 The first time this is easy - just turn on
the "use default classpath" checkbox, then turn it off and add the additional
entries.
But after that, if the default classpath for the project changes, the
launch config's classpath is now wrong.
I must either manually edit the launch
config's cp, or I must turn on the "use default" checkbox and re-add the
additional directories again.
If I have several of these configs, this can be
quite time-consuming.
So, this is a request to add a feature whereby I can
say "use the default classpath plus these extra entries".
