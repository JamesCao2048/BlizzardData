Bug 13909 – Inconsistent margins on preference pages
Build: 20020411
The margins of preference pages are currently not consistent between pages.
To
ensure consistency, subclasses of PreferencePage are required to set margins of
layouts in composites returned by the method createContents(Composite) to 0
pixels (see the Javadoc for PreferencePage.createContents(Composite) in build
20020416 or later builds).
See the preference pages under "Workbench" for examples of properly-margined
pages.
Page contents should align with the left and right edges of the page
title area.
Please ensure that the property pages belonging to your team are consistent
with these guidelines.
In particular, LaunchConfigurationTypePropertyPage,
LauncherPropertyPage, and DebugActionGroupsPreferencePage may need to be
modified.
