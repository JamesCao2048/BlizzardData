Bug 31907 – Java Variable Settings needs another row
There are four boolean combinations; there should be four rows.
static final
static          1      0
final           0      1
static final    1      1
none            0      0
Currently, the table is interpreted as the "or" of the row values, but it
could be interpreted as above with equal clarity and greater expressive
power.
It is worth going to the extra trouble because very few people want
to see constants in the debugger, but many people want to see non-final
statics and non-static finals.
