Bug 47281 – Don't log VMDisconnectedException
After running the debug tests, we noticed VMDisconnectedExceptions being logged
from JDIThread#getName().
If the VM disconnects, we should just return
"disconnected" as the name and not log the exception.
Logging the VMDisconnected
in this case doesn't help anyone.
