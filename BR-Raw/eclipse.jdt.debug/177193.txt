Bug 177193 – Setting range of values in array objects in one request
Build ID: M20060921-0945
Steps To Reproduce:
Our code uses certain classes to streamline JDWP message transfer because those currently supported are way too slow.
Our code takes an array of bytes in the debugger and places them in an array in the JVM.
The first implementation of our code used IJavaDebugTarget.newValue() for each byte and then IJavaArray.setValue() to place the byte into an array.
This scheme causes JDWP messages for each byte and is very slow, about 1-2 kilobytes per second.
Our new implementation uses the following internal classes to create one message on the debugger side and send all the bytes in one JDWP message:
ArrayReferenceImpl
JDIMessages
JdwpCommandPacket
JdwpReplyPacket
JdwpID
We achieved acceptable performance in the past by limiting message size but new markets demand larger messages and force us to use these classes.
Please make them API or create a fast API for sending large JDWP messages.
Please note we are limited as to the version of Eclipse we use and consider making these changes in version 3.2.1.
