While fixing bug 285854, I also found two bad usages of URL#equals(Object) in JDT/Debug.
That method resolves the host of the URLs via DNS lookups, which is most of the time not what you want.
A scenario that e.g.
fails is when you edit a JRE definition and then replace the host part of the default Javadoc path
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/
with
http://72.5.124.55/javase/6/docs/api/ .
When you then click "Restore Default", the UI is not updated, but the preference is.
