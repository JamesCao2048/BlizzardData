Bug 260402 – Conflits during JRE's import are not solved correctly.
Project org.eclipse.jdt.launching, no idea which component:
Reproduction steps:
1.
Add a couple of JREs in the preferences (having 3 is ok).
2.
Export 'Installed JRE' preferences
3.
Rename all JREs (add f.e.
_2)
4.
Export 'Installed JRE's.
5.
Delete all JREs except default one.
6.
Import both files.
7.
Repeat steps 5-6 if necessary.
It usually works after second time.
Result:
not all JRE's are displayed (typically one is missing).
You will see something like
default
java_1
java_1_2
java_2
instead of
default
java_1
java_1_2
java_2
java_2_2.
Cause:
JREPreferenceModifyListener, lines 85-89
long unique = System.currentTimeMillis();
IVMInstallType vmType = vm.getVMInstallType();
while (vmType.findVMInstall(String.valueOf(unique)) != null) {
unique++;
}
vm = new VMStandin(vm, String.valueOf(unique));
This code replaces the conflicting id with the new one generated on the system time basis.
The problem is that the while loop is never entered, because vmType is aware only about already existing ids, not about newly created ones.
So if the second conflict is met and system time does not changes, the duplicated id is added.
Therefore we see missing vms.
