Bug 68233 – Null Pointer in JavaBreakpoint
I was using RC3 and doing hyades development, hyades wasn't installed in my
plugins but the hyades projects were open in my workspace.
 The workspace I was
using was originally produced by the M9 build if that's any help.
 The null
pointer occured during one of a long series of debugging sessions I had been
running, the backtrace was
$ java.lang.NullPointerException

at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)
after the backtrace I cannot be sure but the debugging session seemed to stall,
the runtime-workbench continued to refresh but actions would no longer have any
effect.
 I tried terminating the runtime-workbench and debugging again a number
of times but again the application would go unresponsive in certain areas, it
occurs to me that the unresponsive areas may of been in the same spots as some
disabled Breakpoints but I can't confirm that either way the exact spot the
program grew unresponsive varied, the state of the debugging window didn't
reflect having hit any kind of breakpoint.
 I shut down the program after noting
the Null Pointer did show up once more later on (important to note that I
debugged many times before and after with out the null pointer).
 The problem
appears to have desisted when I restarted eclipse.
I'm sorry I can't give steps to reproduce but felt I might as well give what I
have, I'll continue to play around with it and update this report if I find any
more info.
