Bug 5653 – DCR: Debugger should catch uncaught exception by default
From an Eclipse Corner post:
<post>
One of the things I always do when I am
debugging in Eclipse (I did this in VAME as well) is go to the Debugger's
"Breakpoints" view, click on the view's "Add Java Exception Breakpoint"
button, type "Throwable" in the text field, and make sure only "Uncaught" is
checked.
Then click OK.
What this does is tell the Debugger to catch any uncaught Throwables for me.
I find this *much* handier than ending up with a stack trace in the Console.
If an unexpected exception happens, I am still in the Debugger, and I can
select frames in the stack trace and go right to the current line in the
frame...
I can also still see the values of variables, because my VM has not
halted yet.
I never delete this breakpoint.
Every time I run a Java program under the
Debugger the "Uncaught Throwable" breakpoint is always there in the
background...
protecting me from myself <grin>.

The response to this post was as follows:
"That sounds like a great technique; thanks!
(Why isn't that the default behavior? :-) "
Please consider making this the default behavior.
