Bug 92838 – [api] add missing @since 3.1 tags on API added in 3.1 cycles
3.1 HEAD
My first random probe of a field added in 3.1,
IDebugUIConstants.ID_PROCESS_CONSOLE_TYPE, was missing it's @since 3.1 tag.
All committers need to be keeping this information up to date at all time.
Please review all API added across Debug plug-ins and ensure that they are
tagged properly.
