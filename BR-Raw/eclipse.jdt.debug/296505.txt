Bug 296505 – applet parameters can contain trailing spaces
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8; .NET CLR 3.5; ffco7) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8

If an applet parameter name ends with a trailing space, it's apparently
used "as is", including the space.
 This doesn't work, but is head-bangingly
mysterious as to why.
(I created one accidentally using cut-paste to copy the name.)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
type in a new parameter name foo   (include a trailing space
2.
start an applet that looks for "foo" (without the space)
3.
note that there's no match.
