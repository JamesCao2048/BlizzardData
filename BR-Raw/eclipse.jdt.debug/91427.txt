Bug 91427 – FIeldImpl could cache type() and typeName()
Doing some profiling of stepping in the debugger, and updating the variables
view, I found that FieldImpl does not cache its type or typeName.
These are
accessed repeatedly while updating the varibles view, and type() causes
communication with the target VM.
