Bug 11403 – Request timeout
The request timeout (timeout for a response to be received from a VM when ever
a JDI request is made), is currently surfaced in the IVMInstall
(#set/getDebugTimeout).
This is the wrong place for this attribute, as it is a
property of our proprietary JDI implementation.
I suggest that this timeout be specifyable on an IJavaDebugTarget basis
(set/get).
The API will state that if the underlying JDI imeplementation
supports a request timeout, it will be honoured, and we can even have a
#supportsRequestTimeout() method.
Then, I suuggest we make this attribute settable on a per launch configuration
basis, as that is what the user wants (i.e.
different request timeouts for
different launch configs).
For example, a remote debug session may require a
larger timeout than a local session.
