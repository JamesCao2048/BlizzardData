Bug 53102 – Breakpoint not installed though accepted by location verification
I had source code like:
context.getProject().log("resolving systemId: "
+ systemId, Project.MSG_VERBOSE);
A breakpoint on the second line is accepted by the location verification but
it is not installed.
A breakpoint on the first line works as expected.
