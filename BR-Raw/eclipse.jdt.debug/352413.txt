Bug 352413 – [1.7] Debugger should support binary literals and underscores while setting literals
Change value window in the debugger doesn't accept underscores in literals, whereas Java7 supports.
This is not important and probably unnecessary.
Only one use case I think that may make it necessary is - copy/paste the integer from code to this window.
