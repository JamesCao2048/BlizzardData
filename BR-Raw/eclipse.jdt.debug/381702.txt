Bug 381702 – [patch] executionEnvironments contributions should be sorted
Created attachment 216831 [details]
Fix for eclipse.jdt.debug repo
executionEnvironments contributions should be sorted.
Callers of IExecutionEnvironmentsManager.getExecutionEnvironments() which present the contributions in the UI should not reorder them.
Currently, EEs are sorted in various ways (by name, by ID, etc.), which is confusing.
The patch fixes the problems in the eclipse.jdt.debug repo.
jdt.ui and pde should follow up after this bug is fixed.
