Bug 369524 – 'Installed JREs > Search...' should also find JDKs from Developer Package
I20120123-1800, Mac OS X 10.7.2, follow-up to bug 325777
'Preferences > Installed JREs > Search...' should also find JDKs from Developer Packages.
Looks like the implementation currently only finds VMs in
/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
It should also search in
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
That's the place where Java Developer Packages from
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action are installed (search for 'Java').
These VMs are also listed by /usr/libexec/java_home -X
The Developer Packages are interesting because they also include source.
To add them in Eclipse today, you have to know the full path into the bundled folder.
The Directory...
chooser won't bring you there.
In my case, it was:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0_29-b11-402.jdk/Contents/Home
