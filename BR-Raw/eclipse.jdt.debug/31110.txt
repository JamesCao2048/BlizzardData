Bug 31110 – Debbugger Source Lookup does not work with variables
In the Debugger Source Lookup dialog I can also select variables for source
lookup.
(Advanced...
> Add Variables).
I selected the variable which points to
the archive containing the source file for the type, but the debugger still
claims that he cannot find the source.
