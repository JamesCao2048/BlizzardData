Bug 396795 – Prevent breakpoint detail panes from changing background colour on selection
1) Open breakpoints view with at least one breakpoint
2) Click on a breakpoint a few times
Result:
One each selection the background colour changes
The parent sashform colour is changed based on the detail pane colour.
 The detail pane colour currently depends on the sash form colour.
 This results in toggling each time.
Solution is to set the background colour explicitly.
