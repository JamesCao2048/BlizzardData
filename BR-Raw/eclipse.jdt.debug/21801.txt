Bug 21801 – ThreadGroupReference related data should be cached
In the current implementation of the JDI client, a jdwp command is send each
time the thread group of a thread, the name or the parent of a thread group is
asked.
These data are never modify (there is no API for that in the base java library),
they should be cached for reduce the number of jdwp command.
