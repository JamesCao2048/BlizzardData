Bug 53634 – Non-default JRE libraries don't work when running an application...
I2004-02-26
When switching to non-default JRE libraries (Preferences->Java->Installed JREs), e.g.
adding some
additional libraries, this has no effect when running the application.
The newly added libraries are not
added to the bootclasspath.
Same with removing libraries.
