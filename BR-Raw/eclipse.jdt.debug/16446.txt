Bug 16446 – Can't launch programs on Linux with default java executable name
1.
Select a launch config (Local Java App) and go to the JRE page.
2.
Click "New" and add a new JRE.
A new option appears to specify the name of
the Java executable.
The "Use default" button is selected.
Leave it that way.
3.
Try to launch the program.
An exception occurs.
I've debugged this enough to see that the command line we're trying to launch
is javaw.
javaw only exists in a few VMs.
If we want to look for it, that's
fine, but we need to fall back to java (or java.exe) if javaw is not found.
