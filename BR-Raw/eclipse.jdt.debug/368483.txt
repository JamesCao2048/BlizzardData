Bug 368483 – Mac OSX JDT launching plugin needs to check new VM locations on Snow Leopard and Lion
Build Identifier: 20100617-1415
running eclipse Helios 3.6 (64 bit) on Mac OS X (10.6.8).
java -version:
java version "1.6.0_29"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_29-b11-402-10M3527)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.4-b02-402, mixed mode)
GWT plugin, 2.4, installed.
On start up the 'initializing java tooling: 30%' status displays for about a minute if VPN (Cisco anyconnect) is running.
 < 2 seconds (or not at all) without VPN running.
Also, can get the SBOD (spinning beachball of death) if I have a GWT project with a run or debug configuration and try to edit it (or create one).
 Locks up the launch config dialog.
This happens with only one project in workspace (or more).
This happens with or without the split tunnel setup (multi-home).
Happens with Indigo or Helios, 32 bit or 64 bit.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Start the cisco VPN Anyconnect client
2.
Start eclipse
3.
Watch the 'initialzing java tooling' status for about a minute.
4.
Try creating a new Debug configuration for a GWT project.
5.
Watch the SBOD for about 20 minutes.
