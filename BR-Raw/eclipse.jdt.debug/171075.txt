Bug 171075 – Java Editor Disconnecting Debug Session
Build ID: Build id: M20060921-0945
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
As multi threading problem no easy way to reproduce
2.
Provided information and stack trace should allow problem investigation
More information:
Scenario/Symptom:
Remote debug session.
Clicking into the Java Editor might lead to a disconnection to the remote VM.
Severity major although obviously a rare problem, because it makes debugging impossible in affected scenarios.
We were confronted with a debug scenario in which the problem was reproducable within minutes.
This allowed following finding:
Involved classes
org.eclipse.jface.text.TextViewerHoverManager
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.JavaDebugHover
org.eclipse.jdi.internal.connect.PacketReceiveManager
What happens is:
The TextViewerHoverManager in the Java Editor tries to compute hover information content in a seperated Thread.
While debugging the JavaDebugHover is used.
The implementation tries to recieves information from remote VM.
By clicking in the Java Editor a TextEvent is created.
As a result the TextViewerHoverManager tries to force the termination of the current hover information computation by interrupting the related thread.
If in this moment the JavaDebugHover is receiving remote information waiting in PacketReceiveManager the PacketReceiveManager disconnects the VM connection.
