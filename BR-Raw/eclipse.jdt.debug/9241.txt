Bug 9241 – API - java launch configs should be headless
Currently, the launch configs for launching java programs (local, remote) live
in the java debug ui plug-in.
It would be good to have these in the core or
lanuching plug-in to allow headless launching.
Issues:
(1) source locator specification (UI source locator)
(2) error reporting (dialog, when verifying attributes)
