Bug 28304 – [variables] UnsupportedOperationException report to user on toString on WTK
WTK 2.0beta
Debug a program to a breakpoint
Select a variable
Get "java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException occurred invoking method." in the
details pane.
 We could handle this better.
 Could report "toString()
unavailable".
