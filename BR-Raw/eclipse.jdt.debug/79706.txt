Bug 79706 – Detail formatter fails in simple case
build I20041124-0800
- set a breakpoint on MenuManager.isVisible()
- start the IDE
- when the breakpoint is hit, add a detail formatter for MenuManager that has
just: getId()
- you get:
Detail formatter error: Unable to retrieve the correct enclosing instance of 'this'
At this point, there are no nested classes involved.
