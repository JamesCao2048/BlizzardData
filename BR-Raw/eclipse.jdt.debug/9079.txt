Bug 9079 – Pattern breakpoints show as <unknown>
Using the 0125 build, I created a pattern breakpoint in a JSP file using the
following:
JDIDebugModel.createPatternBreakpoint(file, pattern, line, -1, -1, 0, true,
null);
Two problems:
1) In the Breakpoints view, the breakpoint shows as "<unknown>".
2) No breakpoint marker appears in the JSP editor.
 (Using the 1.0 code base, I
only had to create the breakpoint to also get the marker.)
