Bug 275614 – REGRESSION: threads no longer expanded if Debug view not visible
I20090508-2000 and 3.5 M7
With a recent builds (including 3.5 M7) a bug was introduced into the Debug view: each time a debug session is started, it doesn't auto-expand the threads if the view is not visible on the screen.
Steps to reproduce:
1.
start new workspace
2.
choose to always switch to Debug perspective when launching
3.
open a second workbench window with only the Debug perspective
4.
switch back to the first workbench window with the Java perspective in it
(make sure the Debug window is behind the Java one)
5.
paste this code into the Package Explorer
while (true);
6.
start to Debug
==> the Debug view has its threads not auto-expanded
Can you please fix this for RC1: I run into this often because I use one fully expanded window for each perspective and hence see this bug quite often.
