Bug 94452 – Timeout exceptions
I20050509-2010
I am able to produce timeout exceptions by stepping in a method while a
logical structure is displayed for a Vector.
Stepping quickly - allow the UI
to start to update and then step again - seems to cause the problem.
I am not
holding down the step key.
This may be flooding the target with requests as
the views are attempting to update as the next step starts.
