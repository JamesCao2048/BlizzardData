Bug 83245 – [Breakpoint Groups] Improve icons for breakpoint type groups
With the fix to bug 75891 we can now provide custom adpaters for breakpoint
type categories.
We can use this to provide specialized images for the Java
breakpoint type categories.
I have requested artwork for the different
categories.
