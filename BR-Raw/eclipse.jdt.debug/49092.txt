Bug 49092 – 'User entries' classpath top element should be always displayed, even if empty
If the user classpath is empty (for example, a launch configuration without
project, or if the user removes everything),the 'User entries' top element is
not displayed when the classpath tab is recreated.
I see two problems:
- if a new user sees that, he won't know that there should be a 'User entries'
element.
- the only way I found to add back the element, is to select 'Restore Default
Entries', which delete all changes done on the boot classpath.
I think 'User entries' should be always displayed.
