Bug 77125 – Preference for suspending VM on breakpoint
build i1026.
You are able to configure a breakpoint's properties so it suspends either the
thread or the whole VM when it is hit.
I would like to have a preference so I can change my default to be the VM.
(useful when tracking down concurrency problems)
