Bug 188339 – [scrapbook] Expressions from scrapbook does not convert to watch expression correctly
I have this in a *.jpage file:
int result = -1;
int i=2;
switch (i)
{
case 0:
result = 0;
break;
case 1:
result = 2;
break;
case 2:
result = 4;
break;
default:
break;
}
return result;
I selected the entire code block and did an inspect using "CTRL + Shift + I".
I used the shortcut again to add the expression to the Expressions View.
When these statements are added to the expressions view, because the statement is so long, majority of the code is replaced by "..." in the middle.
I converted the expression to watch expression.
 The resulted watch expression contains "..." and the original code is lost.
