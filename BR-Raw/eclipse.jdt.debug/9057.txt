Bug 9057 – API - CHANGE event should be better specified
The CHANGE event is currently a catch all.
It could be better specified, and
perhaps have detail codes to make it more usable.
For example, if an element
fires a change event to update a label, there should be a way to specify that
only the label has changed, and not all of its children or the rest of the
target's state.
