Bug 12636 – Unable to get evaluation context for Scrapbook pages
Several users from the newsgroup have indicated that they can never use the
Java scrapbook as it always fails to retrieve an evaluation context.
I cannot reproduce the problem but am working with an individual to work out
what is going wrong.
