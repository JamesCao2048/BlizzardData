Bug 64696 – Allow interfaces in detail formatter
It would be great if the detail formatter would allow an interface to be
specified and all implementing classes would be displayed using this formatter.
I'd like to be able to specify a Debuggable interface with a debugString()
method that would be used as a detail formatter.
