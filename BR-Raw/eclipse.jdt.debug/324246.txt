Bug 324246 – Cannot pass the project classpath to external programs defined as builders
Build Identifier: 3.6.0 I20100608-0911
I defined an external program as a builder.
The external builder called java and the OpenJPA JPA enhancer.
The enhancer works from the JVM classpath.
However their is no variable defined that would allow you to pass the project classpath into the java -cp argument.
You have to enter it again.
It would be really good if there was a variable like ${project_classpath} perhaps that can take an argument, so you could do this ${project_classpath:${project_name}} and have it expand to the classpath
Reproducible: Always
