Bug 66453 – String concatenation gives unexpected result in conditional breakpoint expression
build I20040609-0800
- set a breakpoint in SWT's Decorations.restoreFocus() method
- make it conditional with the following condition:
System.out.println("restoreFocus savedFocus="+savedFocus);
return false;
- launch target and active and deactivate the target window a few times
- it prints something like:
restoreFocus savedFocus= (id=36)
- bug: this does not correspond to the savedFocus control's toString()
- change the condition to:
System.out.println("restoreFocus savedFocus="+String.valueOf(savedFocus));
return false;
- it now prints:
restoreFocus savedFocus=Tree {}
Expected behaviour:
- string concatenation in breakpoint expressions should work the same as regular
Java string concatenation: ("foo" + obj) is equivalent to ("foo" +
String.valueOf(obj)), or at least it used to be in JDK 1.3.
