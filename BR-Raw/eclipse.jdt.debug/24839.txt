Bug 24839 – TimeoutException debugging org.eclipse.ui.tests
build 20021015
I ran the UITestSuite of org.eclipse.ui.tests in debug mode and got the
attached log.
The TimeoutException at the top of the log was also printed in
the console.
I ran the same test suite in debug mode a few times before without problems.
