Bug 412982 – [breakpoints] conditional breakpoint should have condition "return false;" by default
When I enable the conditional breakpoint checkbox, I often use the "Debugging by writing to console" trick from the JDT Tips & Tricks:
System.out.println("some info");
return false;
It would save some typing if the line
return false;
would already appear by default.
This would also be a nice hint for new users that they should modify that expressions, since "return false;" is probably not the condition they actually need.
