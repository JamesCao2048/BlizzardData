Bug 159815 – isRemote(...) test performed 5 times for each variable selection
When a selection changes, the retargettable breakpoint actions update.
When a variable is selected we are resolving it's source element to determine if the variable correpsonds to a remote file (i.e.
in a repository).
The debugger never corresponds to a remote entity, so the test does not need to be performed.
We perform the resolution once for each retargettable action.
