Tooltip problems handling escaped &s, and Workbench title inconsistency
Build ID: IES 35I20090525
Steps To Reproduce:
This is a two fold problem.
First I'd like to suggest that tooltip labels simply ignore mnemonics and interpret &s directly.
I don't believe mnemonics make sense for tooltips...
The problems are:
1) Escaping the &s is not resulting in correct result in a tooltip
2) The escaped &s are not supported in the Eclipse Title bar.
The problem is most obvious when considering IEditorPart tooltips.
We have a tooltip for editing a UML operation in C++ context (i.e.
'&' indicates a reference to a variable).
Lets consider a C++ function:
int &&& op && ( int & test );
Our tooltip raw text for the 'UML' version is:
op && ( test : int & ) : int &&&
When we add some qualified names in there and we escape the &s we get something like:
CPPModel::Class1::op &&&& ( CPPModel::Class1::op &&&&::test : int && ) : int &&&&&&
When we launch an IEditorPart to allow the user to edit this element, we provide the above escaped text as the 'tooltip' text.
But, when we inspect the tooltip of the launched EditorPart now, we see:
CPPModel::Class1::op && ( CPPModel::Class1::op p::test : int i ) : int in
Compared to our expected:
CPPModel::Class1::op && ( CPPModel::Class1::op &&::test : int & ) : int &&&
Furthermore, the Eclipse Workbench window title is showing the escaped text:
CPPModel::Class1::op &&&& ( CPPModel::Class1::op &&&&::test : int && ) : int &&&&&&
Expected behavior is that the Workbench title bar will be the same as the tooltip.
And the tooltip either properly handles escaped &s, or it updated to not support mnemonics and thus will not require escaping of &s.
