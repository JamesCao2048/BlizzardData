Combo.setFocus() sets selection
I20080702-0939
Using the export wizard for "Runnable Jar File".
I want to type the export path myself instead of browsing.
As I'm on Linux my first letter is a "/" which causes jdt to show an error message for an invalid path and selecting the text of the textbox.
Changing selection while typing makes it impossible to enter a real path.
I think the wizard should not touch the selection of the text field.
