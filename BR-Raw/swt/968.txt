Eclipse won't launch using JDK 7 because SWT native libraries don't load
Eclipse fails to launch with the following exception when launching with JDK 7 (OpenJDK) from  https://jdk7.dev.java.net ):
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no swt-pi-cocoa-3547 or swt-pi-cocoa in swt.library.path, java.library.path or the jar file
at org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.loadLibrary(Library.java:248)
at org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.loadLibrary(Library.java:159)
As documented "here": http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/2009/05/eclipse-35-galileo-on-jdk-7.html  this problem can be circumvented by extracting the relevant jnilib files and putting them on the java.library.path
After stepping through the code it appears as if the problem is related to differences in the value returned from @System.mapLibraryName()@ on JDK7.  JDK7 returns libswt-cocoa-3548.dylib, whereas other Java VMs return libswt-cocoa-3548.jnilib.  Notice the difference in filename extension.  Technically though I believe that dylib is correct for Darwin, jnilib is returned by other VMs probably for historical reasons.
SWT is unable to load since libswt-cocoa-3548.dylib cannot be extracted onto the filesystem in @org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.extract(String, String)@, since it does not exist in the SWT jar.
SWT should either detect this case and attempt to load with the jnilib suffix, _or_ SWT should provide both jnilib and dylib files in the SWT jar.
Solving this issue would make it possible for Mac users to use an alternative Java VM to the one provided by Apple, thus enabling the use of 32-bit SWT on the mac platform.
