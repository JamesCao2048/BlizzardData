JVM (Eclipse) crash with SIGSEGV in ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
Build Identifier: I20120531-0600 (3.8 RC3)
While evaluating Eclipse 3.8 I'm observe sporadic VM crashes (once a day).
Common for all crashes is that they happen only with Eclipse 3.8 (Eclipse 3.7.0 running fine in same environment) and that the root cause is always:
# Problematic frame:
# C  [ld-linux-x86-64.so.2+0x8c0b]
I've googled and found only one related report  http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/m/875330/
There are also two closed / worksforme bugs:  bug 380710  and  bug 363491 .  Bug 380710   is also reported for 3.8.
Our environment is RHEL 5.8 64 bit, JVM is 1.7.0_04 from Oracle.
$uname -a
Linux socbl593 2.6.18-308.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 17:17:51 EST 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_04"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_04-b20)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.0-b21, mixed mode)
As we do not see similar crashes in our lab with ~50 people using Eclipse 3.7.0 every day (with the same environment!), I can only correlate the crashes to the newer Eclipse version.
Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
Please note, that half of the crash reports happens on VM shutdown. Typically I've seen it often on regular switch of the workspace or regular closing Eclipse.
I've also seen crashes where you simply move the mouse or switch to Eclipse and it disappears from the screen without any notice except the VM crash dump.
Interestingly, many crashes point to the same address ld-linux-x86-64.so.2+0x8c0b. Unfortunately I have no idea what this address could be.
In our case /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 is a symbolic link to /lib64/ld-2.5.so
$ file /lib64/ld-2.5.so
/lib64/ld-2.5.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, AMD x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
Any idea what it could be? Which additional information you would like to see?
