ToolItem names are not being reported to screen reader
Build id: N20081102-2000
- Run Eclipse
- Turn on VoiceOver
- Use Ctrl+Option+arrow keys to move the VoiceOver cursor (black rectangle) to a tool item in the Eclipse tool bar.
- VoiceOver should speak the name of the tool item (which is the same as the tooltip).
This works on Carbon, but I believe I had to just make tool items speak their tooltip (since most applications
- including Eclipse
- just use the same string for the tooltip and the tool item's accessible name).
I don't think I ever got the full SWT accessibility API working for tool items.
