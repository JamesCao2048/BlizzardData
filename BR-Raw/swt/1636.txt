Custom Combo: drop down menu is hard to use
The drop down menu of the Custom Combo uses a List widget which has a selection behavior that is not
suitable for menus because you have to hit the text in order to select an item. Clicking in the white space
after the text just dismissed the menu but doesn't select the item.
I suggest to use a Table instead of a List widget.
