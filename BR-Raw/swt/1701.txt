[Browser] crash on mouseover
When starting eclipse from a terminal the following is reported:
cjp@workstation6l:~> eclipse
libxcb: WARNING! Program tries to unlock a connection without having acquired
a lock first, which indicates a programming error.
There will be no further warnings about this issue.
libxcb: WARNING! Program tries to lock an already locked connection,
which indicates a programming error.
There will be no further warnings about this issue.
This only happens when eclipse is restarted after having created the AddressBook QT project, open the addressbook.ui and exiting eclipse.
Platform is openSuSE 10.3, eclipse not installed from distro but eclipse.org download.
