BIDI: owner draw: tool tips don't work with BIDI
N2008040417-2000.
In the upcoming build JDT now has support to render BIDI string labels (with the special chars). This also works when colored labels are enabled, however, the tool tip is not honoring those special chars and hence the tool tip is still broken.
Works if colored labels are disabled.
