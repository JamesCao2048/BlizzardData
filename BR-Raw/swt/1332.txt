Annotation underlines are not properly drawn when the end of the annotation range is not visible because the editor is not wide enough.
Steps:
- Paste to Package Explorer:
package xy;
class Test {
void m(void first, int looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooongName) {
}
}
- Make editor area so narrow that name of second parameter is not completely visible when editor is completely scrolled to the left.
- Close editor
- Open Test.java from Package Explorer
=> Problem range is "m(void first, int lo..ongName)", but underlines not visible (only appear when scrolling or setting caret into line 3)
