Cannot type in Text widget in an ON_TOP Shell
SWT Standalone version 3.2M3:
I've created a splash screen with a Label for the background image and a
composite containing a Label and Text widget each for Login and Password, and a
"Login" button.
(The shell has FormLayout, the composite has GridLayout).
It is not possible to type into the Text widget or delete characters.
It is possible to select text in the widget.
This seems to be an activation problem because if I click the shell (to activate
it) activation doesn't seem to work, and if I then type characters they go to
the previously activated window (e.g.
Eclipse Workbench).
If I remove the ON_TOP style bit I can again edit the text in the widgets.
According to release notes a similar looking bug was fixed in SWT Build 2.1 001
- Tuesday July 23, 2002, I cannot find the detailed bug report though:
