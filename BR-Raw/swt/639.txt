StyledText's AccessibleTextExtendedListener#getText() problems for TEXT_BOUNDARY_WORD
StyledText is returning some wrong values in AccessibleTextExtendedListener#getText() when the boundary type is
TEXT_BOUNDARY_WORD.
For example, "hello world" the word at 6 (count=0) was returning "hello"
I saw the problem running linux's accerciser tool.
