Display.post(Event) not working for char key events SWT.TAB, SWT.ESC, SWT.DEL and SWT.BS
I20050209-0800
Not sure whether this really is a bug since Display.post(Event) as spec'ed it
may return false: I filed a bug to clarify whether this return value means "not
supported" or "try again later" but got no answer yet ( bug 84665 ).
When using Display.post(Event) we found out that the following character key
events aren't injected under Linux-GTK: SWT.TAB, SWT.ESC, SWT.DEL and SWT.BS.
While we found workarounds for ESC (Alt+F4) and TAB (navigate via mnemonics) we
could not find anything similar for BS or DEL.
Injecting these events is important to use in order to performance test our
editors as close to the real world as possible.
