fillGradientRectangle doesn't work with XORMode on Windows
when you setXORMode(true), fillGradientRectangle ignores it on Windows.
It works as expected on Linux/gtk.  I'm using 3.0M8.
I will attach some sample code, and screenshots of what the same code produces
on Windows and on Linux/gtk.
Another weird thing is the label.addPaintListener() statement is only neccesary
on Windows, Linux/gtk works just fine without it.
