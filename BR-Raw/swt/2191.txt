Table Headers getting random images on Vista when cycling through sort indicator
This seems to be a variant on  bug 158982 .
If you have the sort indicators enabled on a table column (that contains images) and you cycle through the various states, a image will appear in the table column when the no sort state is reached (see attached picture). Will attach snippet.
