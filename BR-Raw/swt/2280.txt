GraphicsAntialiasingTab fails under both Motif and GTK
When selecting the GraphicsAntialiasingTab, the GraphicsExample application dies.
Steps for reproducing:
- Check out org.eclipse.swt.examples from CVS
- Put the attached file in your workspace under
org.eclipse.swt.examples.graphics
- Run the graphics example
- In the tree, expand "Antialiasing" and select "Graphics"
On Motif, the following output is displayed:
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
On GTK, the following output is displayed:
The application 'SWT' lost its connection to the display :0.0;
most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed
the application.
