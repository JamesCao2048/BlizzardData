Browser class shipped with AIX-Motif checks for Linux ?!?
I've recently downloaded the AIX-Motif version of the eclipse and tried to run
my plugin only to see it fail with "no more handles" error.
Checking the error I've discovered that the Browser class c'tor does:
public Browser(Composite parent, int style) {
super(parent,style | SWT.EMBEDDED);

if (!IsLinux) {
dispose();
SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_NO_HANDLES);
}
....
Being on AIX this code will always fail.
If a Browser class exists for AIX the file should be replaced in the packages
available for download.
If not, at least change the message to "not supported" at least. "no more
handles" was an extremly puzzling error ...
