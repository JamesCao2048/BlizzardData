org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleAutomation has a reference leak
On line 96, objITypeInfo is AddRef'd.  However, the semantics of GetTypeInfo has the returned ITypeInfo as an out parameter, and thus has already been AddRef'd.  The additional ref constitutes a reference leak.
I recommend changing the line to:
// TypeInfo is an out param, do not AddRef or this will leak.
Be happy to fix this one myself if I can get CVS access.
Thanks,
Scott
