Eclipse consistently hangs when I do this:
- open Keys preference page
- click into filter field and type "Show In (Pac"
- bind "Show In (Package Explorer)" to Command+P
=> in the Conflicts table, "Print" shows up
- click Print there
=> eclipse process uses a lot of CPU cycles and doesn't respond any more for at least several minutes
