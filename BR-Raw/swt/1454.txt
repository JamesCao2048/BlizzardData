StyledText: squiggles not drawn for tabs
R3.4 and 3.5 M1.
The squiggle drawing algorithm fails for tabs on WindowsXP (works on Linux-GTK).
Paste this into the Package Explorer to see the missing squiggles:
public class T {
void main() {
String s= "missing	squiggles		for		Tabs"
String s2= "squiggles    work    for    Spaces"
}
