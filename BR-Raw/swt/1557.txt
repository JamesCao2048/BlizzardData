Run Eclipse (at least I20080513-2000) and open an editor on any java file.
Turn on VoiceOver (command+F5).
Use the down arrow key to move the cursor down to the next line.
VoiceOver reads the whole file again, every time up or down arrow is typed.
Also: the ctrl+alt+L VoiceOver command should just read the current line,
but it reads the whole file.
I am not sure which attribute VoiceOver wants in order to determine what the current line is, but it is likely one of the following:
- kAXInsertionPointLineNumberAttribute (not a required attribute)
- kAXLineForIndexParameterizedAttribute (given a character index, return line#)
- kAXRangeForLineParameterizedAttribute (given a line#, return range of character indices)
