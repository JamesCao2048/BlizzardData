Child dialog gets in infinite flicker loop while use SWT.PRIMARY_MODAL style
Build Identifier: Version:3.6.1   Build id:M20100909-0800
If a child dialog (a dialog with SWT.PRIMARY_MODAL) is displayed, and then focus is switched out of that dialog then back on to the parent shell, the child dialog goes into an infinite flicker.
The best way I've been able to reproduce this is to use Expose to toggle away from application, then use Expose to send focus back to the parent shell.
This issue come out with 3.6.1 carbon swt, cocoa swt has no problem.
Reproducible: Always
