ToolTip takes a very long time to show when tooltip message is very long

Sample code
Create a ToolTip object, and set a very long text to its message. When we try to show this ToolTip, it takes a very long time. And during that time, there is no response for whole program. It seems to hang. But after tooltip finally shown, program will come back.
I attached the sample code in attachement.
