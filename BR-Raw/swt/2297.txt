TreeItem.getExpanded() does not work on Windows Mobile 2003
As the summary says, TreeItem.getExpanded() works fine on Windows XP but always returns false on Windows Mobile 2003
- see attached test case.
In my application I need to only process nodes that are showing their children for efficiency reasons so if you could fix this or provide a work around I would appreciate it.
