Custom draw problems with focus item in Tree and Table
HEAD
Custom drawn items in Trees and Tables have an incomplete or doubled dotted rectangle drawn around the item with keyboard focus.
E.g. Snippet236 misses the dotted line at the bottom.
Snippet232 has a doubled dotted line at right and should extend the blue selection background rectangle 1 px to the left and 1 px to the top.
If clients have to do anything to get the focus rect right, then this should be documented ( bug 81334 ).
