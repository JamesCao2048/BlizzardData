Tab traversal broken in 64-bit ToolBar
After switching the SWT code to 64-bit by default, a missing int /*long*/ in ToolBar.hasKeyboardFocus(int inId) causes the method not to be called by any of the keyboard methods in Control.
This breaks tab traversal in toolbars.
The correct code should be: hasKeyboardFocus(long /*int*/ inId).
