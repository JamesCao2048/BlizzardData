Button.computeSize definition on Mac does not match other platforms
3.1M1
Button.computeSize() on carbon adds a 4 pixel padding factor to any size hints
passed in.  I think this padding may be added to compensate for the large
internal border given to buttons, but this does not match the behaviour of other
platforms.  I think this should be cleaned up.
