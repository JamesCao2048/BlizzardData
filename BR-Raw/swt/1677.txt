Steps To Reproduce:
1.Open Control example
2.Choose 'Shell' tab
3.Select SWT.TITLE, SWT.CLOSE, SWT.MIN, SWT.MAX
4.Click 'Create Shell'
Notice that close and minimize buttons are visible, but the normally green maximize button appears grayed out, just as it does when SWT.MAX is not selected.
Screenshot attached.
