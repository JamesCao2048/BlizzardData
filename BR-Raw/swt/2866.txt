Popup menu doesn't work when dialog opened via short cut
N20050520-0100
The new open type dialog has a context menu for the entries in the list as well
as one that shows up if the little triangle in the top right corner is pressed.
Both menus don't work if the dialog is opened via the short cut (Ctrl+Shift+T).
They do work if the dialog is opened via the open type tool bar button in the
global tool bar.
