GC stops drawing after setting transform with dy=-1
Build ID: Build id: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Set a transform with dy=-1 on a GC
2. Try to draw a line. Nothing will appear, and further drawing operations will silently fail too
Example code:
Transform transform = new Transform(gc.getDevice(), 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1);
gc.setTransform(transform);
gc.drawLine(0, 0, 100, 100);  //==> line will not appear!
If I change dy=-1 to -1.5f, everything works correctly. With values near -1.0 (like -1.0001), the drawing is grossly inaccurate.
The bug seems to be in GC.checkGC(): it contains a line
data.gdipYOffset = 0.5f / scaling;
That line gets executed with scaling==-0.0. Then data.gdipYOffset becomes -Inf ==> GC is toast!
