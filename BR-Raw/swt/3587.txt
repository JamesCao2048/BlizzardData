Photon - implement the SWT browser widget
Provide an implementation of the new SWT browser widget for the QNX platform.
Stubs:
The org.eclipse.swt source from HEAD contains stubs for the Browser widget on
Photon.
Source folders:
Eclipse SWT Browser/photon (org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser for photon - to be
implemented)
Eclipse SWT Browser/common (events which must be supported by the Browser
widget)
1. report if part of the Browser api and events don't map to the Photon
platform
2. for early feedback, you can post a (temporary) simplified version of the
Browser which does not support the events.
3. The final implementation can be tested against the following snippet:
