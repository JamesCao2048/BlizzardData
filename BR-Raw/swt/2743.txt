List control bug [cheese when resizing]
Two list controls on a sashform and I want to show the selected item
even after the list control is resized. I've added a resize listener to both
list control and called showSelection() method. In some situation the list
items are doubled, see attached image.
I posted a bug report since I didn't got any answer on the newsgroup.
