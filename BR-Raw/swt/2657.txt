window dimensions are tiny
jdk 1.5 (64-bit)
I20051011 gtk (64-bit)
linux-amd64
when trying to start eclipse, all windows that come up are only a few pixels
wide/high, regardless of what the size the window was when closing.
this is a blocker because the 'select workspace' dialog is not resizable.
since
you can't select a workspace, eclipse won't start.
