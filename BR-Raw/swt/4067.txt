Preference page does not expand to fit all widgets
Build 20020607
Linux-GTK
The preference page dialog often does not expand enough to fully display
all the widgets it contains. We've only been able to reproduce this problem
on Linux-GTK, where it happens quite frequently. Just opening the
preference page and clicking through on various pages, you're pretty much
guaranteed to see the problem.
Since the platform UI code seems to work as expected on other platforms, it
looks like either the GTK widget isn't growing as much as the UI is
requesting or the widgets aren't reporting their true required size.
