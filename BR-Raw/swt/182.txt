Extremely wide combo box causes X11 crash

screenshot of broken "Main" tab
Eclipse SDK 4.2 updated to 4.3.0.I20120810-1300
Using "Classic" theme on Kubuntu.
One particular tab in PDE's run configuration dialog ("Main") is badly broken since recently (perhaps after updating to M1):
- the content pane is extremely wide, a horizontal scroll bar with a tiny handle appears.
- I'm suspecting a combo box to have a finger in the pie because
- it shows a part on the very left and another part on the very right,
in-between the combo-box is not drawn at all.
- when I click that combo box the application reprocuceably crashes with:
The program 'Eclipse' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
(Details: serial 84294 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
Switching to Gtk theme doesn't fix the problem.
Following the instruction in the error message didn't succeed to stop the debugger at the error, since gdk_x_error() was not resolved by gdb.
