[Accessibility] Accessible relations don't show up in accessibility inspector
I20100504-0800
The two examples for relations aren't working on Cocoa.
AccessibleRelationsExample and AccessibleRelationsExample2 demonstrate the addRelation method, and on Cocoa this means that the Accessible in RELATION_LABEL_FOR should show up as an element in the  NSAccessibilityServesAsTitleForUIElementsAttribute list, and the Accessible in the RELATION_LABELLED_BY slot should appear as NSAccessibilityTitleUIElementAttribute.
Neither of these are showing up in Accessibility Inspector.
