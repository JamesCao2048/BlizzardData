Switching to a not yet activated perspective doesn't set focus an on any view
I2002-12-18
Using Cmd-F8 to switch to a view that has not yet been activated during the session
doesn't set the input focus on any view.
This results in keyboard commands not being
processed (e.g.
Cmd-F8 again).
This can be reproduced by
- Opening two perspectives
- Restarting Eclipse
- Pressing Cmd-F8 to switch to next perspective
- After the perspective is displayed pressing Cmd-F8 has no result
