Cannot Uppercase text CCombo in VerifyListener
Build Identifier: 20090920-1017
When a user types characters in a CCombo, I would like those characters to be forced into upper case.
In a Text field this is accomplished by adding a VerifyListener.
The event handling code for CCombo does not allow the listener to override the text in the verify event.
This is a simple fix, the method "CCombo.textEvents()" needed to be modified for the VerifiedEvent to add "event.text = e.text" after the listeners have been notified as follows:
case SWT.Verify: {
Event e = new Event ();
e.text = event.text;
e.start = event.start;
e.end = event.end;
e.character = event.character;
e.keyCode = event.keyCode;
e.stateMask = event.stateMask;
notifyListeners (SWT.Verify, e);
event.doit = e.doit;
event.text = e.text;
break;
}
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add a VerifyListener to a CCombo that is editable.
2.Uppercase the event text in the verify Listener.
3.Text in the Combo box is not uppercased.
