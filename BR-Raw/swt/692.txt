StyledText: Incorrect style.length in paintObject events
Build Identifier: M20100211-1343
After setting a StyleRange with a length of 1 and a non null glyph metrics on a StyledText, the paint events received by paint listeners have an event such that event.style.length = 0.
This seems to come from the way int array ranges are computed and interpreted in StyledTextRenderer vs TextLayout:
- in TextLayout.getRanges() the int[] array is said (javadoc) to contain the "start and end of each text style", and for a style with a length of 1 the array contains [...,
<start>,<start>, ...].
Also the setStyle implementation shows that those offsets are inclusive.
- however in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine (end of the method when styles[i].metrics != null) the int[] array obtained from the layout is assumed to contain
<start>,<start+1> since the style length is computed as
int length = ranges[(i
<< 1) + 1]
- ranges[i
<< 1];
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
StyledText styledText = new StyledText(parent, SWT.MULTI);
StyleRange range = new StyleRange(10, 1, fg, bg);
range.metrics = new GlyphMetrics(ascent, descent,25 );
styledText.setStylesRanges(new StyleRange[] { range  };
2.Observe that event.style.length == 0 when the listener is invoked
