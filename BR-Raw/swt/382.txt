[Mac OS X] Cannot enable/disable breakpoint by clicking checkbox
Build id: I20110428-0848 (Eclipse 3.7 M7, Cocoa 32-bit)
Running on Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Java 1.5.0_28
1.Open a Java file and add a breakpoint
2.Switch to the Debug perspective
3.Try to disable the breakpoint by clicking the checkbox
in the Breakpoints view
--> not possible
Note that the breakpoint's table row will be deselected on mouse up.
If previsouly not selected, it will be selected on mouse down and then deselected on mouse up.
Interestingly, enabling and disabling works when holding down the alt/option key.
The context menu actions also work.
Marked as a blocker, because I think 3.7 should not be shipped with this bug.
