Tree with lines visible not painted correctly
Background: I used the TableTree in my application up to now. Since it is marked
as deprecated in Eclipse 3.1, I tried to replace it with the tree widget using
columns.
When using columns in the Tree widget with setLinesVisible(true), not all lines
are painted as in the old TableTree. Only the lines of rows with content are
shown, but not those lines of rows with no content. Furthermore the lines are
totally invisible while rearraning the size of a column. In my opinion the lines
should be always shown in the widget if setLinesVisible is set to true.
