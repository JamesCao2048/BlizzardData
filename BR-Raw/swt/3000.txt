Selected and disabled tool item looks enabled

When you disable a tool image what is selected it appears as enabled with a
stippled background.  I expected it to appear greyed out like
unselected/disabled items.
From the sync view:
1. select outgoing mode
2. enable change sets
3. select conflicts mode
4. Observe the change sets button looks enabled (see screenshot)
I will create a snippet when i get a chance.
