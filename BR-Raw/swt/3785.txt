Entire Eclipse Platform loses focus and goes into the background...
I have Windows 2000, JDK 1.4.0_01, Eclipse 2.1 M5 build.
The steps detailed below cause Eclipse to go to the background and relinquish
foreground visibility to any application that it was on top of.
0. Open Eclipse on top of someother application.
----------------------------------------------------
1. Open a Java file in the Java Perspective.
2. Go to a valid functional block (such as inside a method) and type "String."
3. Wait for Code Assit to come up (or invoke it yourself).
4. Use your mouse to select(single-click) any method (such as valueOf(char c))
[If you look close you will see the Eclipse Platform gives focus to Code
Assist, which is fine but is probably the source of the problem]
5. Wait for the Hoover Help to show the Javadoc of the method to the right of
Code Assit.
6. Use your mouse to click on the Hoover Help Javadoc.
You should now see the other application (from step 0) in the foreground and
eclipse in the background.
This is probably a problem with any other perspective as well, and is a problem
for any Code Assist(not just String).
I'm not sure if Eclipse is attempting to launch my web browser to show the
Javadoc (but it doesn't).
