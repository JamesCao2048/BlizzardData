Combo#cut() does not place deleted text to clipboard

Combo#cut() does not place the deleted text to the clipboard on the Mac. In fact, it just deletes the selected text.
I've just lost a worthy regular expression I wanted to cut&paste from the Find/Replace dialog (Command+X calls cut() in Eclipse).
