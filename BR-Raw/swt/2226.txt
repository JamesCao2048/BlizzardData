[DND] 'Alt' does not request DROP_LINK
SWT Drag and Drop on Windows requests a link when pressing ctrl+shift, but not when pressing alt.
It would be nice to support requesting the DROP_LINK operation when pressing alt since some windows users are used to create links by pressing alt, and might not even be aware that ctrl+shift also works (like me some ten minutes ago :) ).
This bug can easily be reproduced by running a DNDExample like:
