Cannot get focus out of browser widget any more
I20080502-0100, was OK in M5.
Cannot get focus out of browser widget any more. To reproduce, e.g. launch ControlExample, tab into the browser widget and then try to get out by keyboard.
- Tab and Shift+Tab used to pass focus out after the last/first link was selected (worked fine in M5, broken in M6 and in HEAD)
- Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab already didn't work in M5
This is an accessibility problem. E.g. in Javadoc hovers (opened with F2 in a Java editor), you cannot reach the toolbar buttons any more.
