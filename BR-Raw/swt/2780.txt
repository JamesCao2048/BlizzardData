ImageData.getTransparencyMask - incorrect javadoc or implementation wrong
The implementation of getTransparencyMask appears to return a fully opaque
mask when the image has no transparency. The javadoc seems to infer that it
would return null in that case.
/**
* Returns an <code>ImageData</code> which specifies the
* transparency mask information for the receiver, or null if the
* receiver has no transparency and is not an icon.
*
* @return the transparency mask or null if none exists
*/
public ImageData getTransparencyMask()
(see implementation of ImageData.colorMask)
On a different note, should we return a transparent mask based on the the
alphaData values with the 127 threshold?
