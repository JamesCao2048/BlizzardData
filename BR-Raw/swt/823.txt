[Widgets] Windows 7: small indeterminate ProgressBar looks broken
I20090929-0800 on Windows 7.
When the indeterminate ProgressBar is small (like in the Eclipse status bar) then it does not go to the end and hence looks broken.
Test Case:
1.start SWT Control Example
2.switch to 'ProgressMonitor' tab
3.check style SWT.INDETERMINATE
4.make the progress bar narrow (same size as in the status line of the Eclipse
workbench window)
==> the progress indication does not go to the end which looks broken.
This looks fine on XP and Vista.
Most likely a native issue but something we need to fix or workaround as it is very prominent in the status line of each Eclipse workbench window.
Side note: the normal (non-indeterminate) Windows 7 progress bar seems to be more precise/accurate which makes it very visible if end values are not correctly set when an operation is finished (looks like the operation doesn't reach its end).
That however, is a problem that has to get fixed on the client side.
