Tracker leaves cheese
1. Run the attached test case.
2. In the text portion of the window, press and hold down mouse button 1.  Move
the mouse some while still keeping mouse button 1 down.
3. While mouse button 1 is still down, press Alt-Tab.  Go to a window other
than Eclipse.  Let go of the mouse.
At this point there is cheese in the test case window and perhaps on the window
selected in Step 3.  Similar behavior occurs in Eclipse when a view pane is
dragged.  The test case mimics what Eclipse is doing.  Is this a bug or do we
need to do something more to get the Tracker to not leave cheese?
