[PerspectiveBar] Alignment of items in perspective switcher when switcher docked to the left is incorrect
Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Eclipse 3.0.2 SDK
2. From perspective switcher, select Dock On > Left
3. Open a few perspectives - PDE, Java, CVS, etc...
3. On Windows, all the perspectives are left-aligned. However, on linux the
perspectives are center-aligned.
This looks pretty ugly. Behaviour of perspective switcher on linux should match
the behaviour on Windows.
To give you some background on why Im making this request - In the WebSphere
Everyplace Deployment runtime, I've morphed the perspective switcher
(org/eclipse/ui/internal/PerspectiveSwitcher) to a launcher which allows users
to navigate between and run various applications deployed to the runtime. I'd
like for the application (our perspectives) icons to be stacked one on top of
the other and be left-aligned. For reference, this launcher is similar to what
is used in Lotus Workplace Client.
I am using the default style used by the workbench for the perspective
switcher - SWT.FLAT | SWT.WRAP | SWT.RIGHT | SWT.HORIZONTAL. I tried various
permutations and combinations of these style bits but I cant get the
perspectives to left-align on Linux GTK.
