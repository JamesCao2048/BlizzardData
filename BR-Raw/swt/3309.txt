Progress bars use deprecated style
Progress bars are set to be GTK_PROGRESS_DISCRETE unless the calling code uses
the  SWT.SMOOTH style:
/*
* Note: this API is deprecated, but there is no replacement.
*/
int barStyle = (this.style & SWT.SMOOTH) == 0 ?
OS.GTK_PROGRESS_DISCRETE : OS.GTK_PROGRESS_CONTINUOUS;
OS.gtk_progress_bar_set_bar_style (handle, barStyle);
The discrete-style progress bars are deprecated in Gtk+ and all progress bars
should use the continuous style:

<vektor_wrk> owen: progress_bar_set_bar_style is deprecated.
Does this mean all progress bars should be continuous?

<owen> vektor_wrk: Yep

<vektor_wrk> weird :)

<owen> vektor_wrk: Why weird?

<owen> it's weird that an app could control it ...
I think we should follow Gtk+ conventions and always use smooth progress bars.
The fix is to just remove the call completely.
