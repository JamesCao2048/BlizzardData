Carbon vertical Scale widget has top/bottom reversed from other platforms
A Scale widget with SWT.VERTICAL style has larger values at the top and smaller values at the bottom in
Carbon, but larger values at the bottom and smaller values at the top in GTK+ and Win32.
This makes it harder to present a consistent interface behavior across platforms, particularly for things
like volume sliders which have a clear conventional direction.
