Deadlock creating image outside UI thread
I20040121
I got a deadlock today while performing a manual workspace build (Ctrl+B).
The
stack trace shows that it is trying to create an Image instance outside of the
UI thread.
This is causing it to block on a GTK OS primitive (presumably because
the main thread currently holds some mutex on the UI).
I will attach the log
file.
Image javadoc doesn't seem to specify that Images must be created in the
UI thread.
