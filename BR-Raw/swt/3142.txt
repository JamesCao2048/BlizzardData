Setting cursor to SWT.CURSOR_APPSTARTING doesn't seem to work
The new sync view now shows the SWT.CURSOR_APPSTARTING cursor whenever
background jobs are running that effect the contents of the view. This cursor
appears on WinXP but does not appear on GTK. We are using setCursor on a tree
or table control. To try it out, open the Team/Synchronize view and perform a
refresh (left most toolbar button) in a workspace with some projects laoded
from CVS.
