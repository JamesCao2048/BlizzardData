Menu images (PNG) does not support semi-alpha-transparency on Windows Vista/7
Created  attachment 148732   [details]
the edge of such a semi-transparent PNG icon
I'm using PNG images with some alpha-transparency (especially the border is
drawn not fully opaque but with a soft gradient into the transparent
background).
The icons are displayed correctly in toolbars or coolbars, but on Windows
Vista/Windows 7 the icons are displayed ugly inside the menubar-dropdown menu
...
the transparent icon border is drawn in black and not filled with the
current background color.
The implementation looks like:
* create JFace Action: org.eclipse.jface.action.Action with the desired
ImageDescriptor to set the icon
* add the JFace action instances
a) either to a MenuManager
b) or to a ToolBarManager (optionally wrapped inside a CoolBarManager)
...
a) does look ugly
...
b) does look fine.
