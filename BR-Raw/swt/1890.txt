Custom caret problems
M200409080800 (3.0.1)
-open Java editor with source
-turn off "Smart Insert Mode" via Edit menu
Observe: the caret should have a gap in the center (that's OK, no problem here)
- move caret horizontally with cursor keys
Observe: sometimes caret "sticks" to old position and you get a new caret at the new position,
so effectively two carets are visible (but only one blinks).
- pull down a menu from the menubar so that the menu covers the area where the caret is
Observe: the caret draws on top of the menu
