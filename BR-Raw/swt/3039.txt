TextLayout preferred size depends on current width
Eclipse 3.1 M5
Run the ControlExample
Go to the Link tab
Select 50x50 from the Size Area
Select Preferred from the Size area
Notice that the Link widget is still 50 pixels wide and wrapped to multiple lines.
It should be one long
line.
Felipe says this is a bug in TextLayout on carbon.
The call
setLayoutControl(OS.kATSULineWidthTag, OS.Long2Fix(width), 4);
is not doing the right thing when the width is
-1.
