ACC: Checkboxes in lists are not real checkboxes
Options in the list look like checkboxes but the aren't real checkboxes.
MS
Inspect identfies the Role as 'list item' instead of checkbox.
The Filters List page contains a Table component, and one of the
columns cell editor is a CheckboxCellEditor;
(this is similar with the Task List view, where the 'completed'
column cell editor is a CheckboxCellEditor)
With the current CheckboxCellEditor implementation
there's no way to add a real checkbox component into the
table; you have to specify two icons to be used by
the enable/disable state
