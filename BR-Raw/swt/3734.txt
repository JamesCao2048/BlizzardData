Tab Event weirdly handled in motif
This is similar to  bug 33495  except it occurs on motif and the symptoms are
different. The problem is that if the user assigns a command to the Tab key on
motif, the action is performed, but focus transfers to the buttons in the toolbar.
To reproduce:
1) Get Eclipse for Linux/Motif/RC2
2) Unzip and run it (with a fresh workspace)
3) Open the Keys preference page
4) Set (for example) the Line Down action to Global scope, Standard config, and
Key seq 'Tab'
5) Open up a new project (call it test) and a new file (call it test.txt)
6) Press enter, followed by up arrow in the new file
7) Press the 'Tab' button
8) Notice how focus transfers to the first button in the toolbar.
9) Press the 'Tab' button a few more times
10) Notice how focus transfers along the toolbar and eventually returns to the
editor
11) Notice how once focus is transferred back to the editor the cursor is on the
next line.
This occurs for me on debian/unstable and was discovered due to a user
attempting to use the TabNavigator plugin from zclipse.org.
