Checkbox Table Column header not quite wide enough
Run ControlExample.
Go to Table tab and click CHECK and Header Visible *in that order*.
Notice that the first column header (for Name) has a 1-pixel sliver of white along the left-hand side.
(Note that if you check Header Visible and then CHECK, the column header size is correct).
