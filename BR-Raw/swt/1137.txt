This is with I20090304 + HEAD of SWT from about 11 a.m. PST on 3/6.
1. Set up mylyn so you have a task list from the Eclipse bugzilla
2. Run a query so the task list is populated.
3. View results.
--> Task status icons are first drawn at the far left of the row and again in the correct spot.
See attached screen shot.
