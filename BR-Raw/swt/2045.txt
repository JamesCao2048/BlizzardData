I20070323-1616 (M6)
The Java editor sometimes flashes when extending a selection by word with Ctrl+Shift+Right.
Steps:
- new workspace
- copy attachment into clipboard
- paste to Package Explorer
- set caret to before first 'res.add(...'
- press Ctrl+Shift+Arrow_Right until selection is
'res.add(new BindingProperty(this, "CONSTANT VALUE", const' (the editor automatically scrolls, so you will only see
'(new BindingProperty(this, "CONSTANT VALUE", const' selected)
- now repeatedly press Ctrl+Shift+Arrow_Right, then Ctrl+Shift+Arrow_Left to include/exclude 'Val '
=> The whole editor area and the horizontal scroll bar flash on every keystroke
