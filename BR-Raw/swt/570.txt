Carbon: DnD fails when dropping object to a child control.
Build Identifier: SWT v3646a
DnD fails when dropping object to a child control.
So far, we see this issue on Carbon/Mac OS X.
Windows works.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Composite and setup DropTarget for it.
2.Create a child control in the Composite.
3.Drop an object to the child control.
result:
the dropped object ignored, and DnD fails.
problem:
The bug is in DropTarget.FindDropTarget().
The bug happens because DropTarget.FindDropTarget() thinks the DnD object dropped to the child control, But, since the child control's getData() returns null, the line "return (DropTarget) widget.getData(DND.DROP_TARGET_KEY);" returns null.
It should return correct parent in this case.
