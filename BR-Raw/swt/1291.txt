[Cocoa] Image radio and check buttons don't display state
Build id: I20081030-1917
You may be aware of this one, but Image buttons don't display their selection state. They do correctly set state and appear to function properly otherwise.
1. Show the SWT Examples Control Example view.
2. Go to button parameters / styles.
3. Select an image button.
Toggle button does reflect state (perhaps this needs but it is not so pretty. :) Note there is a shimmer when state is selected; assume that has something to do with forcing the buttons to stay selected. I'm not sure what the best solution for this is or if Apple even has guidance. My feeling is that all of these should not use Aqua style buttons, but should be displayed unadorned when not selected and indented when selected ala the tool bar buttons. Ideal would be something like the ITunes view selection or perhaps Inspector Tabs in Apple Apps, but not sure how that fits with JFace API.
