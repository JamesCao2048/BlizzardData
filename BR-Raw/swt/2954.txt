Context menu shows twice in combo box.
When setting your own menu , then right clicking on a combo box, you get the
default one from the os , and the one you set.  There is no break in the case
statement in the windowProc method in Combo.
case OS.WM_CONTEXTMENU:		result = wmContextMenu (hwnd, wParam, lParam);
