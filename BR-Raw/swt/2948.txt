Support very large Image on Windows platform
Currently an Image on Windows is size-limited - on my system to 16MB.  However,
a posting in eclipse.platform.swt in response to "Larger image problems"
suggested that there is a way to get OS.CreateCompatibleBitmap to transparently
return a DIB that is stored in main memory and can be any size.  If there is a
way to easily support this, it'd be really helpful.
