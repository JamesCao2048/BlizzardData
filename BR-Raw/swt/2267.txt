Web services wizard scale and graph all weird
Driver:  wtp-sdk-M-1.5.1-200609150551.zip
When I bring up the Web service wizard with this driver, the client scale is all red and the graphic for the service and client scale is partiall grey.

Andrew said he saw similar problem with the 0914 driver on SLES 9.0 yesterday but the problem went away with a different JDK.
I'm using "J2RE 1.4.2 IBM Windows 32 build cn142ifx-20060209 (SR4-1)" when I saw that problem on Windows XP.
I had been using the same JRE before on WTP drivers and did not see this problem.
We'll do a bit more problem isolation to see which JDK seems to be causing the problem and which one don't.
We did not make any change in this area in recent weeks.
