Typing text in Spinner does not change value
Build id: I20090312-0100
Run ControlExample and go to Spinner tab.
Use the mouse to click on the little arrows - the text increments and decrements as expected.
(for example, up, up, up goes to 3, then down, down goes to 1).
Leave the value at 1 and go to to next step...
Select the text in the text field and type a very different number, say 27.
Now use the mouse to go up or down... note that clicking down goes to 0 and up goes to 2.
(should be 26 and 28).
Another test case:
- use the mouse to change the value to 5
- select the text and type 33
- type TAB
- after the spinner loses focus, the value goes back to 5
Another test case:
- use the mouse to change the value to 4
- select the text and type 22
- click on the Set/Get API button
- Note that the value is 4, and not 22... but the Spinner still shows 22
(What is also interesting is that if you type in a new value and then *type* an up or down arrow key, then the typed value does become the real value, and the value is incremented or decremented correctly).
