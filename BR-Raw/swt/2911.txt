GC.setLineStyle produces inconsistent dash for width equal 1
Executing the attached snippet shows that line styles of varying widths
are consistent and in proportion with one another EXCEPT when the
width on the line equals one.
This is also shown in the attached screenshot.
For example, with SWT.LINE_DOT style a line width of 3 produces a line with
3x3 pixels on and a gap of 3x3 pixels off.
When the width is 2, you get
2x2 pixels on, 2x2 pixels off.
With a width of 1 you'd expect 1x1 pixel on,
followed by 1x1 pixel off, but you get 3x1 on, 3x1 off.
The screenshot also shows a similar disproportion with LINE_DASHDOT.
