NPE when removing an item from a Table with custom draw hooks
We are using a Table with hooks to handle SWT.MeasureItem and SWT.PaintItem.
When an item is being deleted from this table, a NPE is thrown because getBounds is invoked on an already disposed TableItem.
The stack trace looks as follows:
Thread [main] (Suspended (exception NullPointerException))
TableItem.getBounds(int, int, boolean, boolean, boolean, boolean, int) line: 234
Table.sendMeasureItemEvent(TableItem, int, int, int) line: 2904
Table.CDDS_SUBITEMPREPAINT(int, int) line: 481
[ ...
removed ...
]
Table.remove(int[]) line: 2445
A bit more detailed:
1) The item is being released and OS.LVM_DELETEITEM sent afterwards
2) This leads to Table.CDDS_SUBITEMPREPAINT being called,
which in turn sends out a MeasureItem event
3) sendMeasureItemEvent will call item.getBounds on the already disposed item
4) getBounds accesses item.parent, which is null, because the item is disposed
