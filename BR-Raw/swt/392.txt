JVM crash log
3.7M4, 32bit Win7
This is weired.
I have a new workspace with a new plug-in created from the empty RCP template with branding.
When starting the thing I get a JVM crash.
I have Mylyn in my target platform and it looks like that Mylyn is also triggered in the RCP app and wants to access something in the TaskBar.
