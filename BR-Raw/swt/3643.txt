regression - Table.getImageBounds returns incorrect value
Take the propertysheet as an example. If you select a project and try to click
on the +/- next to the "Info" category entry, it won't expand/collapse.
In this particular case if you click just on the upper-left corner of the box
around the +/- you may be able to get it to work. But if you click anywhere else
it won't work.
In this particular case, TableTreeItem.getImageBounds() was returning a box that
was lower than where you were clicking such that the event location only
overlapped the image bounds at the upperleft corner.
However, there is also a problem in that getImageBounds() doesn't return a
rectangle with any dimensions many times. With the standard properties for
things like project, there are no expandable properties other than the "info"
category. But in our editor (Java Visual Editor) we have many such properties.
And during testing, even though there were some entries that showed a +/-, the
getImageBounds() returned a zero-sized rectangle for all of them. Though it
wasn't consistent. It would return zero-sized most of the time, but not all of
the time.
This makes the property sheet unusable for expanded properties and categories.
