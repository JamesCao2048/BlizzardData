StyledText has problems with layout in the presence of ligatures
[3.6.0 and 3.6.1]
Create a mini snippet with just a StyledText in a shell:
StyledText styledText = new StyledText(shell, SWT.V_SCROLL
| SWT.H_SCROLL);
Enter the following characters and observe where the cursor moves after each character:
abcdeffg
Note that after entering the second 'f' the cursor is in the wrong position. Happens for the ligature 'fi' as well.
