StyledText - bidi - change ctrl-arrow behavior
After skipping to the next or previous word (using Ctrl+Right/Left arrow),
the keyboard language must be set corresponding to the first character of the
word.
Caret Positioning after Next/Previous Word:
Rule: after skipping to the Next or Previous word (using Ctrl+Right/Left
arrow), the caret should precede the first logical character of the word.
Start with a line containing  abc def GHI JKL MNO pqr stu   displayed as  abc
def ONM LKJ IHG pqr stu
When starting on the left and pressing Ctrl+Right arrow repeatedly, the caret
should stop on the left of d, then on the right of G, then on the right of J,
then on the right of M, then on the left of p, then on the left of s.
When starting on the right and pressing Ctrl+Left repeatedly, the caret should
stop at the same positions in reverse order.  Practically, Ctrl+Left behaves as
required, but Ctrl+Right misbehaves at the transition from a LTR word to a RTL
word: stops on the left of O instead of the right of G.
