setExpanded(false) doesn't work when tree item is not visible (regression)
Build: I20061024
1) Expand a project with many children in the Navigator or Package Explorer view
2) Scroll the view down so that the project root tree item is not visible, but the children are still visible
3) Click "Collapse All" in the view tool bar.
-> Nothing happens. The root element only collapses if it is visible, or if none of its children are visible.  Reproduced the problem on XP, Win2K, and Vista.
I suspect this is a problem in AbstractTreeViewer.collapseAll.
