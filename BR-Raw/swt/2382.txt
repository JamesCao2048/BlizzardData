swt.FileDialog: additional clarification in javadoc and convenience method
I was recently working out an issue with some code using the SWT FileDialog
class.  The soon-to-be-attached patch adds some additional information to the
javadoc which explains some details I gleaned from reading the source but wasn't
quite clear from the existing javadocs.
The patch also adds a new method for setting the filter names and extensions
which I believe is more convenient to use.
I created the patch against the GTK version of SWT.  It will need to be adapted
for the other versions.  (note: by "adapt" I merely mean that the line numbers
need to be adjusted, none of the code is platform-specific)
