StyledText deletes too many characters in some situations
The following situation reproduces the problem. In a styled text with double
click word selection, enter the following text:
hello world
hi there!
what happen!?
Include an extra empty line after "what happen!?". Now double click "there".
Press the home key. Press the down arrow to go down one line. Now, hold shift
and press down arrow again. At this point, "what happen!?" is selected to the
line below.
Pressing delete at this point will result in the deletion of "there!" as well.
The resulting text is:
hello world
hi
Including a space after "hi".
