Modify Event is sent twice in case of SWT.MULTI
in org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text.setText()
is this condition
/*
* Bug in Windows.
When the widget is multi line
* text widget, it does not send a WM_COMMAND with
* control code EN_CHANGE from SetWindowText () to
* notify the application that the text has changed.
* The fix is to send the event.

if ((style & SWT.MULTI) != 0) {
sendEvent (SWT.Modify);
// widget could be disposed at this point
}
Currently there is no such in source code described windows bug.
So ModifyEvent
is sent to listeners twice.
Tested on WindowsXP and Windows2k3.
