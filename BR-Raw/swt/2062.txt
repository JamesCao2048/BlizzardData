[browser] Different behavor of opening a PDF file when setting URL and clicking the URL
[Env]
* RedHat EL4 WS Update 4
* Eclipse 3.3 M4 build.
* Firefox 1.5.0.8
[Reproducable steps]
1.Start Eclipse.
Open  view "Internet Web Browser".
2.Use "Internet Web Broser", navigate to a web page contains a PDF link.
3.Click that PDF link, a file pick dialog pops, and then it starts downloading of you press ok.
4.While, if you input the whole PDF URL in the URL inputbox, and press "GO", it can open the PDF inside the browser view(pre-req PDF plug-in is installed).
Result:
We got different behavior when clicking a PDF link, or directly visit PDF link.
We cann't open PDF in the browser view when cliking it.
Expected:
1.They should be the same behavior.
2.It should not trigger a download if the browser can handle its content if it has PDF plug-in installed.
