Display class needs to pick better default fonts.
Right now the display class is picking fonts based on the default font used by
the button widget in libph.
However, the fonts in libph are not the best
choices since they cannot be changed without breaking existing applications.
The proposed change forces the TEXT_FONT and LIST_FONT fonts to be TextFont8
until there is a decent mechanism in place in photon for finding system wide
font configuration data.
