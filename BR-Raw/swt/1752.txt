PNG image that cannot be loaded
Build ID: N20080130-0010
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Try to load the attached PNG image file, causes invalid argument exception
2.
3.
More information:
The problem are the lines added to ImageData contructor:
if (data != null && data.length < bytesPerLine * height) {
SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT);
}
The PNFFileFormat incorrectly sets the depth field to 24 for the attached image. PNGFileFormat itself calculated 16 and reserves memory for this, but i passes 24 to ImageData because it uses another function to calculate the passed depth.
