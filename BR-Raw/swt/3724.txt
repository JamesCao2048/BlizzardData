BIDI: LTR-oriented MessageBox can't be created, if it's parent has RTL orientation.
Currently MesageBox is always created with MB_RTLREADING bit, if it's parent
has rtl orientation.
It isn't correct, because it is supposed, that MessageBox
should be created with orientation, which correspond to explicitly assigned
orientation style.
Only if orientation style isn't assigned, MessageBox should
inherit orientation from it's parent.
