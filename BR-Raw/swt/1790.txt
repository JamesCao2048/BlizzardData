Issues with transparent images when advanced graphics is on

snippet to reproduce
There seems to be an issue drawing transparent images when advanced graphics is turned on.  The problem only seems to happen when using ImageDescriptor.createImage() is used and the transparency pixel is set.
Attached is a snippet and icon to reproduce.  The issue can be reproduced with other icons as well.  If you comment out the line gc.setAdvanced(true) you will see that both icons appear.
This is a regression.  Icons were displaying fine on diagrams for us until we adopted a new Eclipse version 1 - 4 months ago.
