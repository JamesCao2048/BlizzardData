"Go to the next word (Ctrl+Right)" in text file does not work for certain cases
Build Identifier: 20110615-0604
In some cases word-by-word navigation in text files does not work properly: when pressing Ctrl+Right caret freezes at some point instead of moving forward.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Text file with a single line:
foo =
2.Place caret at the end of word "foo":
foo| =
3.Now press Ctrl+Right.
The caret is expected to move to the end of line but it remains at the same position.
Expected:
foo = |
Actual:
foo| =
