Hmm, IObjectArray has GetCount() method, maybe the fix is not to call ICustomDestinationList->AddUserTasks() and ICustomDestinationList->AppendCategory() when poa->GetCount()==0.
Enter a new problem report and lets have it fixed.
Other option is to stop throwing SWT.ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT for every call...
