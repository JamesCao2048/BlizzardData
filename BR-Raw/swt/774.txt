Hello,
I am installing the Google's Android plugin in the Eclipse IDE.
The Help
-> "Install new Software" dialog does not update the values correctly.
I have to resize the dialog or adjust the pane divider, then it updates and shows the values for the installed plugin.
Here is a link to a video that demonstrates this bug.

Notice that this happens with the latest Eclipse IDE (Galileo Eclipse 3.5) on Ubuntu Linux 9.10 (aka: Karmic Koala).
But it works right on Ubuntu 9.04 stable.
System details are:

Here is a complete installation guide for Android-development on Ubuntu Linux.
It's valid for both Ubuntu 9.04 and 9.10.
http://www.futuredesktop.org/developing_android_apps_on_ubuntu.html
Android is Google's Linux + Java-based mobile phone framework and Eclipse is its preferred IDE.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic Koala).
This is the development version of Ubuntu to be released in the end of october 2009.Afraid this bug will stay there.
2.Download and install the latest Eclipse IDE.
Do not use the Ubuntu's Eclipse package, but download "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (188 MB)" from  http://.eclipse.org .
This bug appears on both 32 and 64 bits Ubuntu 9.10.
3.Install Google's Android-plugin via the Eclipse's Help
-> "Install New Software" menu.

The location should be:  https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
Follow this guide, steps 1
- 7.

Note that this guide was written for Ubuntu 9.04, but it is equally valid for Ubuntu 9.10.AFAIK, this bug is the only difference.
