table.setToolTipText(") does not disable native tooltips
[I20071211-0010], Windows XP and Windows Vista
Steps:
1. Hit Ctrl-3 to open the Quick Access Dialog
2. Type "er"
3. Hover over one of the cut-off entries
-> Note that a native roll-over tooltip appears. My code calls table.setToolTipText(""), which should disable the native tooltips.
