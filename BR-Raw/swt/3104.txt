Can't select tool items when tool bar has a DragDetect listener
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: 200412210800
Clicking on the buttons of the perspective or fast view bar does nothing.
Instead of opening a view/perspective, it looks like it is attempting to start a
drag operation.
The click after pressing the button is ignored and if you click
and drag after pressing a button you get a "no go" cursor.
You can work around this by opening the views/perspectives using the menu.
