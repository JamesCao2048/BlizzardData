[SWT] Text.setText(..) can change font inappropriately on Mac OSX
see the attached test case to duplicate the problem.
if you run the test case with just the first .setText call, you will see the correct unicode
representation for the key sequence 'Command+X'. (Lucida Grande being the standard OS X font
for menus and such)
if you run the test case with all three .setText calls, you will notice that the 'cloverleaf' symbol is no
longer displayed correctly.
it seems that the .setText call with the empty string argument does something bad to the font.
this problem is severe for our key sequence entry widget. marking as critical for M4.
