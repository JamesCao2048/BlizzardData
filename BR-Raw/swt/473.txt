Consistently resolve XOR-mode-painting related issues on MacOSX Carbon and Cocoa
XOR-painting mode is used in various places within GEF to show feedback (drag feedback, marquee selection feedback, guide snap feedback, etc.). As this functionality is not supported on MacOSX  Carbon (GC#setXORMode() has been deprecated because of this) and as it does not seem to work "as expected" on MacOSX Cocoa (while I could not find any official information that it is not supported there), there are (and have been) quite a few bugzillas related to this. While for some of these workarounds have already been committed, there does not seem to be a consistent policy on how to deal with these issues in general.
