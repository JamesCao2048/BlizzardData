DCR - need Display.getSystemCursor()
I20030605 Red Hat 9
Eclipse - open the SWT GTK file OS.java
The method outliner takes a long time. This seems to be caused by the new
animated wait cursor used by Gnome in RH9.
OptimizeIt reports ~40% spent in Cursor.init, from BusyIndicator.showWhile
(itself from AbstractTreeViewer probably calling us for each method/variable
found in the java file.
Measures ('real', without OptimizeIt):
regular code: about 20s to 40s to open OS.java (create ~ 900 Wait Cursors)
code which reuses the Wait cursor in busyIndicator.showwhile: 4s to 7s
