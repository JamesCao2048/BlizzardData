BIDI issue in Variables view
3.0
While debugging Unicode-surrogate problems, I came across a string containing arabic characters.
The string showed up as shown in the attached screenshot.
I'm not sure whether this is a bug (and I could live with it if it were :-),
but I'm just curious whether this behavior is correct from a BIDI point of view.
