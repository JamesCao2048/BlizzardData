StyledText with SWT.WRAP cuts last character of wrapped line
I20051116-1332
- CustomControlExample, StyledText, WinXP default font (Tahoma Regular 8)
- select 50 X 50
- select SWT.WRAP
- set text to "a/Path/to/A.java" (no quotes)
-> the character "A" is cut off; should appear on second line
This is very annoying in the Details Pane of debug's Variables view.
