CCombo does not respond to keyboard or mouse actions when it it dropped down
In RC1, when you click on the drop down button for a CCombo, it doesn't respond
to any mouse or keyboard actions, other than to click it to undrop it.  If you
do this in a wizard and hit "<back", it stays showing.  Fortunately the up and
down arrows work when it's not showing the drop down, but this is very hard to
discover.  This problem will block many EMF clients from using our tools.
