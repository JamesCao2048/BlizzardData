CCombo.dropdown doesn't handle the screen's right edge
The 'popup' Shell of a CCombo is allways justified with the left side of the CCombo, regardless of the screen right edge.
I believe adding
if (x + width > displayRect.x + displayRect.width) x = displayRect.x + displayRect.width - listRect.width;
at line 382 in CCombo.java would solve it.
