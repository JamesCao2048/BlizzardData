[GTK] Classes 'browser' not initialized in 'Add Type' and 'Add Task' dialogs
Build 20030115+
Linux-GTK
The classes 'browser' (tree viewer of the folders and list viewer of the
classes) of the 'Add Type' and 'Add Task' dialogs are empty when the dialog are
displayed.
I have to select a jar file in the drop down list to display
something in the 'browser', even if the jar file I want to use is the one which
is already selected (or maybe it is not selected).
The 'browser' should be initialized with the content of the jar file selected by
default.
