cannot programmatically collapse item whose parent is collapsed
N20090315-2000
I recently saw a blank item in the Package Explorer while retrieving content from CVS.
This has been reported before but has never been reproducable.
I still cannot get a reproducable case of it, but I suspect that it's caused by the problem below.
- run the snippet below and expand the item down to its bottom descendent
- note that if you collapse-then-expand the root item that the full hierarchy is expanded (correct)
- collapse the root item, then click anywhere in the shell's open space, which does a setExpanded(false) on the first child item
- now expand the root item

-> note that the child item is still expanded, but should not be

-> on other platforms this item is correctly collapsed
I believe that the blank item I saw in the Package Explorer was a place-holder item that jface creates in order to make an expander appear beside a collapsed item whose actual child items are not yet known ( the item was not collapsed but should have been).
