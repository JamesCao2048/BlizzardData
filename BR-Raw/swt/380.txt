[GTK] Cannot enable/disable breakpoint by clicking checkbox
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of  Bug #344642  +++
Same problem on Linux GTK 3.7 M7 - works on 3.6.
1. Open a Java file and add a breakpoint
2. Switch to the Debug perspective
3. Try to disable the breakpoint by slowly clicking the checkbox
in the Breakpoints view --> not possible
Or use ControlExample steps as given in  bug 344642 comment 3 .
