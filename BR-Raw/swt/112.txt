[10.8]Font size incorrect when running in Retina
Build Identifier: 20110916-0149
Having applied the work-around to enable high-resolution display on a "Retina" mac as outlined in the comments of 382972, I noticed that the font calculation is incorrect when you have lots of tabs open and Eclipse displays a count of how many files are open but not being displayed.
See attached screenshot.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start eclipse with high-resolution enabled on a Retina Mac
2.open more files than can be displayed along the tab bar.
3.Notice that the font for the count of undisplayed tabs is exceptionally large.
