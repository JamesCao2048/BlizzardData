No focus listener control in SWT combo on Linux platform
I tried to add addFocusListener() on SWT Combo, but
it doesn't work
The following is a simple test code:
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite;
import org.eclipse.swt.events.FocusListener;
import org.eclipse.swt.events.FocusEvent;
import org.eclipse.swt.SWT;
public class TestComboFocus implements FocusListener
{
Public TestComboFocus(Composite parent)
{
Combo combo = new Combo(parent, SWT.DROP_DOWN);
combo.addFocusListener(this);
}
public void focusGained(FocusEvent e)
{
System.out.println("Combo is in focus");
}
public void focusLost(FocusEvent e)
{
System.out.println("Combo is lost focus");
}
}
These methods focusGained(), focusLost() never called when the cursor is in
or out of Combo text box.
