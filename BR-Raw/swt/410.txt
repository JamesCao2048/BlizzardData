Often can't see focus ring in Trees on Windows 7
N20101003-2000, same in 3.6 and 3.5.2
I often can't see the focus ring in Trees on Windows 7.
On WinXP, I could always see which item had the keyboard focus (dotted focus ring).
On Win7, I only see the focus item on plain SWT.MULTI trees and only if the focus is on an unselected item.
If the focus is on a selected item, it is not drawn.
In trees with an SWT.EraseItem listener, the focus is never drawn.
