[CTabFolder] Widget Disposed SWTException when closing Application with opened Tab-Chooser
Hi,
take this snippet:
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
CTabFolder folder = new CTabFolder(shell, SWT.CLOSE);
for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
CTabItem item = new CTabItem(folder, SWT.NONE);
item.setText("Item " + i);
Text text = new Text(folder, SWT.BORDER | SWT.MULTI);
text.setText("Content for Item " + i);
item.setControl(text);
}
shell.setSize(400, 400);
shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch())
display.sleep();
}
display.dispose();
}
}
Click on the button top-right to popup the small list with Tabs that are
currently not visible. Leave the popup open and close the application. A
SWTException is thrown. I am able to reproduce this with latest SWT 3106
and with earlier 3062.
Somehow SWT.MouseUp Event is fired when closing the application with opened
Popup. The call to getDisplay() then results in the Exception, since Display
is disposed in that situation.

Ben
