[Browser] Linux: SSL navigation is disabled when Mozilla profile directory does not exist
Build ID: Eclipse 3.3
Steps To Reproduce:
Env: Suse Linux ED10
Eclipse: 3.3
SSL website ( https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs ) can't visit if Mozilla profile directory doesn't exist(~/.mozilla/eclipse)
Steps to reproduce
1.Goto Mozilla profile root directory, rm "eclipse"(or rename) directory if it has.
This is to make a clean environment
2.Open Eclipse, show "Internal web browser" from menu Windows
->Show View->Others, "General" catalog.
3.Visit " https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs ".
4.Get two error dialogs, and then SSL is disabled.
In another way, if you visit a normal HTTP WebSite( http://www.eclipse.org ) at first, then navigate to SSL website, it is ok.
The reason is when Mozilla visits SSL site, it persists credentail information at two files(cert8.db & key3.db), but if the Eclipse specified profile directory doesn't exist, it will fail.
If we visit HTTP first, Mozilla will try to create "Eclipse" directory, and put "/cache" "history.dat" files on that.
So when user visits SSL website firstly on a clean environment, this problem happens.
More information:
A proposed fix would be update AppFileLocProvider.java file on org.eclipse.swt.browser package, when Mozilla.java calls setProfilePath() method, it should check if it exists, and create it if it doesn't.
This can fix the problem, and doesn't impact other functions.
void setProfilePath (String path) {
profilePath = path;
if(profilePath!=null){
File profileF=new File(profilePath);
if(profileF.exists()==false){
try{
profileF.mkdir();
}catch(Exception e){
//log some error here.
}
}
}
}
