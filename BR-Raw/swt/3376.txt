Hitting Enter when a combobox is open can invoke default button
For example, I go to the Preferences dialog and go to the Keys section.
Using
the mouse, I click on the Category combobox, but I see that there are a lot of
them, so I use the keyboard to navigate up and down the list.
When the correct
item is highlighted I hit Enter to select that item in the combobox, but
instead, the dialog gets dismissed.
In other Windows apps, the combobox will
close but the dialog will remain open.
