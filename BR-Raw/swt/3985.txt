Coolbar - platform wrapping should not change item sizes
Build 200207161002
1.Run the attached test case.
2.Size the window slightly smaller horizontally so that the Open Type (last
cool item) gets wrapped to the next row.
Notice that the first cool item on the first row is resized bigger.
Also
notice how flashy the auto wrapping is as you size the window smaller.
You can
actually see the items being moved to the left than back to the right.
