StyledText - during cut if clipboard copy fails do not delete text
StyledText.cut() calls copy() which does a clipboard copy and can fail.
If the
copy fails, the cut operation should NOT delete the text.
One can currently
lose work.
Resolve later.
Why copy is failing so often in some cases [ Bug 16011 ] is a
separate issue.
