Warnings suppressed from GtkFileChooser creation
Currently, warnings are suppressed when creating a GtkFileChooser widget. This is to avoid warning spews when the hicolor theme is not installed.
This practice is harmful for two reasons:
1. The warnings from GTK+ are intentional, hicolor is a dependency of GTK+,
and if it is not installed then the file chooser is missing the icons for
its bookmarks.  The icons are part of hicolor so they can be themed.
2. If real warnings are issued during creation, we don't see them.  This
seems definitely possible in some cases, see  bug 101790 .
