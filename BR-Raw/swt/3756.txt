RedHat 8.0 - DefaultInformationControl hangs workbench
Using DefaultInformationControl to provide tooltips for table items. Works
flawlessly in windows and almost flawlessly in GTK.
Almost in that they work great in Views and in my editor. However, I have a
Dialog that includes a Table. The tooltip for an item in that table appears,
but then its like the tooltip has grabbed focus and will not let go.
Once the tip is visible, there's no way to get rid of it and I have to kill
the Eclipse process.
See soon to be attached file for how I'm using DefaultInformationControl and
AbstractHoverInformationControlManager to achieve this.
