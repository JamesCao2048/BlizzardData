Build Identifier:  I20100520-1744
If you open a xmxl file, select some lines , press <CTRL>+P and select "Selected Text" at the printer dialog, the hole xml file will be printed.
This is especially annoying if you print at a network printer (in separate room) and the xml file has a size of about 2MB.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a xml file
2. select several lines
3. goto print and select "Selection"
