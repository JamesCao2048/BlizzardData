CVSUIPlugin.stop not being called
Build ID: I20070608-1718
Steps To Reproduce:

2. set breakpoint in CVSUIPlugin.stop
3. start/stop pde debugging session, CVSUIPlugin.stop is never called (debugger never hits breakpoint)
More information:
i was attempting to work on a patch for  bug 167980 , so i went into the 'org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui' dir under '.metadata/.plugins' to clear it out for some testing, and  upon restarting eclipse and entering a test commit message and then shutting down, i find the contents of the directory empty.
if i hook the debugger up to the cvs-ui source, and set a breakpoint in CVSUIPlugin.stop, the debugger does not break upon shutdown.
i've experienced this on a brand new install the latest release candidate.
