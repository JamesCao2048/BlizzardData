Random crashes attributable to Safari
Whenever I use the internal browser I often end up getting crashes at random moments.
Most of the time these crashes occur after I have stopped using the browser and I've closed it, so I suspect there's some cleanup that's not happening properly.
The stack traces are always similiar,  WebDocumentLoaderMac::setDataSource is always the final native call in these crashes.
I'm attaching a stack trace below...
