FormData throws "Widget is disposed" when it's widget is dispose()d
FormData.getXXXAttachment() throws SWTException "Widget is disposed" because it
doesn't do any isDisposed() checks.
I originally thought hiding the component first and forcing a layout(true) would
fix it, but that must have been some other problem.
I am attaching a snippit.
