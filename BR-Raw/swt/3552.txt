Deleting the first column of a Table may throw an exception
If a table is created which has images associated with items in the first
column, but not in the second, deleting the first column throws an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
The exception produced was:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
-1
at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.ImageList.get(ImageList.java:176)
at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Table.destroyItem(Table.java:523)

(TableColumn.java:305)

Exception in thread "main"
In the org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Table class, if the first column is being
destroyed and other columns exists, the second column is shifted to the first
and then destroyed.
During this shifting, an assumption is made that if the
Table has an imagelist, then the image indices (from the LVITEM structures) of
the second column are valid indices into the imagelist.
The second column's
indices are not valid, however, because the second column's items do not have
images.
The code in question is in Table.java, lines 522-523 (for 3.0, 529-530).
