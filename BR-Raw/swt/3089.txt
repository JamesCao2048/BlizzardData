Setting style bits breaks SWT embedded Swing in Milestone M4
Creating an SWT container with
Composite container = new Composite(shell, SWT.BORDER|SWT.EMBEDDED);
for embedding swing no longer works under Linux for milestone 4.The embedded
swing components aren't drawn when the SWT container appears.
However it works if you create the container with
Composite container = new Composite(shell, SWT.EMBEDDED);
