Toolitem calling gtk_widget_add_events after it is realized
Before a GTK+ widget is realized, calling gtk_widget_add_events simply sets some
private data and does not do any work in the X server.
However, if the widget
is already realized, changing the event mask requires querying the current mask
from the X server and updating its state in X.
In SWT, hookEvents() is always performed on unrealized widgets, except in
ToolItem.
ToolItem is being realized because it is asking for the foreground
colour of its parent, which causes it to be realized.
The fix is to either
avoid realizing the parent (it is not required in this particular case), and
maybe to defer connecting the tool item to its parent until later.
