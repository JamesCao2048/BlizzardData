[browser] xulrunner 1.9-based Browser has no initial background
- happens on win2000, doesn't happen on linux, haven't tried osx
- run snippet 128 with the setUrl() line at the bottom commented out
- the browser has no background drawn for it until a url or text is set
- the only known way to fix this so far is to set the initial page to about:blank and don't send any resulting events
