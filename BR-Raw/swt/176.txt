[GK3][Cairo] Images created with external image handle (GdkPixmap* or cairo_surface_t*) can't be drawn using GC.drawImage()
In WindowBuilder project I have to create an Image instance using external GdkPixmap* value.
I used Image.gtk_new() method to create such Image. Then I need to draw this image on some GC. This works fine with Cairo disabled. When Cairo is enabled, the image is not drawn.
The workaround is to invoke Image.getImageData() method. After this invocation it works fine.
Sample code:
Image image = Image.gtk_new(null, SWT.BITMAP, pixmapHandle, 0);

Image mainImage = new Image(null, 240, 160);
GC gc = new GC(mainImage);
// image.getImageData(); // uncomment to get it working
gc.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
gc.dispose();
// save mainImage using ImageLoader
