[browser] Mozilla browser instances held in memory forever due to dispose listener on display
Build Identifier: M20090917-0800
After you create an org.eclipse.swt.browser.Mozilla it will never be garbage collected since it adds a dispose listener to the Display and never removes it. The listener is added as shown below...
1186: display.addListener (SWT.Dispose, new Listener () {
...etc
This seems like an obvious memory leak and caused me some confusion whilst debugging.
AFAICT the org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE browser doesn't hang around like this.
Reproducible: Always
