SWTException stacktrace misleading when in Display.syncExec
Build ID: M20060921-0945
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Run something outside the UI thread.
2. Issue a Display.syncExec(Runnable)
3. Throw an SWTException
The resulting stack trace contains no information from where the Display.syncExec has been issued. This makes bug tracking quite difficult for a supporter.
More information:
Change Display.syncExec such that the original SWTException is caught in the issuer thread. Issue a new SWTException with the previous one as cause. As result the reported Exception contains sufficient information.
