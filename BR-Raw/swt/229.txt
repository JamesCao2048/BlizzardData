[CCombo] Very long text in CCombo causes vertical scroll bar to disappear
If there are very long text in the CCombo, the vertical scrollbar of dropdown
listbox disappears beyond the edge of the screen. I have seen defects 37329 and
7946, but this is different, as it is not related to Properties view.
