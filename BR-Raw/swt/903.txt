SWT: crash when calling setParent() on Linux
Created  attachment 138197   [details]
examples for both GLCanvas and TableViewer that crash on Linux 3.5M1 and later
Build ID: I20090528-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a Shell
2. Add a GLCanvas
3. open the Shell
4. Create a second Shell
5. call glCanvas.setParent(secondShell)
6. open the second Shell
More information:
There appears to be a general problem with calling setParent() to add widgets to a Shell that is not yet open. It is useful to add the widgets to the new shell before opening so that the new shell can be opened with the correct size.
We have encountered this bug in our RCP in two seemly unrelated scenarios: (a) moving a GLCanvas to a new Shell; and (b) moving a TableViewer to a new Shell. In both cases, SWT crashes.
Examples test cases are attached for both scenarios. In the GLCanvas case, the test application immediately crashes. In the TableViewer case, the TextCellEditor Text widgets appears in a tiny new window rather than inside the table. If you try to close the new window, the application crashes.
The problem seems to be related to a missing native pointer to the GTK window. In both cases, calls to OS.GTK_WIDGET_WINDOW(widget) return 0 at some point. In the GLCanvas example, the application crashes when then 0 window pointer is passed to OS.gdk_x11_drawable_get_xdisplay (window) at GLCanvas.java line 257.
In the TableViewer case, Eclipse prints out:
(SWT:28745): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_window_new: assertion `window != NULL' failed
The bug appears all the way back to Eclipse 3.5M1 and up through 3.5RC3. Ecplise 3.4.2 does not exhibit the bug. The bug does not appear on Windows.
Breaks on:
Ubuntu 9.04 and Centos 4
Eclipse 3.5M1 through 3.5RC3
Works on:
Windows
Eclipse 3.4.2 and earlier
