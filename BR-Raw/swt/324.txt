certain images cause "no more handles" on win7
Build Identifier: 20110615-0604
When searching for a certain plugin using the marketplace client the query takes quite a lot of time and then crashes with an Unhandled event loop exception: SWTError: No more handles.
I can reproduce this with a clean JavaEE-Package install, everytime I switch to the Yoxos marketplace and do search for "Target Management" it crashes this way. Searching for other things is fine, searching for Target Management in the Eclipse marketplace, too.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Marketplace Client
2. Switch to Yoxos marketplace
3. Type "Target Management" in the find box and press enter
