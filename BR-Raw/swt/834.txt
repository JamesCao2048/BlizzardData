Measure event always comes before an Erase/Paint event on Mac and Windows, but not on GTK
Run the attached snippet on GTK and observe how the items don't look right after moving over them with the mouse, or after scrolling.
They are supposed to look like:
000
111
222
333
etc.
The snippet works on Windows and the Mac. It caches a TextLayout object in MeasureItem and uses it in PaintItem.
