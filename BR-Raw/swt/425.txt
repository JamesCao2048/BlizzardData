Rename Display.getAppMenuBar() to getMenuBar().
It is clear that Display.getMenuBar() returns the application menu bar.
No need to have "App" in the API name.
It is also more consistent with current Shell.getMenuBar() API.
We are also adding Display.getSystemMenu() which returns the system-provide menu for the application.
Only available on cocoa at the moment (menu with about, preferences, etc).
See  bug#329456 .
We initially thought this API would be called getAppMenu(), but we decided to keep it consistent with all Display.getSystem* APIs (color, font, image, cursor, etc).
So the new concept "App" is not needed anymore.
We plan to add Shell.getSystemMenu() which returns the system-provide menu for shells (GTK/Windows).
