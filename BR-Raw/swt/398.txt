KEY CTRL+O is passed to IE8
Build Identifier: M20090211-1700
When a browser widget has the focus (with IE8 on the machine), the key CTRL+O  is passe to it.
This does not occur with IE6!
As we use a key binding von CTRL+O to open an own dialog, now the standard open dialog from IE8 also opens.
How can we suppress passing CTRL+O to IE8?
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a view with a browser widget (IE8 on the machine)
2.Press CTRL+O
3.The standard open dialog opens (which does not with IE6)
