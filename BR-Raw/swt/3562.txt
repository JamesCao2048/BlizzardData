TableItem.getImage periodically throws ArrayOutOfBoundsException
In the final call to imageList.get (imageIndex), sometimes imageIndex == -1.
This causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception in the call to imageList.get.
This is happening because the index of ptr [0] is not in the table. Would it be
possible to put in a check for this? It causes a bunch of other downstream errors.
