[browser] Intro view loses content on perspective switch
3.1M7
- start a brand new eclipse
-> the purple Intro screen comes up first
- double-click its "Welcome" tab so that it reduces to a view on the right side
of the workbench
- switch to the Java perspective

-> the Welcome view is there as well (I'm guessing this is by design?)

-> but more importantly, it's blank
- if you switch back to the Resource perspective the browser is blank there too
- the Browser will not gets its contents back by typical resizing, but it will
if the view is maximized
