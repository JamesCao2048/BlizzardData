Need API to check advanced graphics mode
Most operating systems offer a different library to do advanced graphics (Mac
does not).  The advanced graphics support in SWT makes use of this library to
implement features such as antialiasing, tranformations, alpha etc.  When one
of these features is requested, SWT graphics begins to use the advanced
library for all graphics operations, even those that are not advanced.  Since
two different operating system graphics libraries are in use, there may be
differences in output (such as string measuring) and performance.
We would like to add GC.getAdvanced() and GC.setAdvanced(boolean) to allow
appliations to have control over advanced mode.
