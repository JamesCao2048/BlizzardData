Can Widget.getDisplay() be called from a background thread?
3.1 M5
Widget.getDisplay()'s Javadoc has:
<li>ERROR_THREAD_INVALID_ACCESS
- if not called from the thread that created the
receiver</li>
But the implementation, at least on Windows, does not check the thread.
It seems like this should work from any thread, otherwise it would really
complicate the common code pattern:
control.getDisplay().asyncExec(...)
Can this be used from any thread, or not?
