Build ID: I20090313-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Run the attached snippet. The shell has a child window created with ON_TOP bit set.
2. Click on button "press". Another child window of the same parent is created but it doesn't have the ON_TOP bit set. But this new child window is above the ON_TOP child window.

The same snippet works fine on carbon and windows and also in cocoa for a shell with no parent.
Behavior can also be reproduced using the Shell tab in the control example. Create shell with parent radio button selected.
