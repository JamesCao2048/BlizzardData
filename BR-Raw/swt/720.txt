Table - EraseItem listener produces cheese when scrolling
To reproduce:
1. Launch attached snippet
2. Scroll horizontally to the right as much as possible
3. Scroll horizontally to the left (very slowly)
The selected line has cheese coming in from the left (see screenshot). I observed this on Vista SP2, Eclipse Build Id I20100129-1300.
What I found interesting is that this only happens when an SWT.EraseItem listener is attached to the table. However the listener itself does nothing (empty).
