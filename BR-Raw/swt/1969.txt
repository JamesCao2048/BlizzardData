Drawing Problems
The drawProc in the Control make use of PtGetsAbsPosition.  This is not a good
funtion to use in a drawing procedure because it queries every region in the
system until it hits the root region to figure out your position.  Doing this
every draw operation is extremely expensive.  I have updated the function as
well as fixed some little drawing issues within SWT.
