StyledText - showSelection when selection RtoL problem
Build I20021008
If I have a selection where the cursor is on the left side then showSelection
does not work with long lines.
Test Case:
1. Open an editor
2. Add lots of characters (so that you need to scroll horizontally)
3. Go to the end of the line (End)
4. Press Shift+Home
