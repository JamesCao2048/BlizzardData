Shift+F10 has wrong keyCode
F3
A snippet is included below that simply listens for key presses and prints the
respective keyCode and state for each.
When it's run on any platform other
than hpux its values for Shift+F10 are:
Key Pressed: 16777235. State: 131072
However on hpux pressing Shift+F10 gives:
Key Pressed: 0. State: 131072
This causes an accessibility problem in Eclipse because Shift+F10 is used to
display the context menu for the currently selected item.
It might be another problem case in Widget.setKeyState().
