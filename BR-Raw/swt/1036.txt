Second call to fillRectangle/fillOval uses black background instead of the declared one

Modified version of Snippet34 to show the problem
This seems to be a problem only with "swt-3.5M6-cocoa-macosx-x86_64".
I cannot reproduce this in the carbon version of 3.5M6 or the windows version of 3.5M6.I have not tried the 32bit version of cocoa.
Steps:
1.Set the background and foreground colors for GC.
2.Call fillRectangle/fillOval and it looks fine.
3.Call fillRectangle/fillOval a second time to draw an adjacent object without calling GC.setBackground or GC.setForeground.
4.The second object is filled with black instead of using the previously set background color.
Please see attached file which is a modification of snippet34.
