Problem with Umlauts in Photon
We've got problems wuth Umlauts in our UI. The cause for
that is, that for the AWT/SWT character conversion the
Class org.eclipse.swt.internal.Converter is used which
uses the converters of the String class. The converter
in the String class is the standard converter which is set
with 'file-converter=utf8'. This is showing all Umlauts
correctly in the UI but all I/O interfaces are using
this conversion as well. Since these are external code
we're not able to change them and set encoding back to
Latin1.

The question is:
The Photon port of the AWT/SWT must use UTF8 for displaying
Text in Photon. Why is the converter that is dependant
on the 'file-converter' parameter? The OTI implementation
is marked as 'SLOW AND BOGUS' when will that be changed?
