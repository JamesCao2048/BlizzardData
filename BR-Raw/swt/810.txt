3.5, same in 3.4.2 and I20090929-0800
I was too brave and tried to reproduce  bug 291483  in a Javadoc hover.
This
eventually crashed my VM.
Steps:
- open a Java editor
- show a Javadoc hover
- click into the popup to give it focus
- press Ctrl+L
=> Hover popup disappears.
Everything looks well, but the StyledText in the
editor does not consume mouse clicks any more (but e.g.
arrow keys still work).
- press Ctrl+W
=> VM crash.
