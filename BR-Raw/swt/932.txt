[DND] COM leak during drag and drop

Snippet to recreate leak
Build ID: I20090528-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
This problem is causing out of memory errors in a large RCP application. I was able to recreate the defect using Snippet91.
1. Run the attached snippet91.
2. Drag and drop a child element
3. Press the "Recreate tree" button. When the button is pressed the tree will be disposed and the COMObject.ObjectMap will be printed.
4. Repeat steps 2 - 3 to see the leak.
More information:
I expect that the COMObject.ObjectMap would be cleaned up when the tree is disposed but it isn't when a previous drag and drop has occurred.
This causes DragSource$4 objects to leak, and in the real application, these anonymous inner classes reference much larger objects which eventually cause OutOfMemoryErrors.
