SWT OSX 3.2M does not display labels on raw background
I use a raw main shell that I hand position items on for my main pgm screen.
(Visual therapists program and I need that level of control rather than
use a layout manager.)  Pgm creates very large 'Labels' of constrasting
color and uses them as 'bars' where needed to pull a stroke victim's
eyes in the direction they would otherwise tend not to see (e.g.
bar/Label
full height of screen and an inch wide not uncommon).
This used to work
on OSX and has always worked Win/Linux-gtk.
It no longer works
in 3.2M3 on OSX (just downloaded and tested) though same code works
Win/Lin-gtk works fine Win/Lin-gtk w/ 3.2M3. Problem behavior is
the Label "Bar" does not show at all ...
I just see the background
color of the main window.
Providing the code snippet used to place a vertical bar on the left edge of the
screen.
If someone wants to email me I'll provide more code.

Label barLeft = new Label(shell, SWT.NONE);
barVerticalSize = new Point(barVerticalWidthPixels,
shellSize.y
- buttonSize.y
- buttonBorder.y
- 5);
barLeft.setLocation(new Point(0, 0));
barLeft.setSize(barVerticalSize);
barLeft.setBackground(settings.barBackground);
