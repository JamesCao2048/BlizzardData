Add Resource.getDevice()
It would be really useful to if Resource had a getDevice() method.
The JFace ImageDescriptors could use this when creating a descriptor from an
existing resource.
The descriptor is capable of reusing the existing image when
asked for another image on the same device, but it frequently needs to create
copies of the image in the (common) situations where the device is unknown.
A getDevice() method would allow us to reduce the number of images created when
a new image is created on the same device.
