[typing] Copy/paste doesn't work occasionally
Hi.
When I do the copying/pasting, something seems strange:
I'm editing the Java source code, and want to copy some lines of code to
another place, I selected the lines, about 15-line, press Ctrl-C, and then
move to the paste place, and press Ctrl-V, and just nothing happened.
I've
tried several time, and tried to use mouse and right-button-menu for the
copy/paste, the results are the same.
And I also tried to copy/paste only one
line, it
sometimes works, but not always.
With multiple lines copy/paste, it sometimes
works too.
I'm using the Eclipse 3, Windows 2000 pro, JDK 1.4.2, Lomboz.3rc2(before),
Lomboz 3(now).
