event firing differences (win32/motif)
RC1
This is marked as a linux-motif problem since win32 is generally "right".
I
noticed these differences by watching the events console in the ControlExample
while running on different platforms.
Drop down a Combo:
- motif does not fire a MouseUp after the triggering MouseDown
- win32 does
Select a combo item that is already selected (ie.- the previous selection)
- motif fires Selection
- win32 fires Modify + Selection.
The following all seem like the same thing (Selection events are fired early by
the emulated Table and Tree);
Select a Table item
- motif fires Selection + MouseDown + MouseUp
- win32 fires MouseDown + Selection + MouseUp
Select a TreeItem
- motif fires Selection + MouseDown + MouseUp
- win32 fires MouseDown + Selection + MouseUp
Expand a TreeItem
- motif fires Selection + MouseDown + MouseUp
- win32 fires MouseDown + Selection + MouseUp
Collapse a TreeItem
- motif fires Selection + Collapse + MouseDown
- win32 fires Collapse + MouseDown + Selection
