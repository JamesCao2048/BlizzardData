Accelerators stop working when menu items have been disabled/reenabled
Created  attachment 229602   [details]
Sample application to reproduce the problem
- configure your Windows machine (I'm using Win 7 Pro) to support different keyboard layouts (I'm using DE and RU)
- launch the Test.java sample application
- press Ctrl+A
=> the current time is printed
- switch to RU keyboard layout
- press Ctrl+A
=> the current time is printed
- use the cursor keys to move the caret around
=> the menu item is disabled
- now move the caret at the last line's end position using the cursor keys
=> the menu item is enabled again
- press Ctrl+A => it won't print the time any more
