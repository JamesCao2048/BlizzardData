[Bidi] Text#addSegmentListener(..) should not require client to call setText(..)
Text#addSegmentListener(..) should not require the client to call setText(..). This is confusing and it's also not necessary in the equivalent API on StyledText.
Furthermore, setText(..) is not the only way to trigger the segment listener. If the programmer didn't account for this bug, then the segment listener may also be called for the first time as a response to user input that goes into the Text widget.
