[Mac] Right clicking on app in Dock and selecting Quit does nothing if file needs to be saved
With Eclipse 3.2 on the Mac OSX,
Steps:
1.Launch Eclipse
2.Open some source code for editing.
3.Make an edit, but dont save it.
4.Minimize the application to the Dock.
5.Right click on the application in the Dock and choose Quit
Note: For us, the problem was reported with our RCP application that we generated through Eclipse.
However, I made the repro steps similar just with the Eclipse IDE itself.
Actual:
Nothing happens, if you right click again you will notice a "save Resource" item
in the menu.
You can continue to click on quit
Expexcted:
It should behave like other Mac OSX applications.
Their icons do the 'bouncy icon' thing to alert the user that theres a problem that needs attention.
The user then left clicks on it in the dock to open the app and see the "Save Resources" dialog.
