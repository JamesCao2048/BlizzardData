Browser should specify encoding of LocationEvent#location and align implementations
I20100309-0100 Cocoa
Links to other types in Javadoc hovers don't work any more on Cocoa.
That's because I get a URISyntaxException in:
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.viewsupport.JavaElementLinks$1.changing(JavaElementLinks.java:199)
On other platforms (IE on WinXP, Mozilla on GTK), the URI in LocationEvent#location is URI-encoded, but on Cocoa/Safari, the location is coming in its raw (unencoded) form.
LocationEvent#location should specify that the string is an encoded URI.
If you don't have the encoded form of the URI, you can encode the raw location like this:
new URI(null, null, rawLocation).toASCIIString()
