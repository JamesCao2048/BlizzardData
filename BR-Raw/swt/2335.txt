Menu class has a public '_setVisible(boolean)' method.
On 3.2.0, I noticed that there is a public _setVisible(boolean) method in the org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Menu class for linux gtk. My examination of 3.1.2's source code indicates that the problem was present back then as well. I took a look at win32 and carbon's implementation and both of them have this method marked with package visibility instead of public.
Perhaps it really is supposed to be public for the gtk due to implementation reasons? I don't really know, but if that's the case, there should be some javadoc documentation indicating what it's for and whether developers should call it, because right now there is no javadoc for it right now.
