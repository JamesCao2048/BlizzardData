StyledText - text change even mechanism poorly documented
build 20020430
The TextChangeListener doc is incomplete and misleading.
The class doc says that "It is not intended for use by users of the StyledText
widget or implementors of StyledTextContent". This is misleading because
implementors of StyledTextContent need to invoke the apropriate listener
method. So they need to use the TextChangeListener. Should change to ...should
not be implemented by users of StyledText... etc.
The textChanged and textSet methods are not documented at all.
The doc for StyledTextContent.addTextChangeListener, replaceTextRange and
setText is incomplete. The last two methods should mention which methods the
text events should be sent to. This should be pretty obvious when looking at
the TextChangeListener but we may just want to mention it explicitly.
