TrayItem obscures KDE's gradient
If you have an image with a transparency mask in a TrayItem, the background
around the image is composited onto gray (the default GTK+ widget background
colour).
KDE uses a gradient as the background of their panel by default.
This
causes the SWT TrayItem to stand out, as it appears in a gray box rather than
honour KDE's gradient.
One possible fix is to use the X SHAPE extension and define a shape mask for the
window.
