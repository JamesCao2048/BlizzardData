StyledText - RTF transfer codepage encoding
build 20020716
The SWT RTFTransfer class currently uses the system default codepage to encode
Unicode text in a multibyte character set.
This breaks RTF transfer if the system codepage is not set correctly (data is
lost during conversion).
Text in more than one local codepage (e.g., mixed Japanese and Hebrew) can
never be transfered correctly because RTFTransfer converts to a single local
codepage. Data represented in a different codepage would be lost.
In addition, the RTF spec mandates escaping non 7-bit characters using 'hh
where hh is the hex value. Even if the codepage is set correctly and the text
is in a single locale it should still be written in the espaced form. Note
however that all Windows applications we tested seemed to tolerate the non
escaped 8 bit form for transfering Hebrew text.
In order to support text in more than one locale we would need to encode the
text using RTF unicode escapes (ud..d where d is the decimal value of the
unicode character). Since some applications don't support the Unicode encoded
RTF transfer (e.g., Lotus Notes) we need to use the mixed Unicode/ANSI text
encoding which is backward compatible for non Unicode aware applications.
Open questions:
-performance impact of escaping 8-bit characters
-do any non Microsoft applications support pasting the Unicode encoded RTF
-performance impact of encoding using Unicode escapes mixed in with the ANSI
escapes
