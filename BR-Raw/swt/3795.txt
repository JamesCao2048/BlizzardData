Resistering TraverseListenter with Shell changes tabbing behavior.
2.1 RC1 motif build.
org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.ContextHelpDialog registers TraverseLisenter with
Shell.
It changes behavior of "Tab" key.
Without registerning, the key can be
used to move focus around widgets on the control, when TraverseListener is
registered, using "Tab" moves focus until it reaches the shell and does not
move to the next widget.
