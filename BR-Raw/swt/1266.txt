GC#setTransform() loses antialias setting
try this in cocoa
gc.setAntialias(SWT.OFF);
Transform t = new Transform(e.display);
gc.setTransform(t);
gc.drawOval(1, 10, 20, 20);
// this oval will be antialias
If I setAntialias(SWT.OFF) after calling setTransform(t) it all works fine.
SSQ said to check setClipping can have the same problem. And maybe it loses alpha too.
