Cannot draw transparent PNG files properly
I have a problem with the following code.
The problem is that the image drawn on my canvas is collapsed if the imageData
is created from a PNG file with transparency. It seems that RGBs are drawn well
but an alpha channel has shifted to the right. There is no problem with
transparent GIFs or non-transparent PNGs.
It happens on Linux.
------ code ------
void drawHalf(GC gc, ImageData imageData, int destx, int desty) {
Image image = new Image(null, imageData);
gc.setClipping(destx + imageData.width/2, desty,
imageData.width/2, imageData.height);
gc.drawImage(image, destx, desty);
image.dispose();
}
