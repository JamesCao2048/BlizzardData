Custom selection does not redraw when resizing window
This bug can be seen by running Snippet229 and resizing the window using the right side of the shell.
Resize in and out and the gradient for the custom selection will disappear in some places.
- It works WITHOUT the manifest but does not work WITH manifest.
- Tested in motif, Mac and gtk and they seem to not have that problem.
