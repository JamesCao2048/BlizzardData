CTabFolder.setBackground(Image) should be deleted
It looks like CTabFolder.setBackground(Image) was being considered for API in the Eclipse 3.0 time frame (at present, it is still private).
Since that time, Control.setBackgroundImage(Image) was added in Eclipse 3.2, so CTabFolder.setBackground(Image) and bgImage should probably just be deleted because they are obsolete.
Currently, the code looks to see if bgImage is null (of course, it will always be null because nobody can set it). Should we use Control.getBackgroundImage() instead?
Steve, do you have the history on CTabFolder.setBackground(Image), and why it never became API?
