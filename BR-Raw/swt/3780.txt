Widget "default" styles should be reflected in style bits
RC2
There are various cases, easily shown in the ControlExample, of widgets taking
on a "default" style even though an explicit style bit is not provided.  For
example, a Label of type SWT.SEPARATOR defaults to be vertical unless
SWT.HORIZONTAL is explicitly specified.  This is fine, but consequently
invoking Label.getStyle() answers a style that does not contain the
SWT.VERTICAL bit since it was not explicitly specified at creation time.
The checkStyle() methods on a few widgets need to be extended to ensure
that "default" styles get added in to specified styles whenever "default"
styles are to be used.
