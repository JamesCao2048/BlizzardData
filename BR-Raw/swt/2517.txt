1. File > new > Other...> Plug-in Development > Target Definition
2. In the wizard, enter any name.  Accept Defaults.  Finish.  The file will open in a form-based editor.
3. Go to the second page of the editor.  Observe how the Environment section are not properly aligned.
Note that if I run the exact same PDE code against SWT v3221 restores good layout.  so something must have happened to GridLayout/GridData recently to break it.
