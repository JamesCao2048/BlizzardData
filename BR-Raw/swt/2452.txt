Browser causes blank white box on OSX
In an SWT app that embeds a Browser widget within a CTabFolder in a ViewForm which is at the bottom of a StackLayout  (other composites sit atop it, with tables and such), the Browser causes a large blank white box on top of the app.
When the browser is disabled, the white box does not appear on top of the app.
Since I don't have a mac I can't produce the problem, but every mac user reports this problem with the SWT app (which doesn't have this problem on gtk or win32), so I'm hoping this can be easily replicated somehow on osx (with a Browser created in a StackLayout with other things on top of it I presume).
SWT 3.2M4 is in use.
