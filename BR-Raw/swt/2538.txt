Macintel: Password text fields don't show echo character
3.1 on Macintel:
Password fields don't show echo characters.
It seems that the UniChar passed to OS.TXNEchoMode is interpreted as a 2-byte string!
On big endian systems (PPC) the default value of '245' results in the string '245' '0' which works fine.
On small endian systems (Intel) the default value results in the string '0' '245'
Since the first character '0' is treated as a string terminator, no echo character is shown.
The following experiment proves this: if I use this declaration:
static final char PASSWORD = ('a'
<< 8) + 'b';
then the first echo character will be 'b' and the second 'a'
The workaround for this problem is the following declaration:
static final char PASSWORD = ('245'
<< 8) + '245';
