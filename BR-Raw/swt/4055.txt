Combo control in view toolbar does not refresh view properly
Eclipse build: F1, F2 and F3
Platform: Windows 2000 (professional)
If an SWT Combo widget is added as a contribution to a view's toolbar, updating
the associated toolbar manager leaves an unpainted background region displayed
in the view. This region happens to correspond to the size of the Combo drop-
down list. It appears that the view's content control is not being refreshed.
This problem did not occur in the M5 (or any earlier) drop but is present in
builds F1, F2 and F3.
I tracked down the Windows messages being sent to the control when the toolbar
manager is updated. The logic in ViewForm.layout(boolean) attempts to calculate
the size of the container (center toolbar) and then calls setBounds() on the
toolbar to update its position and size. Eventually, OS.SetWindowPos() is
called for the combo control and the following messages were received by
Display.widowProc():
WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING
WM_NCCALCSIZE
WM_NCPAINT
WM_ERASEBKGND
WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED
WM_SIZE
WM_PAINT
I will attach a ZIP file with a simple plugin that demonstrates the problem.
The steps required to show the problem are:
1. Window->Show View->Other éˆ¥
2. In the "Other" category, select the view "Test Combo View" and open it.
3. Move the view to the right side of the workbench window (beside the tasks
view) and alternate activating the Tasks view and the combo view.
4. The values in the combobox are used to determine how often the combo is
actually visible. Thus, setting the value to every third time means that the
view can be activated twice without having the combo visible but on the third
activation, the combo appears.
Ensure the view is wide enough so that the combo will be located between the
label and the close button, otherwise, when it appears, it will resize the view
contents and cause a repaint of those contents to occur.
