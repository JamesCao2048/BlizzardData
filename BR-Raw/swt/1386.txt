Accessible.getDescription should not return name
- Load SWT Cocoa and the SWT examples from HEAD.
- Run org.eclipse.swt.examples.accessibility.AccessibleShapesExample
- turn on VoiceOver
- type the TAB key to give focus to the various shapes
Note that the shapes report their name twice.
In Accessible.getDescription(), if there isn't any description, then we should just return, instead of asking the application for a name.
