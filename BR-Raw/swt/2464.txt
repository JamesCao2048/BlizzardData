SWT_AWT frames in task bar
On switching between windows there are SWT panels disposed with embedded
AWT (with SWT_AWT.newFrame).
On this actions I got empty windows appearing
in taskbar (windows).
It could be acceptable for 1  but when I see appearing
5 in a time and disappearing, it doesn't look nice.
Perhaps, instead of the "invokeLater" on disposing frame, should be used some kind of "invokeAndWait"
