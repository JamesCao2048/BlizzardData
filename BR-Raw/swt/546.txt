False presentation of a control contributed through the org.eclipse.ui.menu extension point
Build Identifier: 20100617-1415
Hello Eclipse-Team,
I have found the following bug. By using the implemented extension point named org.eclipse.ui.menus I have added a custom control. The visual presentation of this control in my toolbar under windows vista as well as ubuntu 10.04 is fine (see screenshots). Under MAC OS X 10.6 the visual presentation seems not to be correct. Obviously there is a mismatch with the position of the control.
For better understanding I have added 3 screenshots and an example project. Any suggestions or workarounds would be very helpful.
Kind regards,
Adam
