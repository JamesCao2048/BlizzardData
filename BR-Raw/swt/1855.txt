SWT.CHECK|SWT.VIRTUAL tables behave differently on Win32 and GTK/Linux
Build ID: 3.3
Steps To Reproduce:
Run the attached snippet.
Under Linux item number 2 and 3 aren't passed to the SetData Listener because they where "touched" using setChecked(true) and setChecked(false).
Under Win32 item number 2 (setChecked(false)) is passed to the SetData Listener.
The item which was setChecked(true) is not passed.
Is this correct behaviour at all?
That SetData isn't call when you check items?
