Existing shell window title gets overwritten
If you have an already created window and use Shell.internal_new to pass the handle in, Shell.createHandle will overwrite any existing title.
An example of this can be seen in the 3.3 RC3 build where the toolbar item for eclipse switches to "untitled window" after the workspace chooser disappears.
