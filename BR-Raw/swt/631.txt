Missing AddRef in new Relation
When a Relation is created, a reference needs to be counted right
away in the constructor. This prevents the object from being prematurely
released.
This is similar to the first patch in  Bug 311821 .
Also, this patch calls getAddress() directly to get the target address, which protects against null pointer exceptions.
