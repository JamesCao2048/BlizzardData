Patch for the crash
With recent versions of WebKitGTK+, Eclipse crashes whenever Javadoc hover help is to be displayed in Java editor.
Looks this happens because WebKit doesn't attach a default Authenticate listener and therefore WebKitGTK.soup_session_get_feature() returns 0 in WebKit.create(). See attached patch for fix.
Reproduced with all 3.8, 4.2 and 4.3 versions of SWT.
