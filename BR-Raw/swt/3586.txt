Can't assign command to Ctrl+Backspace
I20030827
Out of the box Ctrl+Backspace should delete the previous word.
Somehow the key
binding manager thinks this is Ctrl+Del and deletes the next word.
If I try to reassing the key via key pref page it displays Ctrl+Del when I press
Ctrl+Backspace.
I have a Swiss German Keyboard using Swiss German Locale.
