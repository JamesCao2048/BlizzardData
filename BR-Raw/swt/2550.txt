ScrollBar does not receive SWT.Selection messages
This problem was noticed when using the Tree widget.
I noticed that if the Tree contains a horizontal
or vertical ScrollBar, scrolling the composite does not redraw the tree.
I tried adding a selection listener
to the horizontal and vertical scrollbars of the tree and the program never receives notification of this
event when you scroll the tree.
