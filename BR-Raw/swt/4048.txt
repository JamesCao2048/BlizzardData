Find/Replace shouldn't replace typed entry with value from history
I'm using the F1 build.
The Find/Replace dialog (accessed through Edit > Find/Replace...) has a history
of recent searches.
When you type in the "Find" or "Replace With" fields it
searches for entries from a previous search.
If it finds one, it replaces what
you have typed with the value from the history.
The search of the history is
case insensitive, which means that the case of what you have typed may be
changed to the case of the value in the history.
In some scenarios this makes it impossible to perform find or replace
operations.
For example, searching for "hello" and replacing it with "hi" then
searching for "Hello" and replacing it with "Hi" is not possible.
For me, it is
very common to perform operations like this.
I think the current behaviour to be changed to something more simple which
allows the full range of find and replace operations to be performed.
It would
be better if what I type isn't replaced with a value from the history.
The current behaviour seems to be similar to "autocomplete" which is
particularly common in browsers.
In the future, perhaps, a full "autocomplete"
feature could be provided.
But this should still respect the case of what the
user types.
Until then, I think the feature should be removed.

To reproduce:
- Open a document so that Edit>Find/Replace...
becomes available.
- Choose Edit>Find/Replace...
- Type "a" into the Find field.
- Click "Find".
- Try to type "A" into the Find field.
You shouldn't be able to.
The behaviour is similar for the Replace With field.
