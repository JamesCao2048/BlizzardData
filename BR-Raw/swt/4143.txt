OleControlSIte doesn't propagate WM_SETFOCUS message to an ActiveX control
OleControlSite seems not to propagate WM_SETFOCUS message to its child ActiveX
control.
Try following steps:
1.Open an editor which hosts an ActiveX control by using SWT,
2.Set keyboard focus to the editor
3.Open eclipse's preference dialog
4.Close the dialog
Then keyboard focus isn't restored to the ActiveX control.
OleControlSite's(Actually Composite's) setFocus() method
gets called, but it doesn't propagate WM_SETFOCUS message to
the child ActiveX control.
