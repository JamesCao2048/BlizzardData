Spinner: getSelection() during modify event should return new value (enable dynamic behaviour)
This is a cleaned-up version of  bug 94065 .
SWT-win32, v3137 (3.1RC2)
[The basics]
- The selection of the spinner widget (the numeric value)
can be queried by calling getSelection()
- When the text in the spinner changes, a modify event is fired.
This can happen if
* The user clicks on the up/down button (or uses the arrow keys)
* The user types or pastes some digits or clears the text
[The problem]
When a modify event occurs, you will want to know the new selection value.
In order to get it you call getSelection() inside the modifyText handler.
If the event has occurred because the user has clicked on the up/down
button or has used the arrow up/down keys, there is no problem;
getSelection() will return the expected value in this case.
If, however, the event was issued due to the user typing (or pasting)
some digits, the situation is different.
The expectation here is that
getSelection() would return the number represented by the newly-typed
text, but this does not happen.
Instead the old value is returned.
[An example]
Let's say the spinner is set to 50.
The user selects the text "50" and replaces it by typing 123.
Expected events:
- modify event, getSelection() = 1
- modify event, getSelection() = 12
- modify event, getSelection() = 123
Actual events:
- modify event, getSelection() = 50
- modify event, getSelection() = 50
- modify event, getSelection() = 50
As you can see, three notifications that the text has changed are issued
but there is no way of actually retrieving that text or, more importantly,
the number it represents.
In other words, the events are pretty useless.
Only once/if the user presses Return or the spinner loses focus will
a modify event with the right selection be fired.
[Why this is a problem]
When some property (selection, text, ...) of widget A changes, you may
want to update other widgets (B, C, ...) to immediately reflect this
change in some way.
The spinner widget is no different here.
For example, if you have A) a spinner that lets the user choose the
font size and B) a font preview canvas, you will want to update B
when A changes.
This means, if the user types "12" into the spinner,
you will want to show a 12pt sample text in the preview canvas.
Right now, this is not possible.
Typing "12" is not enough, the user
would have to press Return afterwards or move the focus to some
other widget.
[Snippet]
For a demonstration of the above, use the code in  comment #1 .
Two things to note about the case portrayed by the snippet:
1.The user may expect the preview pane to be dynamically updated while
he's typing a new value and may be irritated if this does not happen.
(I know I was.) Users know that they have to press Return when the
drop down box of a combo is open but do they know they need to press
Return in an SWT spinner?
Or Tab, then Shift+Tab as a workaround?
2.Most spinner widgets can be found in dialogs, as is the case here.
Pressing Return in a dialog will activate the defau
