JPEGQuantizationTable precision=8 values can be negative
DQT values should be non-negative, either 0..255 or 0..65535 depending on the sample precision.
Bug: When precision=8 JPEGQuantizationTable is loaded with signed bytes.
(When precision=16, unsigned values are loaded as expected.)
This bug can have dramatic effects, but probably hasn't been noticed because the default Q tables contain only a couple values larger than 127...
Fix:
public int[][] getQuantizationTablesValues() {
qk[i] = reference[ofs + i + 1];
=>
qk[i] = reference[ofs + i + 1] & 0xFF;
