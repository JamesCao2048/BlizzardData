Odd Display of WindowBuilder in Eclipse 3.8/4.2 on Linux

I installed WindowBuilder in the latest integration build of Eclipse 4.2.
As I tried to open a SWT application in SWT Designer, Eclipse prompted me something about Compiz and if it can render it into a separate Window. Unfortunately I did not note done the exact text.
The palette of WindowBuilder is rendered strangely, see attached screenshot.
I currently don't know if the issue is created by the Compiz Window manager, Eclipse 4.2 or Ubuntu 11.10.
WindowBuilder runs fine in Eclipse 3.7 but here I also didn't get the Compiz popup.
Let me know if need more information.
