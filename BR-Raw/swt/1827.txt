Closing a context menu programmatically does not always work when the parent shell is not active.
I'll attach a snippet, which opens and closes a context menu twice. When I run the snippet without touching the mouse, it nicely reaches the last step (6). But when I activate another window right after starting the snippet, it hangs while showing the context menu for the second time at:
OS.TrackPopupMenu(int, int, int, int, int, int, RECT) line: not available [native method]
Menu._setVisible(boolean) line: 230
Display.runPopups() line: 3772
Display.readAndDispatch() line: 3351
SnippetMenuStaysOpen.main(String[]) line: 61
Context: I tried to write a leak test that opens an editor, opens and closes the context menu, closes the editor, and then verifies that no instance of the editor is present in the system. The test works fine as long as the target Eclipse window has focus, but it hangs when I try to do something else on the same machine.
