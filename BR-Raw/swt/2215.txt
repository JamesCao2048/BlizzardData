Read only text widget renders background differently with WIN XP Theme
The text widget that describes the contents of the page on a properties page needs to be made transparent instead of just gray. Setting the background to gray does not work under Windows XP default theme which renders the tabs a lighter shade of gray. Will attach a screen shot.
The text widget has the SWT.READ_ONLY bit set as well as using the .setEditable(false) method.
Reproducer (sorry for the dependencies on WTP)
1. Install latest maintenance version of WTP 1.5
2. Create new J2EE Enterprise Application Project
3. Create new EJB Project
4. Create new Dynamic Web Project
5. Get Properties for Web Project
6. Click on J2EE Module Dependencies in tree.
You should see two tabs (J2EE Modules and Web Libraries). The description in each tab will have a different background from the TabFolder.
