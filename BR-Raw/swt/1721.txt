Repaint cheeze with editor bottom right corner
I've noticed this on both my home and work WinXP installs, for latest
integration build (1210).
1. open the eclipse workbench
2. open an editor
3. place another browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) overtop the workbench
4. move the second browser around such that the bottom right corner of the
editor (where the scroll bars meet) is partially exposed
The result is horizontal lines left in the bottom right editor box which
appear to be the border of the top browser.  Its only true for horizontal
browser edges, not vertical.
