[Import/Export] Usability problem with the Import > Existing Project into Workspace
1) Select File > Import > Existing Project into Workspace.
2) Select root directory, click browse and select a directory that contains some
projects...
this will populate the 'Projects' tree.
3) Notice that the radio button for 'Select archive file' is now selected (and
not the 'select root directory' button).
4) Click the 'Refresh' button
- All of the projects in the 'Projects' view will
now disappear as a result of the 'select archive file' radio button being selected.
