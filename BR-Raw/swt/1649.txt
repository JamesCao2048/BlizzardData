org.eclipse.swt.events.LineStyleEvent doesn't keep the style when multiple listener are listening
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a StyleText widget
2. Add more than 1 LineStyleListener
3. The event.styles attribute is always null but should keep styles that have been set by other listener triggered before. Without that, it seems difficult to add several styleRanges from several listeners.
More information:
in LineStyleEvent constructor, we should have 1 more line :
styles = e.styles;
