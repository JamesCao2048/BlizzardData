Ctrl-Click doesn't select underlying item before bringing up context menu
I2003-03-07
Using Ctrl-Click to bring up the context menu of an item within a tree view doesn't select the underlying item.
Instead the context menu works on the current selection.
(Didn't try whether this is also true for right-clicking)
