Up and Down arrow keys don't work in RTL text
There is an I18N issue regarding RTL text in a text document. Here is how to reproduce it:
1. Open a text editor (for example attached UTF-8 text) and write some LTR and RTL content in it.
2. go to a line, ending with RTL content and press end button. Now press Up/Down button. You can see that up/down arrow keys don't work in some locations, when for example you press Up and the upper line (ending with RTL text) has less characters that current line. Same happens when pressing Down arrow key and the bottom line has less characters.
This happens in Eclipse 3.7.0, 3.7.1, and STS 2.7.x
