Snippet reproducing the problem
Build ID: M20080221-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
Under certain circumstances the OS (Win XP sp 2) will repaint a button, but no SWT.Paint event will be sent.
I have noticed this on traversal primarily, and can reproduce it consistently and across machines.
I will attach a snippet.
I have tried this in XP using SWT 3.2.2 and 3.3.2, and as far as I can tell all styles of buttons have the problem, but no other widgets that I have tried.
problem.

In the snippet, run the snippet as a java application and a shell will open.
There are three buttons, and the last one has a red box drawn on it.
Hit the tab key and the box goes away.
Tab and Shift+Tab between the first and second button and the box is not shown.
Mouse over or tab to the button and the box is drawn again, and stays drawn.
