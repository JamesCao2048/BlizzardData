Rendering problems on Customize Perspective dialog
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050811-0010
When i opened the Customize Perspective dialog the area between the first and
second panels is drawing incorrectly.  It appears as if the text from the editor
is showing through.  This area is covered by a sash.
