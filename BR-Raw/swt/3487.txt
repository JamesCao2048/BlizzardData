Combo behavior not very user-friendly
We have a DROP_DOWN combo (not READ_ONLY) and we listen to it for default
selection events.  There are a couple of problems:
1) When the user selects something with the mouse from the drop-down, the drop-
down disappears, but the default selection event is not fired.  The user has to
then hit "Enter" to do that.  Listening for selection changes doesn't help us
because it is fired all the time, including when the user uses arrow-keys to
navigate the drop-down.
2) If you have an item on the drop-down selected, hitting Enter should close
the drop-down and fire widget default selected.  This is what happens if your
Combo is READ_ONLY.  If not, then the drop-down does not close (although
default selection event is fired).
