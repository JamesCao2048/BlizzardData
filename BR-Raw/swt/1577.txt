DBCS3.4: Dragged texts from Safari gets garbled when dropped on a StyledText widget
Created  attachment 96812   [details]
Source text data (open with Safari)
OS: Mac OS X 10.5.2 (intel)
Build: 3.4M6a (SWT v3436)
Locale: ja_JP.UTF-8 (Japanese
- Japan)
Steps:
1.Open the attached HTML file in Safari
2.Create a simple project and a text file.
Make sure its encoding is set to UTF-8.
3.Open the text file with (workbench's general) text editor.
4.Select whole text in "line1" or "line1a" on Safari and drag&drop it onto the text editor of Step 3
5.Most of the resulted characters on the text editor are garbled as shown in the attached screen image.
SWT Snippet 210 would be an alternative to the text editor.
Drop the text on the right side (target side) of the window.
Expected:
All of the characters are copied correctly.
More info:
1) By using Firefox 2.0, it is successful to drag&drop all texts from Firefox to StyledText widget.
2) Texts in "line2" or "line2a" include user-defined characters.
They are not copied in the text editor by drag&drop from Safari, while Firefox is successful.
This is another phenomenon, but the cause of the problem may be identical.
