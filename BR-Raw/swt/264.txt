There's this bug about not seeing the text cursor:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=275589
I can see the text cursor, but the mouse cursor is pretty much invisible on a black background.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Eclipse 3.7 64-bit on OSX Lion
2.Change your editor background to pure black
3.Move mouse cursor to the black editor area, and the mouse cursor will pretty much "blend into the background"
