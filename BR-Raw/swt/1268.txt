[DND] Drag from multiple sources in heirarchy does not show proper drag image.
When dragging multiple items of the same type from at least two different projects in the Package Explorer, the mouse drag-over image only displays whatever items are in the first package instead of everything that is selected.
Note that dragging multiple objects from different hierarchical sources within a project works fine.
