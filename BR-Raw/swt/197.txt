A combo in a toolbar gets shrunk
The combo boxes placed in the editor toolbar for the ecorediag editor get set to 1 pixel wide.
Walked through it with Bogdan, but a SWT.SEPARATOR toolitem called with toolItem.setWidth(223) seems to get its width reset on the parent (ToolBar) relayout().
The ToolItem.getBounds() returns a width of 1.  Something similar to this can be seen in Snippet58 if the combo/toolitem code sets the control first and the width second.
combo.select(1);
combo.pack ();
sep.setControl (combo);
sep.setWidth (combo.getSize ().x);
