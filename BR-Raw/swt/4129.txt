Column resize problems/cheese
build 20020426
Run the test case below.
Start a column resize and move the column resize indicator (the black vertical
line)one pixel to the right of the old column column grid line.
Release the mouse and observe:
a) the column isn't resized even though the resize indicator leads me to
believe it will be one pixel wider
b) the resize indicator is not erased
On a related note: When I release the mouse/column resize indicator directly on
the column grid line the column is resized smaller.
It looks like somewhere something is off by one.
