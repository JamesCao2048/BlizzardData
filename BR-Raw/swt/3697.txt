StyledText - NPE when using RIGHT_TO_LEFT style with StyledText on Linux
build 20030520
Using the RIGHT_TO_LEFT style in StyledText on platforms other than Windows
results in a NullPointerException in StyledTextBidi.
The problem is that we are testing for the RIGHT_TO_LEFT style to determine
whether we should operate in right oriented mode.
We should be testing for the
MIRRORED style.
Testing for MIRRORED will be sufficient as long as it is only
set on Windows (the only platform we support bidi on).
