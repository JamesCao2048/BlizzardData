scroll problem in tree, table, and list
RC2
- open a Java Editor  on some non-empty Java file
- use Ctrl+O (Show Outline)
-> even if the tree is  so small that it fits into the widget it has vertical and horizontal scroll
bars
-> you can scroll the tree completely out of the visible area
Closing the outline with ESC makes it reproducible.
