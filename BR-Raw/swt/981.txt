Tree item icons drawn into next column

When the first column of a tree has icons, but is too narrow to show the whole icon, then the image leaks into the next column (shows up behind text).
To reproduce in the ControlExample, I had to select/unselect the tree items to force a redraw.
In the Problems view, I saw this right on startup.
Resizing the first column doesn't correct the problem immediately
-- need to force a redraw again.
