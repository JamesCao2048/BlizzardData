Increasing height of table rows via MeasureItem listener affects row height but not line height (OS X)
Build ID: M20071115-1247
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Add a MeasureItem listener on a table that is drawing grid lines
2.Increase the event.height in the event handler
3.Notice that the height of text is increased but the line height has not
More information:
Example:  adding this listener to a table causes the lines to be drawn poorly initially.
They're fixed when the table redraws.
See attached screenshot and full snippet.
table.addListener(SWT.MeasureItem, new Listener()
{
public void handleEvent(Event event)
{
event.height = 30;
}
});
