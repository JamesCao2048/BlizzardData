Resetting alpha to 0xFF has no effect

Snippet that demonstrates the problem under Mac OS X Cocoa
I am doing some painting using advanced graphics.
In particular I've noticed problems with the following sequence:
1.Paint something using alpha
2.Revert alpha to 0xFF
3.Draw text
At third step the text is drawn with the alpha value that was used in the 1st step.
Drawing something different than text in the 3rd step works as expected.
I am attaching the snippet and the screenshots that show the problem.
