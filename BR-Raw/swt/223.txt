WinICOFileFormat cannot handle 256x256 icons
Build Identifier: M20110909-1335
The standard windows ico format supports icons up to 256x256 pixel in size. However as widht and height are stored in byte values 256 pixel widht/height is represented as 0 (see also  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)#Icon_resource_structure ).
Due to this fact the width/height of the ico header differs from the width/height in the BMP info header and the validation check at WinICOFileFormat.java:207 fails.
Possible solution is to map a width/height of 0  in the ico header to 256 like it is done for numColors.
Kind Regards,
Holger
