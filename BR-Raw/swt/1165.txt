keyUp not delivered if command key is down
An SWT.KeyUp will not be delivered if the command key is down while pressing another key. This can be seen in ControlExample in the Text tab. Turn on the listeners for KeyDown and KeyUp and then type any command key combination that isn't already a menu equivalent. You will get a KeyDown for the cmd key, then a KeyDown for the regular key, but no KeyUp. Then you get a KeyDown for the command key.
