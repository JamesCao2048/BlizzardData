Created  attachment 136873   [details]
Source Code for problem reproduction
Build ID: I20090515-1143
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Run the attached source in Eclipse 3.5 RC1.
2.Notice that the Generated Paths result in different appearances between SWT-Cocoa-3.5 and SWT-Carbon-3.4.2.
3.Try removing the Path.close() and observe effect.
One should conclude that there is something wrong with the generated path when close() is used.
Other explanations are possible but should be obvious to the SWT Cocoa team.

This bug probably has the same root cause (in SWT) as BIRT  Bug #277464  ( https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=277464 ).
