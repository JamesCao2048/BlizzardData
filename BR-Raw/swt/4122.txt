Copying content in more than format to Clipboard only registers one
build 20020502
-Run org.eclipse.swt.examples.texteditor.TextEditor
-type some text
-select the text and copy it to the clipboard
-paste the text into notepad
->this works so there must be non RTF text in the clipboard
-in Wordpad check the available clipboard formats using Edit-Paste Special
->Only RTF shows up, we put RTF and unformatted text into the clipboard.
This works in SWT build 2012b and is broken in build 2013.
