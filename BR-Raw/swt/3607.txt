BIDI: StyledText has problem with drawing of selection in both ltr and rtl orientation of this widget in the bidi locale.
This problem was reported in the  bug 30434 .
Vertical line, which has width of
some pixels, sometimes remains with it's current background between two
selected characters.
We suggested to solve it by widening of area, which should
be redraw, by some pixels.
Lynne Kues wrote in the  comment #43  to  bug 30434 ,
that "...After much discussion, we've decided StyledText needs to work around
Bug 37427 / Bug 4776 .
We will put back the magic + 1 in StyledText.redraw
(int,int,int,int, boolean)".
In the code of StyledText it seems as follow:
if (isBidi()) {
// workaround for  bug 4776
super.redraw(x, y, width + 1, height, all);
} else {
super.redraw(x, y, width, height, all);
}
Unfortunately, this change can't solve the problem: 1) because area for drawing
should be expanded from both sides; 2) because 1 pixel isn't always enough, and
for large fonts this difference can achieve 2,3 and even 4 pixels.
Therefore we suggest to perform following changes in the method
StyledTexBIDI.redrawRange(): redraw area, which is started from character
before current DirectionRun and ended by character, which is visually follow
this DirectionRun.
