[Widgets] Windows 7 Jump List items impose "standard" on arguments passed to new instance
Build Identifier: 3.6M6
Recently implemented Windows 7 Jump List (which is awesome) items impose "standard" on argumants that are passed to new instance with pattern like shown below:
--launcher.openFile /SWTINTERNAL_ID101
It's used solely on Eclipse, but for applications that are not using Eclipse exe launcher are confusing and in some cases troublesome.
I've made quick fix on my local build of SWT, but would like to suggest streamlined version of it, for use in other applications, I can provide patch for it, essentially I've used Widget's data property "argument" that overrides default argument passed to new instance.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create Windows 7 Jump List items (TaskItem inside TaskBar)
2. Use newly created item to launch new instance of application
