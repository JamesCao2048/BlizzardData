[encoding] DBCS3.2: some DBCS is displayed as dot on default font on WinXP/2003
OS:		windows 2003
Language:	Japanese
Build level: 	I200405211200
JDK version:  IBM JDK 1.4.2 Beta
Steps to recreate problem:
1-launch a brand new Eclipse and checkout pre-defined java project
2-open a java file that contains Japanese text
....
Error:  all of katakana were displayed as ".", and Japanese comma was bogus
Expected Result: in Eclipse 2.1.3, these characters were displayed fine.
I guess font substitution in SWT has some errors for Japanese font.
