Drag not working in I20070205-0009
Dragging views doesn't work in this build.
Occasionally you'll get the ability to drag a view to a new place but what happens is that a different view is dragged.
After this you cannot drag at all
- you get the drag rectangle with the X cursor.
It is sometimes the case that you're in this state right from the get-go.
