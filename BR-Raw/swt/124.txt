sample project
After opened a FileDialog or DirectoryDialog, another normal dialog pops up.
All buttons in the two dialogs cannot work.
However, you cannot close either dialog except killing it.
This issue happens with the cocoa SWT libraries (e.g.
org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx_3.7.2.v3740f-RCP20120928-1700.jar).
I reproduced this issue on Mac 10.8.2 and Mac 10.7.4.
This issue doesn't happen with the carbon SWT libraries(e.g.
org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx_3.6.2.v3659b-RCP20120727-1500.jar) in another product
I attached the sample code to reproduce this issue.
