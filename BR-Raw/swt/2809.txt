ComputeSize on Link gives different results when calling two times in a row
RC1
I have a Link widgets embeeded in the new Jaba class wizard. The JDT class is
NewClassWizardPage
The text of the link widget is
"Do you want to add comments as configured in the <a>properties</a> of the
current project?"
When I call computeSize of the link using the following code
System.out.println(29 + " " +
children[29].computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT) + " " +
children[29].computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT));
where the Link is the 29th child of a composite I get the following results:
29 Point {408, 13} Point {408, 0}
To reproduce add the following to lines to the end of the createControl in
NewClassWizardPage
Control[] children= composite.getChildren();
System.out.println(29 + " " + children[29].computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT)
+ " " + children[29].computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT));
