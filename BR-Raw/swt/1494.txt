Tree shows horizontal scrollbar although not required
Using this snippet:
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet8.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
on my Mac shows a horizontal scrollbar after I expanded some items, even when
all items fit in the width of the tree and therefor a scrollbar would not be
required.
