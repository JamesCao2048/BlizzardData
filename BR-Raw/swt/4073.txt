Build F2
The priority icons that are shown in task view can be displayed beside the wrong
task.
1) Make sure the task view is empty.
2) Create 3 tasks called 'a', 'b', and 'c'
3) Assign a high priority to task 'a'
4) Select task 'b'
5) Sort by priority repeatedly, by clicking on the table header
6) Notice that whenever 'a' is the bottom task, that the priority icon is also
shown beside 'c'.
The icon can be cleared by selecting 'c'.
