Hand cursor stays when releasing Ctrl after hovering a link
HEAD
- open a text editor with linkable content
- press and hold Ctrl
- move mouse cursor over a link
=> mouse cursor turns into a hand
- release Ctrl
=> expected (like in 3.4.1): mouse cursor reverts to I-beam
=> was: stays hand until I move the mouse
