[OS X - Cocoa] After moving the shell to another space, rich hover opens on wrong space
Here's the scenario:
1. Open the workbench on space 1. Have a Java editor open (to demonstrate rich hover).
2. Activate Spaces (the feature which shows all the spaces on dark background as overview).
3. Drag the workbench window to space 2.
4. Hover with the mouse over some text in the Java editor.
5. Expected result - rich hover will be shown.
Actual result - you will be taken back to space 1 (involuntarily). The rich hover might be shown on space 1 or 2 - I didn't find a consistent behavior here.
