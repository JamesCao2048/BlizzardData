CheckboxTableViewer does not receive selection events
This bug has appeared in today's integration build  I20040302 and always
worked, including last week's integration build.
Scenario:
1. Help > Software Update > Find and Install ... to launch the install wizard
2. select the second radio button (search for new features)
3. Add update site (URL may wrap):  http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/ %
7Echeckout%7E/platform-update-home/3.0/site/
4. Select the site and press Next, to move to the results page
5. Once you see the list of features on the site, select the checkbox of any
of of them. The expected behavior is to either see an error or to enable the
Next button. In this build nothing happens.
The listener code is in
org.eclipse.update.internal.ui.wizards.ReviewPage at line 432.
I put a breakpoint there but it is never reached.
