StyledText - redrawRange not clearing properly when clear flag set
Run the attached test case.
Check the bold checkbox.
Uncheck the bold checkbox.
Notice that the first and last lines leave bold character cheese even though
the clear flag was specified for the redrawRange call.
Simple/safe fix.
Need to get approval for F3.  This problem is leading to a bug in WSAD.
