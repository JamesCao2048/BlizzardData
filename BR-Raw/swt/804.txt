[ViewForm] View Toolbars should wrap right-aligned
When view toolbars must wrap to a new line because there are too many items for
the view's width, the second etc. lines of toolbar items should also be aligned
to the right. This follows the alignment of the original top line.
The right-alignment would also decrase the distance to the buttons' new location
after wrapping (which can be annoyingly far away when a view like "New Search"
wraps because the title string becomes wider).
