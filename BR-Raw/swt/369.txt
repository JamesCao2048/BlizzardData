Noticed this problem in the IDE with the "Create New Project Wizard".

Steps:

2) Open the child shell.
3) Using Expose select the child shell with mouse.
5) Try to type in the text box or select the button using keyboard, no key input works.
But, mouse input seems to work.
6) close the child shell, parent shell is not activated.
