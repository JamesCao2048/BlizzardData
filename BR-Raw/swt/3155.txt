Posting mouse events locks up event handling
I20040817, WinXP
Experiments with posting mouse events by Display#post(..) in the main thread
locked up while running the event queue.
The main thread would eventually not
return from OS.DispatchMessage(..).
Posting the events from a background thread
works.
Using an additional thread makes the code more complicated and potentially
changes measurements of performance tests.
