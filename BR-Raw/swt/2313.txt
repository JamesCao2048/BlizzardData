Table column tooltip disappears after clicking the header
If you set the tooltip on a table column, tooltips correctly appear when you hover over the column header.
But after you click the header (e.g.
to sort) then the tooltip is not shown for this column until you move the mouse to another column (moving the mouse outside the table doesn't help).
I tried this e.g.
with Snippet38 from  http://www.eclipse.org/swt/snippets/  where I set the tooltip on all column.
Found in Eclipse 3.2RC5.
