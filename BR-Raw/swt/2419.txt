Tree- Random foreground color appears for Tree when selecting items and subitems
Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20060125-0800
-> Run Snippet226
-> Expand some of the tree items so the subitems are visible
-> Note that all the items and subitmes have foreground color grey but as soon as you select one item or a subitem then some of the rows (happens to random rows, not one in particular) become black.
-> Click on various subitems to see the behaviour
I am attaching a screenshot of the bug.
