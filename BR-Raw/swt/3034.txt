Tree: problem with WM_PRINT
I use WM_PRINT under Windows to create image of control that I show outside of
visible screen.
This work Ok for all control except new Tree with columns.
When I try to send it WM_PRINT under WinXP, I see image without headers, only
with items.
Same code works without any problem with Table.
When I ask for
screen shot of full Shell, with all children, I see correct image of Tree, with
headers, but now without items.
Is there any way to have full image, with headers and items?
