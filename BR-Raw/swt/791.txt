[Widgets] Setup of event.detail argument incorrect in Tree paintItem event under Cocoa

Line 1140 of the SWT cocoa source file org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Tree.java sets up the SWT.SELECTED bit incorrectly for the event parameter for the PaintItem event of the Tree.
Currently the line reads:
if (drawSelection) event.detail |= SWT.SELECTED;
The drawSelection variable however is the result of a previous EraseItem event.
According to the spec (and the behavior under Windows) the SWT.SELECTED bit should be set in event.detail when the respective tree cell is actually selected, even when a precious call to EraseItem prevented the drawing of a selection background for the cell by clearing the bit.
Reproducible: Always
Can be easily fixed by changing line 1140 of the SWT cocoa source file org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Tree.java from
if (drawSelection) event.detail |= SWT.SELECTED;
to
if (isSelected) event.detail |= SWT.SELECTED;
