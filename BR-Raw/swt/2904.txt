Program.findProgram("html") fails with Firefox as the default browser
On my Windows machine, Program.findProgram("html") returns null even though my
default browser is correctly set to be Firefox.
The problem is that the
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML key has no value, which makes the name parameter
invalid.
The fix is to use the name of the key (in this case, FirefoxHTML)
instead of trying to look up a real name.
