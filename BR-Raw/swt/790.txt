Scrollables incorrectly redrawn within non rectangular shaped shell.

I have an application with an irregular shaped window created by setting a Region on the shell.
I found that an embedded CheckboxTreeViewer does not draw properly when scrolled.
It seems to incorrectly inherit the region of the shell which then gets scrolled around with the contents of the scrolled tree, preventing areas outside the region from being redrawn properly.
I have modified Snippet285, adding a scrollable List which demonstrates this problem.
I am running 64 bit cocoa, eclipse build id: 20090920-1017. I have also tried an earlier version of 32 bit cocoa which does the same.
It draws fine on carbon.
Is this a bug or am I missing something?
Thanks.
