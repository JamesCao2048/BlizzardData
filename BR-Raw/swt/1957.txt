Negative values not displaying with Read-Only style combo.
I've tried this on XP and Mac OS X...doesn't seem to be a problem on XP.
If you add negative values to a combo box that is of SWT.READ_ONLY style, the negative values do not show up in the drop-down list. If the combo style is  SWT.DROP_DOWN style, negative values that are added to the combo will correctly be displayed in the list.
