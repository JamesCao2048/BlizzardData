CoolBar computeSize fails on windows XP (tested running with the manifest file)
Situation 1:
1 - Resize the workbench windows until the CoolBar wraps.
2 - Maximized the workbench window.
3 - A empty row remains (bug).
Note: It looks like the SetWindowPos do not cause the CoolBar unwrap.
Situation 2:
1 - Play a bit resizing the workbench windows making the CoolBar wrap and
unwrap.
2 - Eventually a empty row appears.
Note: It looks like the compute trim for the coolbar on XP have to consider
more than the border size.
