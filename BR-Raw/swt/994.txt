Rollover tooltips for all truncated tree and table items
I20090427-1800 Cocoa
It looks like rollover tooltips for truncated tree and table items are completely gone again (after  bug 272834 ,  bug 272835 ).
They would be helpful if implemented like on win32 or in Apple's Mail.app. The Finder's way of using a smaller font and multi-line tooltip would also be acceptable, but not preferred.
