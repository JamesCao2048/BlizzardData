wrong selection length in owner drawn table
M7
WinXP
- enable 'Use colors in labels' on Java > Appearance
- open the 'Open Type' dialog (Ctrl + Shift + T) and enter 'A'
- the selection is larger than the entry
It has actually the same length as the largest so far seen entry
When you scroll down and find a larger entry, the selection will become bigger
