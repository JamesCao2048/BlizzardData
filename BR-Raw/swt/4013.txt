StyledText - mixing text width/caret position is confusing
build 20020321
The concept of caret position and text width used to be interchangeable.
We
always measure text from the beginning of the line to a character offset in the
line which normally is the same as the caret position.
This changed when we added support for margins in SINGLE mode.
When a left
margin is set, the caret positition == text width + leftMargin.
We should make this difference and the concept of caret position == text width
clearer in the doc.
This is especially confusing since we introduced
StyledTextBidi.getCaretPosition which is called in bidiTextWidth and is also
used for caret position *and* text width.
We may want to rename getCaretPosition and the textWidth methods so that they
suggest neither caret position nor text width (getTextPosition ?).
