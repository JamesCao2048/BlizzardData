[content assist] Additional info of newly selected proposal not shown
to reproduce:
# ensure that Eclipse is configured to have javadoc available for Java runtime classes.
# open a Java file in the JDT Java source editor
# in the source declare a stack object as follows: java.lang.Object foo;
# in the source editor on a new line, type: foo
# in the editor use the '.' character to cause content assist to appear with suggestions for methods on 'foo'
# wait for the javadoc to appear for the first content assist entry, the 'equals' method
# type 'g' to filter the list of content assist proposals to those methods starting with 'g'
# observe that the list of proposals is filtered and 'getClass()' proposal is now selected
# observe that the javadoc remains that for the original method displayed, the equals method
