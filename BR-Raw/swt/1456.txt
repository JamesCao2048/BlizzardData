Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.From Control Panel -> Regional and language, select Hebrew
2.Bring up an app. with the following sample code:
MessageBox mb = new MessageBox(PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().getActiveShell());
mb.setMessage(Activator.getResourceString("str.fedcal.action.google.warning"));
3. The English value for str.fedcal.action.google.warning is this:
str.fedcal.action.google.warning=Oops, there are no calendar URLs on this page.  To add a public calendar, you must first open that calendar's Calendar Settings page, then click this button again.nnNote: You can only add public calendars that you own or have already subscribed to.  To make a calendar public, enable sharing from the Calendar Settings page.
4. From the App, you'll see that the MessageBox is correctly displayed with a right to left style.  But, the message is incorrectly displayed from left to right, and aligned on the left.
