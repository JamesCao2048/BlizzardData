Japanese monospace/fixed witdth fonts such as Osaka-Mono are not shown properly.
Environment: Mac OSX 10.4.9/ Eclipse 3.3M6 on Japanse Mac OSX.
Java editor does not display Japanese fonts properly while scrolling editor window or editing source code text.
Procedure to reproduce:
1. Launch Eclipse
2. Go to Preferences>General>Appearance>Colors and Fonts, and see 'Basic' category in the right pane.
3. Change 'Text Font' to Osaka regular-mono font
4. Open a java source file containing Japanese letters (encoded either UTF-8 or Windows-31J)
5. Scroll up and down the editor window and you can see dot garbages and phantoms.
I guess this issue is related to the issue #172215 since the phenomenon I saw is similar to the screenshot.
