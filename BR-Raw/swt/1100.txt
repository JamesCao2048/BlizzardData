Combo.setText does nothing in read-only mode
I20090317-1745.
Combo.setText does nothing in read-only mode, but the Javdoc specifies it sets the text and does not mention any special case when in read-only mode, hence it is considered a bug to ignore setText(...) when in read-only mode.
If this is a WONTFIX then at least the Javadoc should be clarified.
