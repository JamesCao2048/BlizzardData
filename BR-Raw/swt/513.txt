[Browser-Mozilla] Links and JS actions opening a new window do not work
Build Identifier: SWT 3.7M1
When a page contains a link that uses a target="_blank" to open a new window, that link does not work.
This seems to only happen with XULRunner on Mac (32 bit mode, XULRunner 1.9.2.8)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Take Snippet 270
2.Change browser styles to MOZILLA
3.Browser.setText(x) where x contains links with target="_blank"
