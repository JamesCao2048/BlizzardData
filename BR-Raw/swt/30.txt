wrong values from ScrollBar#getThumbBounds (was: [navigation] Mark Occurrences scrollbar position doesn't match)
In Kepler the position of the mark occurrences marker right of the scrollbar doesn't match the scrollbar position.
It is half a cm off (on full HD).
The same applies to mark errors and that like.
This worked much better in pre-Kepler releases.
Use a large source file to test it, click on an identifier and see the marker being misplaced.
