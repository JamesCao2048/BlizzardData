CLabel should allow setting of hIndent and vIndent
CLable defines hIndent and vIndent to a fixed value (3).
This prevents the
widget from fitting into the Forms UI because it is displayed with margin and
not in-line with other widgets (eg.
"Label").
CLabel should have setters and getters for both values.
