All Fonts appear the same
When using fonts in the GraphicsExample application, there does not seem to be any difference in appearance among different fonts names.
Steps for reproducing:
- Check out org.eclipse.swt.examples from CVS
- Put the attached file in your workspace under
org.eclipse.swt.examples.graphics
- Run the graphics example
- In the tree, expand "Font" and select "Custom Font"
- Select different fonts in the drop-down and pay attention to their appearance.
- Problem: they all look the same
