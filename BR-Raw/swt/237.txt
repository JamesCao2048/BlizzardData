[Browser][WebKit] Javadoc tooltip cannot be closed with Esc
Build Identifier: 20110615-0604
Tooltips opened with F2 ("Show Tooltip Description") can be closed by pressing Esc, except Javadoc tooltips. This worked fine in Eclipse-3.4, it ceased to work in 3.7.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter the following into a new Java class with an arbitrary name:
public static void test()
{
final String s = new String();
}
2.
Place the cursor over String and press F2. A javadoc tooltip appears. Press Esc, nothing happens, the tooltip remains on the screen.
Place the cursor over s, which is underlined in yellow, and press F2. The warning appears in a tooltip. Press Esc, and the tooltip disappears.
