ImageLoader.save cannot set JPEG compression ratio
When saving an image to JPEG, there is no way to set the compression ratio.
And at the same time the default compression seems to be quite high (~20%), and
images are really not looking good at the default compression rate.
Could we either:
- set the compression rate when saving?
- or at least haev a default compression rate much lower? A modest increase in
size wuold result in a usable file format for image saving.
Thanks!
