Control in vertical ToolBar doesn't fit
- observed on win32, solaris-motif and solaris-gtk (kindof), so this should
probably be tried everywhere
- run the ControlExample, go to the ToolBar tab
- turn on the Combo Child checkbox
- select the SWT.VERTICAL radio
- you'll end up with something like the attachment (there are supposed to be 7
full toolitems before the Combo, but only about 6.1 of them are shown)
