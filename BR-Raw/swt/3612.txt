Selection events not fired from Combo
Build 20030703
It looks like Combo boxes don't fire selection events. We have code that creates
a Combo and registers a selection listener. On Win32, a selection event is
received when the user selects an item from the Combo. On Linux-GTK, no event is
received.
Our code for creating the Combo and registering the adapter is in org.eclipse.
jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.
RuntimeClasspathAdvancedDialog#createDialogArea(Composite). This bug blocks our
solution to  Bug 39486 .
