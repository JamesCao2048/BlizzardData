Empty space before handle in a coolbar
CVS HEAD from yesterday
If a toolbar has a shadow, there is a blank space visible after the toolbar and
before the next gripper in a coolbar.
Attached is a screenshot showing the
problem, and a patch I made that fixes the problem, but only after I grab the
adjacent gripper and move it.
