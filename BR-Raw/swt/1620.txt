Tooltips not shown for some widgets
On RedHat 9 and SuSE tooltips are not displayed in predictable or consistent
manner in StyledText and Tree controls (possibly others).
When mouse hovers
over tree item whose text is too long to fit in the Tree control horizontally
-
tooltip must be displayed with full item's text.
This happens only occasionaly
on these platoforms.
The same with StyledText.
When there are some regions that
must display tootips (not the entire Styledtext widget), these tooltips also
displayed *very* rarely.
