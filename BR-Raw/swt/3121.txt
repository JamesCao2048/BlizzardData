Display.getShells() optimization
Display.getShells() and Disply.getActiveShell() methods are called in eclipse
very frequently. For example during opening of 40 Java editors Display.getShells
() was called about 12 000 times and this method took 2.2% of total scenario
execution time.
This is due to widgetTable, which contains hundreds of widgets, is scanned each
time. However amount of non-disposed shells is about 2-4 depending on amount of
opened dialogs. So it is better to keep separate array of non-disposed shells
rather than scan throw widgetTable.
In next post I am going to attach this patch.
