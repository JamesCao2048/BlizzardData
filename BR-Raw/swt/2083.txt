TabFolder should not use PtCalcCanvas in getClientArea
Due to the nature of the widget PtPanelGroup, you cannot use PtCalcCanvas to get
the widgets drawing area.
There is a limitation in photon where you cannot draw
a surface outside of a widgets canvas.
The tabs are control surfaces.
Therefore if you use PtCalcCanvas to determine the drawing area, you will
overwrite the tabs.
I will attach a patch to fix this.
