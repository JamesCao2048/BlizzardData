[OLE] Saving docx file will corrupt the file and produce OLE exception
I have created an RCP application. I can open microsoft office documents 2007 inside, with the docx extension. But if I modify the document and save it, the save operation corrupts the document somehow. Next time when I try to open it from the RCP application, I got an OLE exception "cannot create the in place editor". If I try to open the document directly with microsoft office, the error is "the file is corrupted". However if I chose to restore it, the file can be restored correctly. And now the weird thing is that the size of the document after the save from the RCP application is changing from 20ko to 99ko. It looks like some garbage is added in the docx document.
I got exactly the same error if I try the same thing directly in the eclipse IDE. I have eclipse 3.3 and jre1.5.0_11.
To duplicate:
1. Copy a docx file into a project directory.
2. Open this docx file inside Eclipse IDE. The file should be opened without any problem.
3. Modify the file, and save.
4. Close the file editor tab.
5. Open the file again, get following exception:
Cannot create the in-place editor
Reason:
This is probably because there is no OLE editor registered against the type of file you were trying to open.
Details:
Failed to create Ole Client. result = -2147467260
6. Use Open With -> System Editor, get following message:
The Office Open XML file test.docx cannot be opened because there are problems with the contents.
Details: The file is corrupt and cannot be opened.
This is a serious issue for our project as our application allows user to edit MS documents in-place. As more and more customers are using Office 2007, this is a show stopper for us.
Thanks.
