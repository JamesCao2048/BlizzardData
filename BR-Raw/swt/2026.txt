BIDI: StyledText does not paint selection well when mirrored
When we have a styledText widget, in RTL mode (Right to Left), and we select some text, the selection drawing is not perfect.
On the first line, it seems that the higlighting begins one pixel after it should, and the first char is bolder.
On the next lien,one character in the line is "Bolder" then the others, this happens at the last line of the selection, as shown in the pic.
