[Accessibility] Font attributes are repeated at the beginning of lines
I20100516-0800
When voiceover is turned on, font attributes of text will be read out at the start of a line even when the font hasn't changed over a run of text.
To reproduce:
1.Make sure text attributes are being read out.
In VoiceOver Utility, select Verbosity
-> Text, and make sure 'When text attributes change:" says "Speak Attributes".
2.Run CustomControlExample.
3.Select the last word of the first line and the first word of the second line.
4.Make the text bold.
5.Click on the word "Two"
6.Click on the word "The"
===> You hear the font attribute being read out.
The font didn't change from the default, so the font attribute shouldn't have been read.
