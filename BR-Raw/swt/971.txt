Accessibility - Console message printed when custom control has focus
Run VoiceOver and give focus to a CTabFolder tab or the maximize or minimize button in a CTabFolder.
The following message is printed to the Console:
20/05/09 1:04:48 PM eclipse[92305] ***
-[SWTAccessibleDelegate accessibilityIsAttributeSettable:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xc7f91f0
The message is printed many times.
This probably began happening when  bug 274273  was fixed.
We should fix this for 3.5 RC2.
