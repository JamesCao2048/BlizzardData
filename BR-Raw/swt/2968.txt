Fixed size columns used even if fixed_height_mode not supported
To support VIRTUAL, we need to use the fixed_height_mode property which is new
in GTK+ versions 2.3.2 and up.
However, this means we need to size the column
ourselves.
For versions that don't support fixed_height_mode, we might as well
let GTK+ do the column sizing itself (using AUTOSIZE) since it will be faster.
I am not sure if maybe we need to do something similar in Tree...
