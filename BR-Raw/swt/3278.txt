Label does not draw background correctly
3.0 RC3
Works correctly everywhere except motif.
Bring up the tooltip for the tab item on a CTabFolder.
The "yellow" filling does not extend all the way down to the black border.
There is one row of pixels across the bottom that is in the default background
colour.
