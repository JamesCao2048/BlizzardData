nullpointer dispose table column
When I dispose a table column I get a nullpointer at line 518 in table.java.
My table model is only text (no column images).
Since I am not using images
in my table, public Image getColumnImage(Object obj, int index), returns null
which causes the nullpointer.
If I return a "bogus" image, the problem is
resolved.
This did not happen in 2.0.x and is new in 2.1.x (M5 is the
first 2.1 version I have used).
