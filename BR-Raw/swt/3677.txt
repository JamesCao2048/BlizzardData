GC.drawRoundedRectangle(...) method doesn't include the right and bottom edge
The GC.drawRoundedRectangle(...) method doesn't include the right and
bottom edge.  I'm using WinXP and swt-win32-2133.dll.
This behavior is inconsistent with the other APIs such as drawRectangle,
drawOval, etc..., that include the bottom and right edge, and on GTK the
rounded rectangle is drawn correctly with all 4 edges included.
For the fill API GC.fillRoundRectangle(...) that should exclude the edges, it
actually doubles up and excludes two pixels of theright and bottom edges.
