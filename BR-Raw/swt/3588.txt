Build 20020621
Linux-GTK
1.Hover a button until the hover help for the button appears.
2.Press Ctrl+F1 to summon the "F1 help."
3.The F1 help appears under the hover help, making it impossible to read the
obscured text.
Also, the original hover help is now stuck.
It won't go away
even when clicking elsewhere.
