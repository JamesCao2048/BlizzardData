Regression: Drop target has incorrect DND cursor
SWT-win32, v3223
In the example below, there is a somewhat uncooperative drop target
that does not accept any kind of transfer.
Expected result when attempting to drag objects over the shell:
No drop cursors should be visible (except for the "veto sign")
Actual result:
Cursors such as COPY or LINK appear, depending on the drag source
The problem is not limited to an empty transfer list.
For example, if the drop target accepts only file transfers,
non-veto cursors will appear even when a piece of text is dragged.
This bug is not reproducible with v3218 and earlier.
