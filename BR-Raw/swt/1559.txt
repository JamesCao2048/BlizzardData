[JFace] Slower image painting due to fix for 
I20080515-2000.
The fix for  bug 219432  and  bug 224422  results in faster image loading.
Good.
Unfortunately lots of our images (e.g.
editor tabs) are now drawn slower because the following optimization in ImageDescriptor is no longer in place:
if (data.transparentPixel >= 0) {
ImageData maskData = data.getTransparencyMask();
return new Image(device, data, maskData);
}
and hence GC.drawBitmapTransparent(...) gets now called.
This is responsible for about 1/4 of the regression seen in JDT Text editor
activation tests.
On my machine this is 30-50 ms.
I had a chat with Silenio and according to him not all image types and all OSs are actually that much faster in loading.
Especially for GIFs which we use in the SDK it might not pay off that much.
Sileno promised me to give us advice here, so that eventually we can also revert to the old code for some image types/OSs.
