GC.drawLine and GC.drawPolyline aren't consistent [portability]
On Windows, gc.drawLine(10,10,20,20) and gc.drawPolyLine(new int[]
{10,10,20,20}) do not do the same thing.  drawPolyline is omitting the last
pixel.  The effect of this is that when drawing "connections" between boxes,
the connection meets the box at one end, but has a 1-pixel gap at the other end.
Also, when drawing a hollow arrow tip that looks like "<", one side of the
arrow is smaller than the other because one side is missing a pixel.
I cannot think of any workaround that will still work correctly with both XOR
and the various line STYLES.
Is this consistent across all platforms?
