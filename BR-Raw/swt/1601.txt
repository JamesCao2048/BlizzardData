Control#setCapture() not working as expected
Eclipse 3.2
According to the JavaDoc of Control#setCapture(), "causes the receiver to have all mouse events delivered to it until the method is called with false".
See this snippet:
public class Main {
static Tree t;
public static void main(String[] args) {
Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
Button b = new Button(shell, SWT.NONE);
b.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() {
public void widgetDefaultSelected(SelectionEvent e) {
t.setCapture(true);
}
});
t = new Tree(shell, SWT.NONE);
for (int i = 0; i
< 100; i++) {
new TreeItem(t, SWT.None).setText("Hello World");
}
shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch()) {
display.sleep();
}
}
}
}
Hitting the Button, I begin using my MouseWhell to scroll, but the Tree is not scrolling.
From what the JavaDoc tells me, I had expected this behaviour.
Since I more think that this is a platform-limitation than a bug in setCapture() , at least the JavaDoc should clarify what this API is about.
