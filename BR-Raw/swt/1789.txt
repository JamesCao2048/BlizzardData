Inconsistent Spinner behaviour across platforms
On Mac and GTK, when the user enters a Spinner field the text within the text component of the Spinner is automatically selected, as it is for other Text controls.
On Windows however (Tested on Vista with 3.3.1) the control gains focus but the text is not selected.
As per Carolyn's note below this should be resolved.
Original thread from the newsgroup is below.

Hi, Brandon.
Actually, the behavior is inconsistent between the platforms.
On Mac and GTK, the Spinner's text *is* selected, but on Windows it isn't.
This should be fixed.
Can you please open a bug report?
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Platform
and set the Component: to SWT.
Thanks!
Carolyn
