The "Device#getFontList" method does not return an array of size 0 for a bad face name
I ran into this bug trying to fix a UI test that fails on Mac OS X but passes on
Windows and Linux.
It fails because it expects an array of size 0 to be returned
by the "getFontList" method when it is passed a bad face name.
I executed the following line of code on Windows XP, Mac OS 10.3.3 and Linux GTK:
System.out.println(display.getFontList("badData",true).length)
Linux and Windows XP both print 0.On the Mac, it returns an array of size 144.
The array contains all null values.
I noticed that this particular problem occurs in GTK but is corrected at the end
of the method.
It is corrected in the "Device#getFontList()" method by copying
the non null values into a results array and returning it.
I could not find the "expected" return value for a bad face name in the API
documentation, but I am guessing the "getFontList" method should behave as it
does on Windows and Linux, which is to return an array of size 0.
I am using build id 200408110800.
