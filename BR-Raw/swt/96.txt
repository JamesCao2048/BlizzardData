Eclipse freezes when hovering over value in Variables view
Eclipse freezes when hovering over value in Variables view.
Longer tooltip results in longer freeze, up to several minutes.
Problem is reproducible on Windows 7 using 3.8.1, 4.2.1 and latest I-build.
Steps below use Java class as an example, but the problem is reproducible also when debugging applications written in other languages.
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create the following Java class:
----------%<-----------
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder(15000);
for (int i = 0; i
< 15000; i++) {
buf.append(' ');
}
String s = buf.toString();
System.out.println(s); // breakpoint here
}
}
----------%<-----------
2.Set breakpoint in the marked line.
3.Debug as Java application.
4.When breakpoint is hit, go to Variables view and hover over value of s.
=> Eclipse freezes and does not respond.
