Browser.setText() sometimes appends dust characters after html
In DocumentComplete event handling block,
Browser allocates memory with size of UTF8BOM and html, but does not care for
stream size.
GlobalAlloc rounds its size, so allocated memory size is different from
required size.
Without GMEM_ZEROINIT, memory will be rough.
IStream eats them
unrequired garbage.
It should be allocated with GMEM_ZEROINIT.
Or stream size should be set by IStream.SetSize (this is better but not
implemented now).
