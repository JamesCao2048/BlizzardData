reducing VIRTUAL Table's item count can show drawing problem
3.1
- run the MassiveTableTest
- invoke Table2->SetItemCount with a value of 50
- scroll to the very bottom of the Table
- invoke Table2->SetItemCount with a value of 45
- this reduces the item count, but does not paint the result properly

-> this will happen whenever a Table's top index changes as a result of a
reduced SetItemCount (so when the user is scrolled near the bottom of the Table)
