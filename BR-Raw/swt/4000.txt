System.out.println("Hi");
System.out.println("Hi");
System.out.println("Hi");
System.out.println("Hi");

}
- set breakpoint on first line
- launch under debugger
- wait until debugger settles down at breakpoint
- hit F6
- nothing happens
- wiggle mouse
- the step occurs
You may need to wiggle the mouse even to get to the breakpoint (seems to
affect all debug events, not just step).
At first I thought the debugger was just being horrendously slow, but if you
wiggle the mouse immediately after stepping, or while clicking on the step
button, it gets processed quickly.
