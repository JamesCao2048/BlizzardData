[SWT OS X Cocoa] Eclipse causes WindowServer to consume memory
I've only started noticing this recently (possible 3.6 but definitely 3.7). I'm running the latest version of SL. I only use the 64bit Cocoa version, so I'm not sure if the 32 bit version has a similar issue.
During general Java development (refactoring, editing, building, etc.) the Mac OS X WindowServer memory usage increases until it consumes large amounts of real memory. Prior to launching Eclipse, it uses about 90MB. After an hour or so, it has consumed over 1GB of real memory at which point my system is pretty much unusable (I only have 3GB).
The Quartz Debug Window List shows in excess of 150 windows have been created by Eclipse. Most of these appear to be tooltip popups and context menus (some are just blank rectangles) that were displayed at some point. Since WindowServer is responsible for handling the interaction with the graphics hardware, it appears that the UI is creating Cocoa objects that are not getting released, or something similar.
Please let me know if there is any other debugging information I can provide.
