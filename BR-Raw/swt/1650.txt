Owner draw: gc in paint doesn't have foreground color set

Not sure of this is a bug:
Have a look the attached example that is a SWT-only example of the code that we use in the StyledCellLabelProvider
- owner draw in a table
- only paint is implemented, erase is left to the OS
In main, we set new fore- and background colors on the table widget:
Background: Yellow, Foreground: Blue
When running, you see only the background color is red. Foreground still black (OS: default)
When debugging 'paint()' the following can be observed:
- event.item has the new colors set
- event.gc has only the new background set
The current example code assumes that the gc colors are correct and paints on the gc.
Alternative is to take the colors from the item (see commented out code). This works. However it looks strange as we only do this for the non-selected items.
if (!isSelected) {
Color foreground= item.getForeground(event.index);
gc.setForeground(foreground);

Color background= item.getBackground(event.index);
gc.setBackground(background);
}
Question: Is it a bug that the gc has only the background color set? Shouldn't we be able to assume that it correctly initialized with fore and background colors.
Same with the font: The GC doesn't have the font set, the items do.
