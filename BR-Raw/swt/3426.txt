[EditorMgmt] Editor close button
I20040309
The multiple editor tab preference is diabled. In this build the editor tab is
no longer presented as a tab which makes it look a bit nicer.
Major issue:
The close button is still a moving target and now even more difficult to spot
as there is no tab border.
-> The close button should always be at the same position.
