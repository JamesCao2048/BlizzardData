JAWS reads the parent window for dialog shells
JAWS has a feature that allows you to read the contents of a message box. If a
message box pops you can hit Ins+B and it will read all of the widgets in the
box.
In the Eclipse UI MessageBox (a window with a modal shell) this feature will
read the contents of the window parenting the dialog rather than the dialog.
In other applications (like the Word Detect and Repair dialog) this will read
all of the widgets in the dialog.
