setSelection(allItems) not working on GTK
Eclipse 20030129
GTK 2.0.2
Open two or more editors, then open the editor dropdown (ctrl-shift-w).  Now
right click on the dropdown and select 'select all'.  Note only the first file
is selected.
Verified using stable M4 build that this functionality worked, and the code
calling setSelection(allItems) (org.eclipse.ui.workbench
editorList#SelectionAction#run) has not changed.
Only an issue on GTK.
Have not verified on GTK 2.0.6, need to update my linux machine.
