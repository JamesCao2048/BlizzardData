Patch for saving animated GIFs
Despite the documentation, the save() method of the ImageLoader class can't
create an animated GIF file from an ImageData array.
This is because the FileFormat class only uses the first ImageData object when
its save() method is invoked.  There's even a comment to this effect: "We do
not currently support writing multi-image files, so we use the first
image in the loader's array."
I have written my own (functional) application for converting ImageData arrays
to animated GIFs.  I would like to contribute to Eclipse by modifying the
FileFormat class to support animation.  To whom should I send the code?
Sincerely,
Matt Scarpino
