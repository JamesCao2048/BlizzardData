Build ID: M20070921-1145
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Run CustomControlExample on linux gtk
2. CTabFolderTab
3. Horizontal/Vertical Fill yes
4. click on the CTabItems text "CTabItem Content: 0", see the huge Cursor (three letters width)
More information:
I think the Cursors size should be depending on the used Font. But here it seems to depend on the lines height?
Interesting is also, if you play with the controls size, 10x10 make a real mini cursor.
I use Ubuntu 7.10, GTK 2.12
