Created  attachment 127887   [details]
Browser flickering in action
Build ID: SWT-N20090305-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Embed the browser in a Canvas.
2.Launch the application with sun.awt.noerasebackground set to true.
3.Print the control now and then: it flickers.
More information:
It seems that Control.printWidget(in, int, GC), line 2067 causes the flickering:
SetWindowPos (hwnd, hwndInsertAfter, rect1.left, ...
If I replace it with this line, the flickering goes away:
setRedraw(false);
SetWindowPos (hwnd, hwndInsertAfter, rect1.left, ...
setRedraw(true);
