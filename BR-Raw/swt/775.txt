unsetting background image inheritance does not update
3.3RC1
- run the ControlExample, stay on the Button tab
- check the Background Image checkbox
- use the combo above this checkbox to change the Background Mode on Parent to SWT.INHERIT_FORCE
-> the buttons and their parent composite now inheirit the parent's background image
- change the combo back to its original SWT.INHERIT_NONE value
-> the buttons and their parent composite still appear to show the parent's background image
- uncheck the Background Image checkbox
-> the background image disappears from the top-level composite, but still appears on the buttons and their parent
- damage and re-expose the area with the example buttons
-> now the background image goes away from the damaged region
