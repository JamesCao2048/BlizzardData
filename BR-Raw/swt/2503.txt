Spinner generates bogus ModifyText events
Spinner class generates lots of ModifyText events.
This is happening on Windows XP.
These event are generated when either Spinner widget loses focus, or Eclipse window loses focus (another app becomes active).
Below is a snippet from stack trace.
MyClass.modifyText( ModifyEvent event )
....
Spinner.setSelection(int, boolean, boolean, boolean) line: 948
Spinner.wmKillFocus(int, int, int) line: 1246
....
