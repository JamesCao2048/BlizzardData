Drag source image effect does not appear on OSX
Build ID: 3.3M5
Reporting this problem for Nicolas Richeton:
I made some tests with the new Custom DragSourceEffect of SWT 3.3M5 on OSX.
( https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=142947 )
While
public void dragStart(DragSourceEvent event) {
event.image = display.getSystemImage(SWT.ICON_WARNING)
}
is working as expected, I was unable to make the D&D effect work with any other image.
- If I use any image that is already in memory, there is no drag feedback.
- If i create a new Image during the dragStart event, the creation seems to fail : (image size is -1,-1).
Has anyone used the Drag source effect successfully ?
