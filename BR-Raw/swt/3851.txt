Can't drop views over some widgets
Build GM5
- Linux/GTK
The GTK build of Eclipse does not seem to let you drop a view over top of a
scroll bar or a table header.
1) Start a fresh copy of Eclipse.
2) From the resource perspective, drag the outline view over the Tasks view.
- Notice that when the mouse cursor is over the header for the table in the
tasks view, the no drop cursor is shown.
Dropping the Outline view at this point
will not reposition the view.
3) If the navigator view does not have a horizontal scroll bar, create a project
with a very long name so that the navigator does show a scroll bar.
4) Drag the outline view from on top of the tasks view to the bottom of the
navigator view.
- Notice that when the mouse cursor is over the horizontal scroll bar, the no
drop cursor is shown.
- Notice also that the space on the screen where the dock below cursor is very
small.
- Notice that even when the Dock below cursor is being shown that dropping the
view does not always reposition the view.
This is not the behaviour that I have seen when using Motif, or when on Windows.
