Need STATE_SYSTEM_LINKED mapped to one of the states in ACC.
I need to enable the F1 infopops for being readable by JAWS, and currently one
cannot read the "hyperlinks" in the infopop without tabbing to each one of them.
To enable the above I need to have STATE_SYSTEM_LINKED mapped to one of the
states in ACC.
