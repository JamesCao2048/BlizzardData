It's happening because showing the popup menu does not send a FocusOut to the
Tree, so it does not remove its focus rectangle.  However it has lost focus, so
later when it goes to repaint, it doesn't complete the bitten parts of the
focus rectangle because isFocus() answers false.  SSQ says that the lack of
FocusOut event is by design, but may not be needed anymore; to discuss with SN.
