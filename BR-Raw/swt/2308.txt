[Drag & Drop] DnD auto-scroll support in StyledText is too slow
3.2 RC2
The DnD auto-scroll support is scrolling horizontally char by char which is unusable slow, e.g.
have a line with 200 chars and then try to drop at the end of that line.
I filed bug for that.
Vertical scrolling could also be faster.
