javadoc console output: hyperlink not clickable, no hand cursor [javadoc]
I20040518-gtk, m9 test pass
1.Create the smoke test junit project
2.Choose Project
-> Generate Javadoc
3.Open the console and go to the line that says:
/opt/eclipse/workspaces/smoke/JUnit/junit/runner/TestCollector.java:11: warning
- Tag @see: Class or Package not found: TestSelector
4.Hover over the first part of the line
expected: see a hand cursor, clicking the link brings up the respective location
actual: the cursor flashes a little, but no hand cursor visible, clicking has no
effect
Note that selecting the line, then choose "Open Link" from the context menu does
work.
Somehow, the cursor thing seems not to work
- something seems to race,
thus the cursor flashing.
