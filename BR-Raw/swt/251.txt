segments offset should be more flexible
Currently segments offset in SegmentEvent requires the first element to always be zero. This restriction has no technical reason (just historic) and even if it did it is something that it is to handle in the implementation. No reason to have this in the API.
this restriction is annoying for developer using the new bidi toolkit with StyledText, see  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=230854#c197
