BIDI: The C/ C++ editor doesn't preserve the keyboard language after pressing sapce bar
Tested using Win 2003 Arabic locale, build M8.
1) Create a new C++ project
2) Insert a new C++ class
3) Change the keyboard language to Arabic and write an Arabic word, then a space
The keyboard language switched back to English
