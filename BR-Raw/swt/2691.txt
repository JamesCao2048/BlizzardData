CTabFolder tooltips are not read out
M6
gnopernicus is not reading out CTabFolder tooltips properly because they're
faked.
It simply says "Hide/Restore window".
Tried:
- adding accessible listeners to the tip shell and its contained label
- removing ON_TOP from tip shell creation
- giving focus to contained label when shown
