DragImage looks bad on vista (table+tree)

patch
Version: 3.4.0
Build id: I20080522-0800
The text of the drag image for table and tree look ugly on vista, this happens cause the keycolor is black (actually we don't set when we create SHDRAGIMAGE, zero=black) that it conflicts with Text anti-aliasing.
We can improve that by using a colorkey less likely to happen in the image (black is very likely, on vista foreground text selection is black).
getBackgroundPixel() is also bad cause it is white, and on xp foreground text selection is white.
In the patch attached I used red.
We also need to fill the image with the keycolor before drawing anything.
Tested on vista and xp.
