[SWT_AWT] SWT interfers with application menu
Build Identifier: 3.6M6
An AWT/Swing user interface may or may not decide to use the screen menu bar.
The various configuration tweaks are:
1.Setting the "apple.laf.useScreenMenuBar" system property to "true".
2.Setting the "com.apple.mrj.application.apple.menu.about.name" system property to whatever name.
3.Invoking "com.apple.eawt.Application.getApplication().addApplicationListener(listener)" to hook to the various application menu items.
4.com.apple.eawt.Application.getApplication().setEnabledPreferencesMenu(true);
Adding an SWT control must not interfer with the menus that appear in that bar, which is not the case currently.
This is a showstopper for some of my users.
SWT should detect that AWT is in the picture and not touch the application menu.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create an AWT/Swing application.
2.Configures the application menu bar through Mac-specific system properties and APIs.
3.Embed an SWT control
=> menus are not the ones expected.
