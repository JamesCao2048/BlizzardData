BlockSelection: Arrow_Left and Arrow_Right should set caret to beginning/end of selection
I20090514-2000
In a StyledText, have a block selection.
Arrow_Left and Arrow_Right should set the caret to the beginning/end of the selection, like in normal selection mode (regardless of where inside the selection the caret is).
- Example:
.......
..ABC..
..XYZ..
.......
- Select this block by dragging from upper-left to lower-right:
ABC
XYZ
a) Press Arrow_Left
Expected: Caret at left of A
Was: Caret at left of Z
b) Press Arrow_Right
Expected: Caret at right of Z
Was: Caret at right of 'XYZ.'
