[SWT_AWT] Removing the AWT Canvas generates a Gtk-CRITICAL message
Created  attachment 94602   [details]
A Canvas that gets removed
Build ID: 3.4M6
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create an embedded Shell on an AWT Canvas
2. Remove the Shell from its parent (which disposes the associated native resources)
3. See the following message printed in the console
(SWT:9436): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_window_group_remove_window: assertion `window->group == window_group' failed
Note that the number in "SWT:XXXX" changed at every run.
More information:
This did not occur until a few days ago. I use an Ubuntu 7.10 installation on which I accept all the automatic upgrades. Maybe a library has changed.
This is problematic because users will panic when they will start to see this message in their logs.
