Custom Table font is not applied to first column header
If a Table has a visible header, a custom font, and multiple columns, then the
first column's header uses the default system font rather than the custom font.

I've reproduced this both in my own application and in a simple test case I
created (which I can attach if it would be helpful).


Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a custom Font.

2. Create a Table.

3. Make the Table's header visible and set its font to the custom font.

4. Add multiple columns to the Table.


Actual results: The first column in the header uses the default system font,
and all the others use the custom font.

Expected results: All columns in the header use the custom font.


I'm using SWT/GTK 3.1M7. I think this is platform-specific, since I don't
remember this bug occurring in Windows; but I'll have to check to make sure.
