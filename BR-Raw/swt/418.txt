[SWT][Browser][Mozilla] memory leak in embeded mozilla browser widget
Build Identifier: 3.6
The Browser widget created with SWT.MOZILLA has big memory leak issue in below scenario: reload the page every 5 secondes and keep moving the mouse over the page.
The memory goes from 90MB to 300MB in about 7 minutes, then the RCP application crashes.
The Java heap size of the RCP application is very stable, so the leak must happen in Native code.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
A test application is attached, reproduce this issue with below steps:
1) Import XULRunnerTest.zip into Eclipse
2) Run xulrunnertest.Snippet267 with VM argument: -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath="your_xulrunner_path", I'm using XULRunner 1.9.2
3) The Yahoo home page will be refreshed every 5 seconds automatically.
4) Open Task Manager in XP to mornitor the memory usage of the RCP application.
5) Keeping moving the mouse over the Yahoo page.
6) You will see the memory keeps growing quickly
The memory usage for this RCP is very stable if no mouse moving over the Yahoo home page.
