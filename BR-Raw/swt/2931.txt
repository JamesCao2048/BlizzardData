[consistency] TreeEvent fired upon disposal of TreeItems
Either calling dispose() on a TreeItem or removeAll() on the Tree results in
TreeEvents being fired.
That happens in case the disposed TreeItem was expanded
and contained children.
Mac seems to collapse all expanded TreeItems at first
before proceeding with the disposal.
This is not happening on Windows, and I dont think its happening on Linux GTK or
Solaris Motif either.
