[painting] Ctrl+End brings StyledText into strange state
In Text Editor or Java Editor typing CTRL+PAGEUP and CTRL+PAGEDOWN creates left
margin if last line is longer than visible editor width and text is longer
(vertically) than visible editor area.
Workaround: Positioning on last character in last line and typing any key but
ARROW UP removes this extra margin.
It is reproducable always.
