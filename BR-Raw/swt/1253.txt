Build ID: I20081104-0916
Steps To Reproduce:
1.open a file in the navigator
2.ensure focus in the file content
3.move mouse into editor window
4.press cmd-option-w.
expected: On Mac OS X swt carbon, this would bring up the "show in..." context menu
actual: nothing.
More information:
same applies for the other context menus with keybindings (refactor, source)
in the outline view, the menus do appear (if the view has focus).
