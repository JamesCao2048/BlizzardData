ToolItem with image is blank or shows cheese
3.1 RC1
- check the "Always run in background" preference
- show the Progress view
- kick off some long-running operation (e.g.
Project > Clean)
- in the Progress view, the cancel button for this Job is blank
- resize the window while the job is still going
- the button is not redrawn properly, i.e.
it shows cheese from what was in that screen rectangle before
Also saw this in the progress dialog on shutdown.
This uses a ToolItem with image set.
The image changes depending on the state of the job.
See code in NewProgressViewer.JobItem's constructor.
