Icon in Windows taskbar incorrect
20020521 XP
1. Run eclipse from within eclipse.
2. Note the window icon in the runtime workbench is correct but occasionally
its icon in the windows taskbar is incorrect (its just the default windows
icon)
3. Changing perspectives in the runtime workbench changes the icon to be
correct (changing perspectives updates the window title but not the icon as
far as I know).
I don't know why this happens sometimes and not others but it seems to happen
at least 20% of the time I launch.
