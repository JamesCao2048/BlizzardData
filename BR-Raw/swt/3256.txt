[Import/Export] Import/Export dialogs confused by "Select Types...
The checkboxes beside the items in the directory tree (left hand pane) are not updated properly when
"Select Types..." is used to filter out some of the files to export. To see this, select a project, bring up
the Export dialog, use "Select Types..." to filter out some of the files being exported. At this point, the
checkmark at the root of the directory hierarchy should be marked "grayed" to indicate partial selection.
Instead it is still showing as "checked" to indicate full selection.
Same for Import.
