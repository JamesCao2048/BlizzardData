g_object_get() emits console warnings in ToolItem#gtk_create_menu_proxy
Build Identifier: I20120502-1800
Need to fix the console warnings being emitted by g_object_get() while trying to retrieve the value of property setting "gtk-menu-images" in ToolItem#gtk_create_menu_proxy(). The warning message that appears is:
(SWT:17023): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: g_object_get_valist: object class
`GtkSettings' has no property named `gtk-menu-images'
Reproducible: Always
