[browser]browser.execute() fails when Acrobat Reader v7 is displayed in browser
I have a pdf document which I am displaying in the browser. Then, to print the
contents of the browser I do
browser.execute("window.print()");
The above works fine for Acrobat Reader v5, but throws a NullPointerException
for Acrobat Reader v7. After debugging, I found that it cannot find the value
of "parentWindow" for some reason. Therefore, not only printing, but ANY
javascript passed in to execute method will throw a NullPointerException.
Thanx,
- Kalman
