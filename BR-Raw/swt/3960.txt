Clipboard copy/paste is cut/paste on Windows 98
build 20020827
-Fix the attached test case to point to a test file in the file system
-Run the test case
-Go to the Windows explorer and select paste in the context menu to paste the
file on the clipboard to the selected folder (not the source folder)
On Windows NT and Windows 2000 the file is copied from the source location.
On
Windows 98 the file is moved.
In Eclipse this results in resources being *moved* from the workspace when the
user selects copy/paste or Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V to copy a file to the file system.
The
workspace is out of sync because it does not know about the move.
It is
assuming the clipboard transfer is a copy.
See  bug 22566 .
Is there anything Eclipse can do/needs to do to make sure the clipboard
transfer is a copy on Windows 98?
