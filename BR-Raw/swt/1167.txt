Generator tool needs to recognize when bridgesupport.extras files are out of sync
Changes made to bridgesupport.extras files outside of the Mac Generator UI are lost if the Mac Generator view is open while updating.
To reproduce someone else has to make a change to the .extras files in CVS, and then you need to merge those changes into your workspace.
1.Open the Mac Generator view and pick any class.
Select a few methods to be generated, and click the 'Generate' button.
2.Switch to Team Synchronizing.
Choose the bridgesupport.extra file you just generated.
Now, update to the latest version, which should merge in the changes from CVS.
3.Go back to the Mac Generator and find a method that was added in the update.
--> The checkbox for that method isn't selected.
The reverse is true for methods that were removed in the update.
4.Now, click Generate again.
--> OS.java no longer has the methods and selectors you just added, which usually means a bunch of build errors.
The Mac Generator view should either watch for a 'resource out of sync with system' like a text or Java editor, or provide a UI to re-read the .extras file and update its UI.
