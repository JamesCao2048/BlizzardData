Ctrl+F1 works only on some fields in the help search
OS: Linux - GTK
Build: RC2 with IBMJava2-131 JRE
Steps to reproduce:
1.  Launch eclipse with DBCS locale.
2.  Select from the menu bar Search -> Help
3.  When the window pops up, click on the first text field and press ctrl+F1.
Expected Result:
A help pop up screen should come up displaying information about the Help
Search.
Execution result:
Nothing Happens
Comments:
1.  This occurs on all DBCS languages.
2.  This event only happens in the first text field.  When cycling through all
the other fields using the tab key, the ctrl+F1 functions properly by
displaying the correct text.
3.  The attachment will show exactly which field is not responding to the
ctrl+F1, for it is circled in red.  The fields circled in green work properly.
