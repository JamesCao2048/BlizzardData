Please make FormAttachment() public
This is kind of an esoteric use-case, but making FormAttachment public would
make it possible to write more readable XSWT code.
For example, due to the package private contructor, we currently must write the
following:
<text x:id="secondCol" text="Second column">
<layoutData x:class="formData">
<left x:p0="firstColLabel" offset="10"/>
<top x:p0="firstColLabel" offset="0" alignment="TOP"/>
<right x:p0="90"/>
</layoutData>
</text>
(the x:p0 is a meta-tag for specifying constructor arguments)
If a 0-arg constructor were public, we could instead write:
<text x:id="secondCol" text="Second column">
<layoutData x:class="formData">
<left control="firstColLabel" offset="10"/>
<top control="firstColLabel" offset="0" alignment="TOP"/>
<right numerator="90"/>
</layoutData>
</text>
which is much more readable/understandable without looking hard at it first.
