Twistie in Tree does not give feedback on mouseDown with DragDetect listener
I20090311-1800, cocoa
As soon as a DragDetect listener is installed on a Tree, the collapse/expand twisties don't give feedback any more on mouseDown. Without the DragDetect listener, the triangle gets darker while the mouse is down inside it.
Could be related to the problem with Tree#getItem(Point) from  bug 268303  (I don't think a drag should be started on the twistie).
