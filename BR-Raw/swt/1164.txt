[misc] No object:text-changed:insert events fired for method completion (and others)
In the code editor, whenever Eclipse performs automatic insertion like
matching parenthesis or method completion, accessibility infrastructure only
sees object:text-caret-moved but no object:text-changed:insert
which leaves the idea of the on screen text inside an assistive technology like
a screen reader out of sync with reality.
I observe this on Linux with GTK + AT-SPI.
To reproduce, simply invoke Ctrl+SPACE in a situation where only one possible
completion is valid.
The newly inserted text appears on screen, but
eclipse does not fire any object:text-changed:insert events via
ATK.
Use accerciser for a quick inspection tool.
