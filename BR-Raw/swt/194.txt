Remove qt from org.eclipse.swt
The QT port has been moved over to Eclipse Labs:  http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/swtqt/
For background, see  Bug 318484
- SWT/Qt code donation discussion.
We need to delete the qt subfolders that were initially committed to org.eclipse.swt.
I believe that so far, there are only 3 subfolders:
org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT/qt
org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT Drag and Drop/qt
org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT Browser/qt
