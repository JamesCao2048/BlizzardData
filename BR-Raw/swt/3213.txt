MS Word can not be pasted on clipboard in Windows 98
Build ID: 20031119-2030
While I was testing eclipse using the clipboard examples, I noticed that MS
Word document can not be pasted properly on clipboard.
Every time I copied one
line of word document, and pasted onto the clipboard, only the first character
was pasted.
However I can copy text from notepad and paste on clipboard.
This problem only
occurs on windows 98.On Windows XP, I can paste Word on clipboard.
