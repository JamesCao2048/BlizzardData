* it is not possible to select files with extensions that contain more than one point, if this extension is set via setFilterExtensions() for the FileDialog
- therefore files of the desired type cannot be opened
* works fine on windows
* see attached screenshot
- the .profile.xml files are not selectable
Reproducible: Always
