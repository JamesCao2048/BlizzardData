Eclipse loses keyboard shortcuts on OSX
Beginning (I think) with 3.2 M5, Eclipse seems to lose the keyboard shortcut keys in some instances.
I have yet to determine how exactly that happens, but from what I see, it has to do with switching to Eclipse from other applications.
This means that the markers for the keys in the main menu and context menues are gone, and pressing the shortcut keys like cmd-C and cmd-V does nothing.
As you can imagine, it's a pain to not being able to copy and paste...
Deselecting the center content area and again switching from and to Eclipse makes the shortcuts appear again.
