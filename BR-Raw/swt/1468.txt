[consistency] Font#getFontData() not safe from non-ui thread on MacOS
This seems to have worked before in 3.3 and changed in 3.4. A call to Font#getFontData() from a non-ui thread results in a SWT exception. For one, the JavaDoc is not speced to throw this exception and second, it works fine on Windows and Linux. The call to Device#getDPI() from getFontData() calls checkDevice() and causes this issue.
