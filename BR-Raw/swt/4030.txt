Coolbar - can "lose" items when platform widget wraps
Build 20020611
1.Size the workbench and Reset Toolbar Layout so that you have two rows of
items, with only a couple of items on the second row.
2.Size the workbench smaller and smaller vertically.
When the items on the
first row can no longer fit (due to minimum size reached for all), the platform
widget will start to wrap items from row 1 to row 2.
Notice that you "lose" the original second row items.
The WorkbenchWindowLayout is being called during the resize and the size of the
coolbar recomputed, so this appears to be an SWT bug.
If you Reset Toolbar
Layout, the problem will be fixed, but that is because wrap indices are
explicitly being set.
