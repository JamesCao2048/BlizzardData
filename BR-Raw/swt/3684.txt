MessageDialog does not accept null shell
2.1
The Javadoc for MessageDialog's constructors states:
Note: Currently, null can be passed in for the parent.
...
However, this is no longer the case.  In 2.1, trying this results in an NPE.
I actually wanted this since I need to bring up a dialog on startup to notify
the user of a workspace version incompatibility.  There are no other shells
around at this point (or even a display).
Now I have to create a bogus shell just to avoid the NPE.
