Path.getPathData() returns points as integers and not floats
Build Identifier: 20100917-0705
Path.getPathData() effectively returns an array of points that are all integers. This seems strange, since it accepted a list of points specified as floats.
The problem is that the list in will not match the list out 鈥撀爏o when using Draw2D ScaledGraphics to make a larger path, it applies a transform based on the scaling factor and the list and type of points provided by PathData. The problem is most evident in xy graphs (charts) where a continuous function draws a smooth curve on the screen but a jagged one on any other device, since it's losing precision in its coordinates.
The solution is simple in theory. 'Fix' getPathData() to return a list of floats (or modify PathData or Path to provide an alternate access to a float-based list of plot points.
I can think of no workaround.
