Disposing the embedded Shell works fine on other platforms.
With the new Mac OSX Cocoa port, a null pointer exception is thrown when this Shell is disposed.
In the context of our application, this effectively makes it crash.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Embed an SWT control in a Swing/AWT application.
2.Dispose the embedded Shell based on a user action.
=> get the NPE.
