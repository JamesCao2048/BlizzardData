Patch to fix 2 accessibility problems in CTabFolder
The attached patch fixes 2 accessibility problems in the e4 CTabFolder:
1) The min, max, and chevron buttons now have accessible names.
2) The keyboard shortcut for switching pages in a CTabFolder (ctrl+PageUp) is now available to screen readers and it can be announced (supported in JAWS 12 and up).
In addition, the patch removes a few lines of code that were not being used.
