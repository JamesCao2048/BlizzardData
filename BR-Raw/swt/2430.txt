Can't size columns smaller then title
When I have a column with a long title but narrow data, I cannot make the column
smaller than the title.
You can see this in Eclipse: Open the Problems view and try to make any column
narrower than the title.
I would suggest that Eclipse allows to make a column smaller than the title and
add a tooltip when the title doesn't fit in the available space.
