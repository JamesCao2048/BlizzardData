Revert CTabItem unselected tab separator style for simple tabs
In M6 we introduced a change to the tab separator (vertical edge) style for both curvy and simple tabs, for the unselected tab case.
Previously, unselected simple tabs just drew vertical lines for their separators.
In discussing with Tod, we should revert to the 3.2 style for several reasons:
1) Those who pick simple tabs typically don't want their UI look to change
2) PDE uses simple tabs in their editors but because they don't use borders, the vertical separators with slight curve at the end looks like a bug.
