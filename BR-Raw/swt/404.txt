Tree#selectAll() should only select visible items (those without any collapsed parent)
I20110322-0800
Tree#selectAll() should only select visible items (i.e. roots and items whose parents are expanded and visible). Currently, it selects all items in the Tree, which is unexpected. The problem can be seen with Snippet61 if you add this listener and then press "A":
tree.addListener(SWT.KeyDown, new Listener() {
public void handleEvent(Event e) {
if (e.keyCode == 'a') {
e.doit= false;
System.out.println("selectAll");
tree.selectAll();
tree.notifyListeners(SWT.Selection, new Event());
}
}
});
On GTK, only visible items are selected (as expected).
This is a problem in the SDK, which calls selectAll() on Ctrl+A, so we see the wrong selections in many places. An example where this gets really weird is the tree in the Edit JRE dialog from the Installed JREs preference page: Right after opening the dialog, I can press Ctrl+A and then click Javadoc Location... . But after I've expanded and collapsed the first tree item, Ctrl+A disables the button.
