Dialog opens with no contents; resizing shows contents
I20050112-1200, Linux 2.6.9, GTK+ 2.4.9, KDE 3.3.1

When some dialogs first open, they do not paint their contents.  If the dialog
is resized, then the contents become visible.


STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
------------------
1.) Open an editor with multiple revisions.
2.) Open the CVS resource history on the editor.
3.) Select one of the revisions in the history.
4.) Open the context menu.
5.) Select "Tag with Existing..."


The dialog opens, but it is blank.  Resizing the dialog by even the slightest
amount causes it to paint its contents.  Switching virtual desktops (i.e.,
unmapping the window) does not cause it to paint.  Neither does obscuring it
with another window.
