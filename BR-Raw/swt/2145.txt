[browser] unable to copy&paste text in browser widget
It isnt possible to copy&paste text from / to browser widget. E.g. you can't select text from the shown website and copy it to another application or paste existing clipboard content into <input type="text"... or <textarea>. You can't select text from the shown website at all.
I've tried both command-c (apple-c) and the context-menu. The context-menu only gives me 2 options: back and reload but no copy or paste.
I've tested this with both 3.1.2 and 3.2M5.
