Property Sheet does not allow editing when there is only one property
Scenario:
1) Create a PDE plug-in project.
2) Switch to 'Extensions' page.
3) Create a new 'Action Set' extension.
4) Select the extension and create new menu.
5) Select the menu and create a new separator.
6) Select the separator and try to change its default name.
Property sheet refuses to allow editing of the name.
All other objects that
have more than one property can be edited as before.
This is a major problem for PDE because it makes the manifest editor useless
for all the extension elements that have only one property.
