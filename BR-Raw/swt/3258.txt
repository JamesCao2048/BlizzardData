Setting a GridLayout on a TabFolder gives strange behavior when resizing
Although it doesn't make sense to set a layout on a TabFolder, I've seen this
done many times.
The problem is that it doesn't affect the look in windows, but
in motif, the widgets appear in bits and pieces after resizing the window.
Would it make sense to override setLayout() in TabFolder as a no-op, as an
added safety mechanism, or to throw an exception?
