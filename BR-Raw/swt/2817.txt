[accessibility, consistency] Make Link and Spinner accessible on GTK
Need to get the latest GTK, ATK, and Gnopernicus first, because apparently,
the latest accessibility works much better than before.
Spinner might just work, because it's native, but it needs to be tested.
Link is emulated, so it will need to have accessibility added.
Also need to test all controls, given that accessibility is 'real' on GTK now.
