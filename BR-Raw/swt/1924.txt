Click the Display tab, and then click "Use High Contrast" and click OK.

3.Notice that the header (bar that contains text) is black, and the text is black, therefore you cannot read it's contents.
More information:
This problem is actually two problems in one.
The first issue that arises is that ExpandBar is not high contrast complient.
The second issue arises in ones inability to fix the first issue by changing the background color or font color of the header.
Both issues should perferabily be fixed.
