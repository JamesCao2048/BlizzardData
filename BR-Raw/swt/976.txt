BlockSelection: Shift+Click does not work with normal caret
I20090518-2000
StyledText in BlockSelection mode: Shift+Click does not work with the normal caret.
Instead of selecting the block from the caret to the clicked location, it just sets the virtual caret at the clicked location.
Subsequent Shift+Clicks then correctly span the selection, starting at the (new) caret location.
