Combo.setItem(int, String) does not preserve the selection index
Assume you have a combo with two items, "A" and "B", where "B" is currently
selected (i.e. getSelectionIndex() returns 1). If you then call
combo.setItem(1,"C"), the combo will be empty and getSelectionIndex will return -1.
Why does it not preserve the "selection index"?
