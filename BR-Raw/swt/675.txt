SWT Browser.refresh() does not fire ProgressEvent
I am using Eclipse 3.1 on Windows XP Pro SP2.
I have adapted the Web Browser SWT example for use in a plugin I am
developing, and noticed that the Browser.refresh() method does not fire a
ProgressEvent. However, using the native browser refresh hot key (F5) does
fire the event.
