Tree does not always fully expand in debugger
- debug any snippet that has a breakpoint that can be hit on demand (eg.- in a MouseDown listener)
- hit the breakpoint, Resume
- collapse the Tree in the Debug view, select the top item
- do whatever's needed in the snippet to make the breakpoint be hit again
-> the Tree is partially expanded but not far enough, so the frame with the breakpoint is not shown
