[Gtk] unexpected MouseExit event for Shell causes bad interaction with JFace ToolTip on 3.6
I have noticed that when I click the "i" button the displayed tooltip is often times hidden when I try to navigate to it to scroll or to press the Learn more link. Suggestion to improve interaction:
* Only hide tooltip when moving the mouse over the tooltip and out again. Do not hide if the mouse is moved over other controls but has not entered the tooltip, yet.
* Hide the tooltip on pressing ESC.
