Addition of tasks to task window is too slow
When attacking a new code base, I am likely to get up to a thousand warnings in the task window.
Eclipse adds these warnings individually, which takes a long time.
If I do a full rebuild of all projects, it will first remove, then re-add all of the warnings.
(This process can take several seconds for a large number of warnings on a TiBook 667.)
Either the table component in the MacOS X M5 release needs to be sped up dramatically, or Eclipse needs to disconnect the view from the model while tasks are added.
(That second option is based on my experience with Swing components, and so may not apply to SWT.)
