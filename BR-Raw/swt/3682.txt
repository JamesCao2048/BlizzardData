[Properties dialog] Project Properties -> Info page should not use text fields
Integration build 09/17.  Looks bad on all motif platforms.
- select a Project, right-click -> Properties
- on the subsequent Info page the read-only fields (the values for Path, Type,
etc.) are created as read-only Text fields instead of Labels.  I guess this is
so that their values can be selected and copied by the user (?)
- this looks fine on windows, but on motif these text fields all get automatic
borders, which identify them as user input targets.  Additionally, on
Solaris/AIX/HP-UX these fields have different coloured backgrounds which make
them stand out much worse
