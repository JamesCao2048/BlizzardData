When expanding tree in variables view, icon does not show expanded
1) Variables View tree must have enough elements visible so that scrolling is needed.

2) Scroll so that an unexpanded tree item is at the very bottom of the visible area.
3) Try to expand the last visible item.
4) The + icon does not change to a
- icon, but the item is expanded.
Screenshots to follow.
