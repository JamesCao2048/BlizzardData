Bug in List.showSelection method
List.showSelection method doesn't always make the selection visible. The
problem is in calculation of bottomIndex.
int bottomIndex = Math.min (topIndex + visibleCount + 1, count - 1);
has to be changed to:
int bottomIndex = Math.min (topIndex + visibleCount - 1, count - 1);
