virtual table accessibility slow on GTK (was: Open Type is very slow: causes UI lockup with high CPU utilization)
Build Identifier: Version: Juno Release Build id: 20120614-1722
Open Type is incredibly slow on my new Asus G55V laptop (2.3GHz quad core i7 with 12GB ram, 2Gb Nvidia graphics, SSD).
Performance of Open Type varies depending how many characters are entered (quickly before it locks up!).
For example:
Using a brand new workspace with a single empty project it takes about 20 seconds for Open Type to unlock itself with the string: java.lang
I've tried various vm parameters, but have settled on the following in order to demonstrate the problem eclipse.ini (-XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xms512m -Xmx512m).
Otherwise performance of the machine generally is generally excellent. Eclipse loads in a few seconds and navigation is otherwise not bad (find/search can be a bit slow to appear).
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new or existing java workspace (create a new empty project if necessary)
2. Ctrl-Shift-T or click Open Type
3. type: java.lang. or similar
4. wait 20-30 seconds
Ubuntu 12.04 x64 (3.2.0-26-generic)
Sun JDK 1.7.0_06 (x64)
Eclipse and workspace are installed on an SSD ext4 partition. I've tried moving each to a regular hdd with no effect.
