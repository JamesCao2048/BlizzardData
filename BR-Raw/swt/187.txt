[OpenGL] Closing RCP editor with GLCanvas breaks all remaining open GLCanvas
Created  attachment 219291   [details]
A workspace containing a sample RCP app displaying the GLCanvas problem
Version: Indigo Service Release 2
Build id: 20120216-1857
I use GLCanvas in my RCP app and a common workflow is to open multiple editors, each containing a GLCanvas.
In Eclipse SDK 3.7.2 and 3.8, closing an editor disables the GLCanvas in the remaining open editors.
The disabled GLCanvas appear as black canvases.
You can recover all canvases by opening a new GLCanvas-containing editor.
I confirmed that problem is not observed when the RCP app is using Eclipse SDK 3.7.1 or when using a simple SWT shell with two CFolderTabs (regardless of SWT version).
I marked this bug CRITICAL as it introduced a broken behavior into two releases.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open two or more editors containing a GLCanvas
2.Close one editor, the remaining GLCanvas editors turn black
3.Open a new GLCanvas editor, the other editors recover
In the attached workspace:
* Run the GLProblem project as an Eclipse application to launch the sample app.
Use "File | New Editor One" to open an editor containing a GLCanvas.
* Run the GLProblemMain class as a Java application to launch the SWT Shell/CFolderTab snippet.
