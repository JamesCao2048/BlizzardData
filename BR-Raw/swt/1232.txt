[Cocoa] Forms layout oddity
Build id: I20081030-1917
1.Create a new plugin project.
2.Go to "Extensions" tab.
3.Extensions list appears at bottom of part, with scroll needed to access.
I'm not sure if this is an oddity with the layout for this particular form
-- I haven't seen it any other place, but this page looks fine under Carbon.
It looks as though the preferred size is not calculating correctly and the alignment is being interpreted as bottom.
