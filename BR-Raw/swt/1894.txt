[Launcher] JVM crash on splash teardown on linux.gtk.x86
Run the attached testApplication (use the ap.product file to launch as an application).  Get a JVM crash as the splash screen is torn down.  The application does the following:
public Object start(IApplicationContext context) throws Exception {
Display display = PlatformUI.createDisplay();
display.dispose();
return IApplication.EXIT_OK;
}
Crash happens when the launcher calls g_main_context_iteration to spin the event loop to take down the splash.
Crash does not occur if Platform.endSplash() is inserted before display.dispose()
