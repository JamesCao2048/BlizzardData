[PropertiesView] Properties View scrolling problem
On OS X when the Properties view contains a scroll bar, select the first property, click the scroll bar and
drag down, when you let go of the mouse button, the view will scroll back to the top such that the
property you select is the first item in the view.  In this case, using the down arrow button to scroll
doees not work at all.
