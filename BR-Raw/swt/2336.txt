6 different methods cause pens to be constructed and selected
There are 6 different methods on GC which result in a call to setPen(), which
constructs and selects a Pen.
This does not reflect the behavior of native C
programs which would construct the proper Pen the first time, without
intermediate, unused Pens.
GC should only construct Pens which are actually needed, tracking the
intermediate state locally until pen creation occurs.
I haven't benchmarked anything yet, so I'd be willing to run some profiling of
extpen creation overhead.
An alternative is to add some setAll() method which
takes all paremeters at once.
