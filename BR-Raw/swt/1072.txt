Eclipse crashes when trying to print code with a scale different from 100%.
Build ID: I20090313-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open a java source file.
2. Select print.
3. In the print dialog that comes up, enter 80 in the scale field.
4. Click print.
Results:
Eclipse crashes.
Reproducible:
Always.
More information:
Probably Mac specific.  The print dialog that comes up looks more like a 10.4 (Tiger) dialog than a 10.5 (Leopard) dialog. Maybe eclipse calls the wrong api function?
Another curious side remark: When the dialog comes up, the scale is set to '100 %' (with an added %-sign). As soon as you try to enter anything, an input validator only lets you enter numbers without the %-sign. I cannot tell if this is related or a separate cosmetic issue.
