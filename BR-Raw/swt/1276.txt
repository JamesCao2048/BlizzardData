Clicking on a SWT.CASCADE MenuItem dismisses the menu
I20081202-1812, Cocoa
When I click on a menu item with a submenu, the whole menu (menu bar and context menu) closes.
Hovering over it opens the submenu as expected.
In other apps (how can I tell the difference between Carbon and Cocoa apps?), clicking on a menu item with a submenu keeps the menu open.
