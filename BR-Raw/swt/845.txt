[Widgets] Black screen in windows 7 aero mode using Tracker
Hi,
I didn't want to open a ticket with a Major severity, but this one is pretty bad.  I'm not sure if this is happening on Vista aero mode as well, but it is definitely happening consistently on Windows 7 aero mode.
We have an SWT app (currently running SWT 3.4 on windows 7.  SWT 3.5 has the same problem).  The application is kind of like a graphical editor.  I'm using a Tracker object to place an object on the screen after selecting the object they want to place.  So, after they hit OK on a dialog, I create the tracker on the composite, and have it draw a rectangle a certain size as they move the mouse.  When they click on the composite, the tracker ends, and I place the object on the screen at that location.
When the code calls tracker.open(), the whole screen turns black.  I can still see the mouse cursor, but the screen is entirely black.  Once I click on the composite, and the tracker.open() returns, the screen returns to its normal view.
My code is pretty simple...
Tracker tracker = new Tracker(compositeClientArea, SWT.NONE);
tracker.setStippled(true);
tracker.setCursor(BaseView.getMoveCursor());
//scale image width/height based on zoom mode
zoomPointTemp.x = width;
zoomPointTemp.y = height;
ImageRotationCache.zoomImageSize(zoomPointTemp, getZoomableAdapter().getZoomLevel());

//set starting rectangle
Rectangle rectStart = new Rectangle(0, 0, zoomPointTemp.x, zoomPointTemp.y);
final Rectangle[] rects = new Rectangle[1];
rects[0] = rectStart;
tracker.setRectangles(rects);
tracker.addListener(SWT.Move, new Listener()
{
...
}
if (!tracker.open())
....

When I switch to windows 7 basic mode, everything works fine.
Also of note, I have 2 monitors on my development machine.  This is kind of the wierd part.  If I move the app to the second monitor, and initiate the tracker, the main primary monitor still turns black, but the second monitor shows the app fine, and I can see the whole operation.  Not sure if this is related to two monitors or not...
Any ideas what's going on?
Thanks,
Joe
