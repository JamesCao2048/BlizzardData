Accessibility problems
20020326, Win2K
When I launch the Help view, the tab key does not actually do anything.
I need
to first click on one of the "live" areas before it starts working (eg.
the
banner with the tool buttons, the nav frame or the content frame.
We should be
starting the Help view in a way that can be immediately navigated via the
keyboard.
