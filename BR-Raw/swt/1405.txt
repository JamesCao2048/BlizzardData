Last character of the line disappears when selecting code at the end of line
Using I20081014-1600, I had a weird display problem in the java editor.
1) I have an editor with this contents:
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
String s = args[0];<< SELECT FROM HERE
TO HERE>>System.out.println(s);
}
}
2) Select the portion between << and >>.
3) When doing this, the semi-colon at the end of String s = args[0]; is displayed in white :-)
4) Since my editor background is white, it looks like it disappeared.
