Link widget does not handle single quote (') for href attribute
I20090421-0930
The Link widget does not handle single quotes (') for href attributes.
In the ControlExample, when I set this text:
Visit the <A HREF='www.eclipse.org'>Eclipse.org</A> project
, the widget only shows:
Visit the <A
Since HTML attributes can be surrounded by ' or ", either the widget should should support both, or the Javadoc of setText(..) should tell that only " is supported.
