Text.getCaretLineNumber() differs between Windows and Linux
Build ID: M20080221-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Run attached test case on linux (I used redhat linux 5)
2. Click in text box - label displays "Caret line number is: 1"
3. Run same test case on windows: Label displays "Caret line number is: 0"
More information:
I would expect the line number to be 0 in both cases (as most positioning in Java is 0 based).
