Snippet345 is using the wrong example text.
Snippet345 uses the example test, "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy brown dog."
This is, of course, totally wrong.
The example text in question has traditionally been used because it's a semi-short sentence and contains all letters of the English alphabet.  Except I don't see the letter 'S' in there.  Do you see an 'S'?  I don't see an 'S'.
Also, the word brown is written twice--this is wasteful duplication and should be refactored.
The example text should be:
"The quick brown fox *jumps* over the lazy dog."

Now you know.  And knowing is half the battle.
P.S. In case it's not clear to anybody, the sarcastic tone is meant as a joke.  Carry on.
