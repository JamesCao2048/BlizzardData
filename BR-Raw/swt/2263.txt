Unable to open external Safari browser
I20060919-0010
Help isn't working on this build because it can't seem to launch an external Safari.
On the mac, Help only exists in an external browser, it doesn't encase an embedded browser in a Shell like on windows and linux.
The following SWT app runs on 3.3 M1 but not on the M2 candidate.
-------------
import org.eclipse.swt.program.Program;
public class BrowserTest {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Program program = Program.findProgram("html"); //$NON-NLS-1$
program.execute(" http://www.google.com ");
}
}
--------------
It does find Safari, just can't seem to open it.
Critical because help doesn't work on the mac because of this.
Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong.
