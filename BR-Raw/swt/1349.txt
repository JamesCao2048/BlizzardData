[Mac] Application menu hook example needed
Need a code sample/snippet that implements the equivalent "application menu hook" from carbon.
This allows the SWT application to behave more like a native OS X application.

In RCP/carbon the workbench has something called CarbonUIEnhancer.java
- the same thing will be needed for cocoa.
That file contains a good example of a SWT/carbon application menu hook for SWT/carbon.
