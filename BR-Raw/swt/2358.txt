[Browser] JavaDoc Hover/Browser-Widget doesn`t show Text
In Version 3.1.2 the JavaDocHover works, but if I press F2 I see an empty white page. Now I swiched to 3.2RC4 an the JavadocHover shows an empty white page, too (without pressing F2). I use the same Workspace, Project and JDK 1.5.0_06.
After some research, I notice that the Browser-Widget is the problem.
I changed the methode JavadocHover.getHoverControlCreator():
...
new AbstractReusableInformationControlCreator() {
...
doCreateInformationControl(Shell parent){
return new DefaultInformationControl(...);
}
So, now I have the same behavior as in 3.1.2.

I try Snippet136 (render HTML from memory) from the SWT-Snippet page to figure out whats wrong.
The result from the Snippet was the same, an empty page (<HTML></HTML>)
I change the default browser setting from WinXP to my Firefox-Browser, but this does not work. The Browser-Widget use the IE.
Maybe its a SecuritySeeting thing from IE. I use the IE with the newest Patches.
Any idea? How can I change the default Browser to FireFox?
