StyledText - replace getXAtOffset(caretOffset) with caret.getLocation().x
build 20020319
In a number of places we get the location of the caret by calling getXAtOffset
(caretOffset).
I haven't looked at the code but we may be able to replace this with a call to
caret.getLocation().x. This won't be possible though if the caret is null
(i.e., when there is no caret). We could at least optimize the case when there
is a caret.
