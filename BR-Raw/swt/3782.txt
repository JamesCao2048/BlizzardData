Mouse pointer does not change in table header
RC2
- open the task list
- move the mouse pointer in the table header at the gap between two columns
-> the mouse pointer does not give any feedback that the columns can be resized, this
only happens when pressing the mouse button.
Other Mac apps give that feedback, e.g.,
iTunes.
