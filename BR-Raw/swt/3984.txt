StyledText does not support setting selection with caret on the left
Build 2.0 release
The public API for StyledText does not allow the selection to be changed so that
the caret is on the left side of the selection.
The setSelection methods do not
allow any way to specify a cursor on the left side (start > end, pass in a
direction, length
< 0) and setCaretOffset clears the selection.
StyledText does support selections with the caret on the left side (see
doSelection).
However, the API necessary to use the support does not appear to
be public.
