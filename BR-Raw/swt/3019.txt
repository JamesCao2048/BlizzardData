Views keep resizing after mouse up
3.0-RC3
Bug 67458  makes fast view resizing fast on Linux-GTK+.  However, if you open a
fast view and resize it big and small really quickly, mouse up sometimes fails
to stop the drag.
1. Open a fast view.
2. Resize it big and small really quickly.
3. Let go of the mouse, keep going back and forth to keep generating motion events.
4. Notice that the fast view keeps resizing.
I think this is a bug in Sash, or in the code to handle the motion hints.
