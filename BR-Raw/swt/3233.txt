investigate making emulated Table and Tree always post selections
post-3.0
Compare event ordering to other platforms, as there are some inconsistencies in
the implementation that probably introduce some problems.  Senders of Selection

examples:
- SelectableItemWidget.deselectNotify currently async's
- Tree.mouseDoubleClick currently sends (notifyListeners)
