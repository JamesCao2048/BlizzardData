Program#execute(String) broken for file:/ arguments containing #
I20110310-1119 Cocoa
Program#execute(String) is broken for file:/ arguments containing #.
When I generate Javadoc and then want to open the Javadoc of a method selected in the editor in the system browser, then # is wrongly escaped before the argument is passed to the browser (resulting in an URL with %23, which is wrong).
Example:
String urlText = "file:/Users/mk/Documents/runtime-New_configuration/javaP/doc/p/A.html#foo()";
Program program = Program.findProgram("html");
program.execute(urlText);
The problems is in org.eclipse.swt.program.Program.getURL(String).
If I add
|| lowercaseName.startsWith ("file:/")
to the condition, then it works.
And I can still open files with interesting names like "a,b#&c   [%23].html".
