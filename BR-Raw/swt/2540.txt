TabFolder no longer sets focus to tab when mnemonic pressed
I20041208-1200. This worked as expected up to at least I200411170800.
TabFolder no longer sets focus to tab when the frontmost tab's mnemonic is
pressed. Steps:
public class C {
void method(Object o) {}
}
- set caret into "method"
- Refactor > Change Method Signature
- press Alt+R
=> Expected: parameters list gets focus
=> Was: nothing happens
This is also easily reproducable with the ControlExample (must first set
mnemonics for Tab 0, Tab 1, and Tab 2).
