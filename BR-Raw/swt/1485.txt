SWT Snippet
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Run Attached Snippet in 3.4
2. Drag the contents of the first (and only) Tree-Cell
3. Notice the x-coordinates output in the Console (up to about 370) to be higher than the actual column-width (200) and shell-width(300)
4. Do The same in 3.3: Realistic values will be output.
More information:
I asked this on the swt-newsgroup, but no response.
(As a sidenote, there is another difference: in 3.4, a Drag-Image is shown, in 3.3 there is none. I would prefer to have none.)
