Table doesn't send selection change events anymore when selecting elements with the mouse
Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20051031-2000
In Open Type dialog when Show Status Line is enabled then the status line entry
does change if one goes through the entries by pressing up/down key but not if
an entry is selected with the mouse.
