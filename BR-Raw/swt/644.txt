Regression on SWT Cocoa Table header between 3.6M4 and 3.6M5
With SWT Cocoa 3.6M4, the Snippet 311 (show a menu in a table header) works correctly.
However, with SWT Cocoa 3.6M5 and later, right clicking on the table header brings up the tableMenu rather than the headerMenu.  Something in the calculation of where the click occurred (header vs table) has regressed in 3.6M5. Right clicking in the first row of the table, brings up the headerMenu, however.  So my guess is that it has something to do with the Table#getClientArea method.
Note that both Table and Tree exhibit this problem. I ran this using the 64bit cocoa versions.
Let me know if I can help provide more info.
