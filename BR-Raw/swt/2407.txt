Scrollbars not excluded from client area
Run Snippet9. Make the shell smaller.
On Windows, the scrollbars become active as soon as you touch the edge of the composite and you are able to scroll to see the full oval.
On Mac OS X (tried both Panther and Tiger) you can't see the very edge of the oval when scrolling and the scrollbars do not become active until part of the oval is missing.
I think the scrollbars are not being subtracted from the client area of the shell.
