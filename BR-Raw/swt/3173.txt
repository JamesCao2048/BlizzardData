[KeyBindings] NullPointerException while running UiTestSuite
I saw this exception while preparing the submission for I200409140800. The
exception occurs in  Bug66182 Test.testWindow(), but is set in motion by
Bug43610 Test.testShiftAlt().
Basically, there appears to be an unnecessary
"ESC" key press, but I'm not sure why it causes a problem.

At the point that the multi-key assist shell is made visible, the display is
null.
This display is provided in the constructor, and should also be the
display on which the timerExec was started.
