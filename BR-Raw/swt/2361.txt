3.2M6 OS X Label right justify jammed up on the right
SWT/OS X Label right justify jams the text right up on the right edge of the label versus some space when left justified.  Works fine on Windows.
Work around is to use CLabel, which handles this correctly
But awkward that a widget as basic as a Label cannot right justify correctly when run on OS X.
