Use cairo instead of gdk_draw_pixbuf()
What I did in the patch below:
gdk_draw_pixbuf() was already set us dynamic, however casts was causing problem when compiling against GTK+ 3, so I removed  casts.
I have also implemented Cairo alternative in  2 classes, basing on GTK+ docs.
Patch is available here:
