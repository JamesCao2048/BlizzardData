Combo API doc/problems
v3030
The add(String,int) method should throw an InvalidRange error when int is < 0
as the API states and to be consistent with List.  The test case for the add
method includes this particular scenario (the code is currently commented out).
The documentation for the setItem(String) and setItems(String[]) methods should
indicate that NullArgument exception thrown.
