StyledText: Cannot overtype contents if text limit reached
If I set the text limit for a StyledText using StyledText.setTextLimit() and then add text up to that limit, I cannot subsequently add any more text even if I have pressed insert to toggle the overwrite behaviour. Deleting one character allows the overtyping to occur as expected.
I have attached a test case but the key lines are:
StyledText t = new StyledText(shell, SWT.BORDER);
t.setText("Press insert and try to type in this box");
t.setTextLimit(t.getText().length());
I would expect the StyledText to allow extra text to be typed when the ST.TOGGLE_OVERWRITE action has been peformed even if the text limit has been reached.
I have a workaround for this issue which involves adding a KeyListener to the StyledText which deletes the character after the current caret position if the text limit has been reached.
