Pressing TAB key creates junk in editor
1. Create a new build.xml file.
2. Enter the following contents, indenting the lines with tabs as shown:
<project default="sleep">
<target name="sleep">
<sleep seconds="10"/>
</target>
</project>
3. Place the cursor in front of the <target tag and press TAB. The editor line will change to display:
<tar<target name="sleep">
The junk is just a region that's not getting redrawn correctly. The characters aren't really there.
