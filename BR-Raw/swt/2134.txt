Display.getActiveShell() returns different results on Windows compared to Linux
Build ID: M20060921-0945
Steps To Reproduce:
I'm using a combo box control and have implemented the modifyText() method of a ModifyListener.
In that method I get the active shell by calling PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().getActiveShell().
On Windows XP this returns a Shell, but on Linux gtk it returns null.
Shouldn't it return a Shell on Linux too?
I've attached a small plug-in based on the Hello World template that shows the issue.
It adds a button to the main toolbar.
Press the button, make a change in the combo box and then look at the console.
On windows it reports that the shell is not null.
On Linux the console shows that it was null.
