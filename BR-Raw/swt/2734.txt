Antialiasing memory leak
SWT 3138, WinXP :
When setting the antialising using either :
gc.setAntialias(SWT.ON);
or
gc.setTextAntialias(SWT.ON);
the application leaks (at a rate of approcimately 300kB/s => 20MB is leaked
every minute)
I experience the leak from the windows taks manager, GDI objects is constant,
same with handles, but memory keep raising.
If I turn off the antialiasing in the application (while debugging with
eclipse), the leak stops, if I turn it back on, the leak comes back.
