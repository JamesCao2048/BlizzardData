Second window comes to front when using first
I use two Eclipse windows. If I switch in from another application to one Eclipse window, and then
click on a docked view, or perspective, the other window comes to the front over my other
applications' windows. Unless I click on the Eclipse dock icon, the only time a window should come
to the front is if I click on it explicitly (or some behavior takes me to a widget in the other window).
