Difficult to change character case of cached input values
I used the incorrect case for a character in a cvs repository path that I was
defining.  It is subsiquently impossible to enter the correct path because
Eclipse insists on inserting the incorrect value into the field and does not
allow me to type over the incorrect character (when I replace the character it
is immediatly reverted back to the incorrect character and the cursor is thrown
to the end of the field).
In the end I managed to get it to work by manually editing the file
org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/.cvsProviderState, but this was inconvenient to say
the least.
