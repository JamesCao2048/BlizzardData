[Workbench] CTabFolder flashes on tab switch
I20040420
My system background colour is set to grey.
Java editors in eclipse have a
white background.
When I switch between two editors, I see a flash to the grey
system background colour.
The grey is visible for a fair amount of time during
the switch, and even longer if it is the first time I have accessed the file
either in the current session or after it has been inactive for some time.
The
same behavior can be seen upon switching view tabs (easier to see when the view
is maximized).
A plausible reason for the flash may be that when we show the next widget, X
initially fills the window to the background colour until the widget has a
chance to draw itself.
