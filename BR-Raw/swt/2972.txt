[browser] widget not sized properly
I was using I20040528-0010 build.
The browser wiget on motif displays about 200x200 size, not the size parent
expects it to take.  Resizing a window causes browser to be redrawn correctly.
This is visible when launching help, as well as using "bring up the browser" SWT
snippet.
Interestingly if shell.setSize() is not called before shell.open(), it works
(browser widget taking correct size).
If shell.setSize() is called before and after shell.open(), it does not work.
If shell.setSize() is called before and after shell.open(), and shell had
SWT.DIALOG_TRIM style, it works.
