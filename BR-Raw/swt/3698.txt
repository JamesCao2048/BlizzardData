ImageLoader.save for GIF saves in compress GIF format
We are using the ImageLoader class successfully to export Image to the
filesystem.
private void saveImageToGif(Image image, String destination) {
ImageData imageData = image.getImageData();
ImageLoader imageLoader = new ImageLoader();
imageLoader.data = new ImageData[] { imageData };
imageLoader.logicalScreenHeight = image.getBounds().width;
imageLoader.logicalScreenHeight = image.getBounds().height;
imageLoader.save(destination, SWT.IMAGE_GIF);
}
There is an issue however that the GIF image produced is in compressed format.
The problem is that the default for Windows is to use Microsoft Windows
Picture and Fax Viewer when opening GIF files from the filesystem.
This viewer does not support compressed GIF files.
As a workaround for our users, you can right click on the GIF file and do Open
With. If you open with Microsoft Photo Editor or Microsoft Internet Explorer,
the GIF file is fine.
However, we would rather have the option added to image loader to produce an
image in non compressed format.
