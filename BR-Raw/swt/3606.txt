StyledText - add getStyleRanges(start, offset) API
Currently you can get the style range at a particular offset and you can get
all style ranges, but there is no API for getting the styles for a particular
range of text.
While getStyleRanges could be used to ascertain this
information, this could be inefficient if your text has a lot of text (i.e.,
this method creates a copy of all style ranges).
