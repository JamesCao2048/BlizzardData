Missing selectionEvent when disposing TreeItem
When I remove a TreeItem from my Tree by using TreeItem.dispose()
another item is 'armed' (as in 'ready to be selected'
- on Windows the
item has normal font color and grey background) as opposed to
'selected' (on Windows inverted font color and dark blue background).
The important part is this: When this happen in 3.0.1 a selectionEvent
is sent.
In 3.1M4 this event is missing.
AFAICS this means you have no
control over where the current selection is in the Tree before the user
selects another item.
