SWT workspace is full of SWT tools errors
1.Pull the latest SWT source code.
2.Enable SWT Tools > report 32/64 bit problems.
3.Rebuild the project.
Project is filled with errors:
[32/64] Syntax error, annotations are only available if source level is 1.5 or greater
The problem is in the SWT tools. There are more than 900 errors now in the workspace and its easy to miss any valid 32/64 bit errors because of this.
We need to fix the tools before making any Java 1.5 language changes to the SWT source code.
