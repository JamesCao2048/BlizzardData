Tracker does not keep up with mouse movement
I am using a Tracker with SWT.RIGHT | SWT.LEFT style bits and one Rectangle
that indicates the location of something.
I want that Rectangle to maintain
its vertical location and only move in the horizontal direction.
The problem
is that if I move the Tracker using the move, it ignores movement in the
horizontal direction that coincides with the movement in the vertical
direction.
That is, if I move my mouse just to the right, it's fine.

However, if I move it to the right and bottom, then it ignores both those
movements.
Hence, the feedback rectangle does not keep up with the mouse.

It's difficult to move the mouse in the horizontal direction without changing
the vertical location.
What the tracker should do is ignore just the vertical
change, but still respect the horizontal change.
