Colors returned by Mac Color Dialog get shifted based on calibrated color space
Build Identifier: I20100608-0911
The color dialog on Mac takes in an RGB value and generates an NSColor using device colorspace, then the user manipulates the values manually.
The NSColor is then transformed using the calibrated colorspace and then converted into an RGB object.
That conversion leads to a shifting of values.
In cases where the user is using the eyedropper, this is probably the correct way to handle things, but if the user is manually entering HSB/RGB values then we may want to retain the value exactly.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a color dialog
2.Enter in 190, 0, 19 in HSB
3.Returned RGB value gets mapped to 190,0,14 for me when passed back into next open of color dialog.
