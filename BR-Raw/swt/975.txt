BlockSelection: Paste should end with long caret
I20090514-2000
StyledText in BlockSelection mode: When I copy a block and then paste it multiple times, all copies should be start on the same line.
=> Paste should end with a long caret that spans all modified lines at the end of the pasted block.
Example:
- Have:
Abcdef
123456
- Select:
Abc
123
- Copy, Paste, Paste
=> Result:
Abcdef
123Abc456
123
=> Expected:
AbcAbcdef
123123456
