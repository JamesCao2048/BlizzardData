[interop] swing mouse events not received in RCP plugin
(m5 & m6) in an RCP plugin
Mouse events for Swing controls (JTree and JButton) are not received if they
are placed directly in the Frame created by new_Frame.
A Panel must be added to
the Frame and then the Swing controls added to the Panel.
A plain AWT button works fine.
public void createPartControl(Composite parent)
{
m_frame = SWT_AWT.new_Frame(parent);
m_frame.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
m_frame.add(new JButton("hello"), BorderLayout.NORTH);
m_frame.add(new Button("hello 2"), BorderLayout.SOUTH);
m_frame.add(new JTree(), BorderLayout.CENTER);
}
I have experimented with more complex AWT/Swing componenets.
Tomsawyer must have the panel
OpenViz must NOT have a panel!
