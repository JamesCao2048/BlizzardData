[OpenGL] Mac GLCanvas does not immediately update GL state upon resize
The fixBounds method gets asyncExec'ed when a resize, hide or show event occurs... is there any reason this can't be called immediately? The problem is that I receive notification of the resize and try to draw to the canvas, but the drawing becomes invalid as soon as the fixBounds method gets called... fixBounds should've already been called before I started drawing!
I am trying to do selective updates instead of just redrawing the screen constantly, so it's crucial that when I'm told about a resize I can immediately draw and the GL state will already be up to date. Specifically, I am trying to plug in an OpenGL version of the Draw2D Graphics class, and resizing the window creates a bunch of screen garbage because of this problem.
Looking at the source for the Windows and Linux implementations of GLCanvas, it looks like they update their GL state immediately when notified of a resize event. Shouldn't the behavior be uniform across platforms?
