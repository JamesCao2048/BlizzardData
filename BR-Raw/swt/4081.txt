Variable sorting changes unexpectedly
1. Debug the following program to a breakpoint on the first line of foo().
Variables view looks like:
this = VariableTest
2. Perform a step over.
Variables view looks like:
x = 1
this = VariableTest
3. Perform a step over.
Variables view looks like:
this = VariableTest
y = 2
x = 1
The ordering of existing variables shouldn't change when new variables are
added.
public class VariableTest {
public static void main(String[] args) {
new VariableTest().foo();
}
private void foo() {
int x= 1;  // BREAKPOINT HERE
int y= 2;
System.out.println("Grah");
}
}
