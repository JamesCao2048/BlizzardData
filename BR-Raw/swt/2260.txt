moving column can lose sort indicator
3.3M2, gtk+ 2.4.13
- run the ControlExample and go to either the Table or Tree tab
- turn on:
Multiple Columns
Header Visible
Sort Indicator
Moveable Columns
Resizable Columns
- this puts the sort indicator in the first column
- move the first column to follow the second column, this works fine
- now move this column back to become the first ordered column and note that the sort indicator has disappeared
