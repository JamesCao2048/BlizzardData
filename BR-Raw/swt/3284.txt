No mouse up when tree expansion indicator selected
The Macintosh eats the up in this case, probably internally calling
TrackMouseLocation() somewhere in the DataBrowser code.
This manifests itself in Eclipse as 'single click ignored'.  You expand a
bunch of tree nodes and then single click on an item, it selects and nothing
happens.  Then you click again on the item and the selection action happens.
