[DirectoryDialog] There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive DeviceHarddisk0DR0
Any operation which brings up a file dialog box rooted at "My Computer" tosses
up a dialog box with the above error message whenever a harddrive is expanded.
Click cancel or try again on dialog (has cancel, try again, and continue) twice,
and then it opens up the disk, and proceeds normally.

If you un-expand a drive, it does the same thing.
Then again when you re-expand a drive.
Examples:
Import
-> File System
-> click Browse
Feature.xml
-> Export
-> click Browse
I have seen this all the way back through M4. May have existed sooner.
Currently using RC3.
