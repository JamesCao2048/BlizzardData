Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a program that draws FIRST a text (gc.drawText)
2. then draws an oval (gc.drawOval)
3. In addition to the text and oval, the result includes a line connecting the upper left point of the text with the right mid side of the oval.
More information:
The issue moste likely caused by the fact that drawText contains a
Cairo.cairo_move_to(cairo, x, baseline);
but state information is not cleared.
After this, calling the drawOval contains a
Cairo.cairo_arc_negative call followed by a Cairo.cairo_stroke.
The last call draws the connecting line too (remaining in the stae from the drawText)
Hint: drawText should correctly clear the internal state of the cairo lib.
