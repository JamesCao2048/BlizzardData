Accessible should not add dispose listener to its control
In the GTk implementation of accessibility, a dispose listener is added to the Accessible's control right in the Accessible constructor in order to do cleanup when the control is disposed.
All of the other platforms call internal_dispose_Accessible from inside releaseWidget.
GTk should use the same release/cleanup mechanism as the other platforms.
This cannot be fixed right now because it involves adding a public method (even though it is "internal", it will be flagged by the API tooling, and no new API is allowed in now)
