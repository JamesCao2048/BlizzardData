[Browser] After clicking certain links, mouse/key events are not sent anymore
Build Identifier: SWT N20101017-2000
When adding input events to trigger certain actions, they stop working after a link calling a JS action is clicked.
This was tested with a recent nightly build and 3.6, both have the issue.
I only tried with IE.
For some users, this can be very problematic.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Browser with mouse/key listeners.
2.invoke a link in the form
<a href="javascript:void(0)"> or
<a href="javascript:alert('a text')">
3.Click/type in the browser: events are not sent anymore.
