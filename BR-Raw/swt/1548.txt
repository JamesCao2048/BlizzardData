carriage return inserted twice when using text box in web browser
Steps to reproduce (with internal browser on Windows):
1) Open internal browser in Eclipse
2) Click [edit] on an Eclipsepedia page
3) Hit the "Enter" key in the edit box, you will see two carriage returns
Expected behavior (with Internet Explorer on Windows):
2) as above
3) as above, only get one carriage return
Marking as major as this could be perceived as a regression by web developers and anyone else making use of the internal browser.
