Coolbar icons in Windows XP with Luna theme are not vertically aligned.
Icons on Coolbar in Windows XP with Luna theme are not vertically aligned.
When you reposition coolbars, they realign themselves.
Happens in any view (Java in particular). If Windows Classic Style (ala W2K) is
selected, problem disappears.
Highly annoying.
