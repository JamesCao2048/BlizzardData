LineStyles in Very Long Lines Takes Forever
Well, not literally forever, but way way too long -- users will have to "end
process" and start over.  Bug 108806  is the most recent one opened against us in
WTP, but have seen before for less extreme examples. I'm opening this bug to
determine what improvements can be made at SWT level. I've marked as major since
bug 108806  was marked as major by user-client.
For the case described in  bug 108806 , I've noticed that for the 500K character
line, we produce about 100K "styles" passed back to StyledText via
LineStyleEvent. One thing I noticed, for
example, is that a loop in DisplayRenderer goes through each style, eventually
calling TextLayout.setStyle. There, is some code in there which is creating a
(new) array of TextStyles, and it grows the array one item at a time, ending up
using 100K System.arraycopies to grow the array "as they come in one by one". I
did not test, but seems there might be ways to anticipate the size of this array
and avoid all those array copies?
So, first question ... why is it even requested of us to provide "all
StyleRanges" for the line, when they are not all visible, obviously. Could some
short cut be made there?
Second question, do you think these "DisplayRendering" methods could be made
more efficient, to at least allow user to limp along, or would problems just be
encountered further along, such as is they try to type.
Third question, any advice on how to proceed?
