public Image (Device device, String filename) fails on WinCe
public Image (Device device, String filename)
has a try catch like this
try {
device.checkGDIP();
...
} catch  (SWTException e) {
}
The problem is that in checkGDI we have a:
if (OS.IsWinCE) SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED);
That throws a SWTError that is not catch in clause 'catch  (SWTException e)'
SSQ, do you want me to replace 'catch  (SWTException e)' by 'catch  (SWTError e)' ?
