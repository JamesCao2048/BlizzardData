Tree does not use the OSs selected column background color
The Table sets a selected column background color on Win32 using the .manifest file.  (Hopefully a configurable option in the future)
An option to use this same color on a Tree's selected columns is not available, nor is this color available from Display.getSystemColor() so that it could be emulated by the app for consistency between Trees and Tables.
