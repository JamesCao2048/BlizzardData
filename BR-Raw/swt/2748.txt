XP Look and Feel - 3D border appearance on some widgets does not match single blue line border on other widgets
Not sure if this is a bug in the way our bordering works, or in the example,
etc.
- click on the Text tab in the control example
- click on the SWT.BORDER flag
- notice Text widget is bordered with a flat, light blue rectangle, but
StyledText widget is highlighted with a 3D border.
