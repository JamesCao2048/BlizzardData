StyledText - Shift+UP broken in StyledText control
In 2.1, StyledText (I assume) was changed to remember the horizontal location
of the cursor as the user presses UP and DOWN arrow keys.
This is great for
general navigation (thanks).
But this remembered location should be forgotten
when selecting text with the Keyboard.
StyledText is not showing platform
behavior.
STEPS:
<Given the following scenario, including blank lines>
String
<<CARET>>value = "abc";
</End scenario>
With the caret in the location indicated, press UP key, then SHIFT+DOWN.
The
expectation is that only the blank line is selected.
Instead, the blank line
and the beginning of the next line up until the cached location is selected.
