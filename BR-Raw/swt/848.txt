[browser] onbeforeunload not sent when browser disposed
Scenario: browser widget hosted by eclipse, web page loaded.
If I hook an onbeforeunload js function in a web page that hook does not get
called if you close the browser view by clicking the x in the tab or by choose
close from the popup menu.
If you navigate() to another URL the hooks is called
just fine.
Normally, this should not an issue, but IE specifially has problem releasing
memory when circular references between JS code and DOM objects exist.

So in some situations, this is absolutely necessary as otherwise big memory
leaks can happen (for example some top level divs have ciruclar references in
play
- in which case the whole DOM may not be freed correctly).
A work around would be that on close, a browser widget could navigate to an
empty page (the navigation will trigger the onbeforeunload).
The empty page has
nothing of value so closing it without calling the proper hooks should do less harm.
I have searched the archives and I can't figure out how to do the workaround.
It
seems that .dispose() is the right place to hook the code, but at that point,
it's too late.
I would need to hook to the close event event and be the first
listner to be run to correctly solve this ...
anyway to do this ?
