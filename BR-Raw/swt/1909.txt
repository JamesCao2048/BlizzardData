[KeyBindings] interactions: Ctrl+Shift+I does not arrive at display KeyDown filter
When, I press Ctrl+Shift+I, I get the following trace.
There are two things that are odd.
First of all, the modified "I" KeyDown event never arrives.
Secondly, when I press the "I", it triggers a selection change to null, and then back to the previous selection.
This happens in both the Outline view, Console view and a Java editor ...
so it doesn't seem to widget specific.
