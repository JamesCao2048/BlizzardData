XULRunner path may not work for SWT browser
Build Identifier: 3.4.2
If add -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=${rcp.home}/rcp/eclipse/plugins/xulrunner in rcpinstall.properties. Because of the mix use of "/" and "\" in the XULRunnerpath,SWT browser is not able to find the XULRunner runtime. A simple test would be to create SWT browser instance with SWT.MOZILLA. This will lead to an exception in XPCOM. Suggested patch provided. Propose as an enhancement request.
Reproducible: Always
