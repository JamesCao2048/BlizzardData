Clarify/improve TextLayout.setText(String)
3.4 M6.
TextLayout.setText(String) has two undocumented side effects:
1. if the new string is not the same as the old one it sets the text *and* it
resets all the style information
2. if the new string is the same it does nothing
Currently - as there is no reset[Styles]() method clients have to read the code and then do the following to reset their text layout in order to reuse it:
textLayout.setText(""); // ensure styles get cleared
textLayout.setText(realText);
A good fix for me would be:
1. document that setText also clears the style information
2. always clear the style information. I guess that is what clients would expect
