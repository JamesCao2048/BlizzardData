Text widget with Tree parent does not lose focus
build 20020920
Run the attached code.
The left tree and text behave as they should on Windows and Linux.
When you
click anywhere in the tree the tree gets focus.
Both widgets are children of
the shell.
The right tree and text only work on Windows.
On Linux the text never loses
focus when you click on the tree.
The text widget is a child of the tree.
This causes platform UI  bug 2470 .
We can probably work around by creating the
text editor as a sibling of the tree and moving it above the tree.
