"Quick Type Hierarchy" window briefly appears, then disappears.
Build N20090329-2000, but has been happening for a while.
The Quick Type Hierarchy window flashes briefly and then disappears.
Steps:
1. Check out an SWT tree.
2. Go to Widget.java
3. In the editor pane, click on something that you know has been overridden (windowDidMove, for example)
4. Hit cmd-T
===> The IDE works for a bit and then the type hierarchy window appears and then immediately hides.
Expected:
The type hierarchy window opens and stays open.
