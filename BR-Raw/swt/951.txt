[Browser] Snippet173 doesn't block popup window
Snippet173 opens cnn.com, but they don't open any popup windows.
I tried creating my own HTML that does call window.open onload, but Snippet173 didn't block that window from opening either.
My HTML:
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body onload="window.open(' http://www.eclipse.org/swt/','SWT ')">
<FORM>
Hello World
</FORM>
</body>
</html>
