perspective button goes blank after closing perspective
3.2M2
observed on linux-motif and hpux, but not on gtk, so appears to be swt problem
- drag the CBanner's separator to ~ the 50% mark
- press its "Open Perspective" button, switch to the Debug perspective
- after the perspective switch is done, right-click the Debug button in the
CBanner and select Close
- this returns you to the previous perspective, but its button in the CBanner
now appears blank
- will attach screenshot next
