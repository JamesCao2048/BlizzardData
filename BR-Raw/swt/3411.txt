BidiUtil static var retains references to runnables from StyledText
When a StyledText is created, a runnable is added to the BidiUtil (line 1619:
BidiUtil.addLanguageListener(*)).
On dispose of the StyledText, the listener is only removed if isBidi() returns
true (line 4873)
It would appear that the listener is never removed.
