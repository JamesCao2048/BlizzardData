CTabFolder close box should highlight without needing mouse move
1. Open several tabs with long enough titles such that they will have same (max) tab width
2. Close one on the left, using the mouse, and leave the mouse pointer where it is
Observe 1: the next tab right will replace the deleted one (naturally)
Observe 2: even though the mouse ptr is directly over the close box, the close box is not visible.  You need to move the mouse to get it to light up.
The issue is that, when closing many tabs, its nice to just keep clicking to close.  You can do this in Firefox 2.0 quite nicely.
The problem is likely that the close box only lights up via mouse move.  We also need to check as a result of tab close.
