A client has submitted this issue for our product:
Steps:
1. Using XP's eudcedit utility, create an "End User Defined Character" and map it to a specific font (Courier New for example)
2. In Notepad, we can set the font to Courier New and insert the EUDC using the Character Map utility, and it will display correctly (see notepad.gif)
3. In eclipse, we tried to do the same in text editor and also Java editor, but the character does not display (see eclipse.gif)
4. Note that if the EUDC is mapped to all fonts, then the character does display in eclipse correctly (see eclipse2.gif)
