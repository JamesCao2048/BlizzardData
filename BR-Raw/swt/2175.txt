[Progress] Random shells come to the front when compare editor shows progress dialog
[I20061128-0800]
Sometimes, when opening a compare editor from the sync view, other random shells (e.g.
Firefox, Notes...) come to the front.
This seems to be related to showing progress in a dialog.
It does not happen if the compare results are displayed fast enough.
