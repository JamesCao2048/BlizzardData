Background colour not propagated inside group or tabfolder
I200409211200
The GTK+ theme "Indubstrial" is now the default in GNOME 2.8.One thing it does
is to use a lighter background colour inside notebooks (GtkNotebook) and group
boxes (GtkFrame).
This background colour is not being propagated to the child
widgets in SWT.
