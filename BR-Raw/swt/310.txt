Drag in Webkit Browser is disabled.
Build Identifier:  I20110613-1736; I20110805-1200
Drag in Webkit Browser is disabled in WebKit.java due to a bug of WebKitGTK:
/*
* Bug in WebKitGTK.  Dragging an image quickly and repeatedly can cause
* WebKitGTK to take the mouse grab indefinitely and lock up the display,
* see  https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32840 .  The workaround is
* to veto all drag attempts.
*/
But it seems that the bug is fixed. So we might re-enable the drag in browser.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a Browser using new Browser(shell, SWT.WEBKIT);
2. run, open a page and try to drag something in the browser
3. The drag is disabled.
