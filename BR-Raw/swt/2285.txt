SWT Table column resize issue
If you double click the column resizer (line splitting two column in table column header) in a SWT Table with first column being numbers ,the column shrinks so that you cannot view the entire column data.This happens only for the first column with numbers.
Usually the column should resize to show the datas properly .only the table column name is showed truncated.But here the column data is itself hidden.
