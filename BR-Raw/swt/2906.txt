CTabFolder hidden tabs count (in chevron) can become 0
0420 integration build (showed VI already)
- drag several eclipse views into one view slot (eg.- on top of the Navigator)
-> assuming that there isn't room to show all of the tabs, there will be a
chevron shown with a number representing the number of hidden tabs
- slowly make the top view more narrow, and as this makes the CTabFolder more
narrow, the number of tabs that it can fit will shrink, and therefore the
number below the chevron will grow
- but you'll reach a point where this number becomes 0, when it should probably
be equal to the number of tabs in the tabfolder
