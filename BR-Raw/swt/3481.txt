[browser] breaking change - rename LocationEvent.cancel to LocationEvent.doit and reverse boolean meaning
To be consistent with SelectionListener and since SWT does not use cancel
anywhere:
LocationEvent.cancel should probably be renamed LocationEvent.doit
where cancel was false by default, doit is true by default
