[accessibility] text-based ToolItems read out their help/tooltip text instead of text
Build ID: I20100603-1500
VoiceOver reads back the tooltip help of a ToolItem with text. It should read the text if the tool item is just a button.
1. Launch org.eclipse.swt.examples.accessibility.ControlsWithLabelsExample
2. Turn on VoiceOver.
3. Move the VoiceOver cursor to the Toolbar. The ToolItems are labelled "Item0", "Item1", "Item2".
--> VoiceOver reads back "ToolItem ToolTip0", which is the tooltip text for Item0. It should have said Item0 because it's a text button.
Not a 3.6 regression.
