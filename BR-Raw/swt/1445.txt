Unable to scroll fast using MX Revolution Mouse
I use the Logitech MX Revolution mouse which has a fast scrolling function. (the wheel will spin freely giving high scroll speeds).
When I scroll in Eclipse, it is slow and will not scroll as fast as the wheel is turning. This causes the scrolling to abruptly change directions and not stop even if the wheel is no longer turning.
Thanks
