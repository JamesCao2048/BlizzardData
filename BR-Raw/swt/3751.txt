Rapid button pressing
I've noticed that the buttons I create with SWT seem to have problems
responding to rapid mouse clicks.
Here's the basic scenario: I create a
button on a Composite, without necessarily adding any
SelectionListeners.
Then I (compile, run, and) click it many times in
fast succession.
Visually, the button appears to depress on about every
other click.
However (by adding a listener), I can tell that selection
events are being fired with every click.
The overall effect is jolting
-- the button appears to do its business too many times (since I
intuitively expect it to function only as many times as it depresses).
When I use a native windows app, I can quick as fast as I like, and I
will see a depression with each click.
If you compile the following, and
click on the button quickly 10 times, the "click" counter will run up to
9, but you'll see 5 depresses (I think ...
it's hard to count).

final Button button = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH);
button.setText("click me");
button.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() {
public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e) {
System.out.println("click: " + count++);
button.update();
}
});
shell.pack();
shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed ())
if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();
display.dispose ();
}
}
