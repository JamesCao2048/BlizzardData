Busy cursor lost over progress indicator edges
Whenever BusyIndicator.showWhile() is used around a ProgressMonitorDialog,
there are 1 pixel borders around the progress indicator that retain the default
cursor.
The busy cursor should be active for the entire ProgressMonitorDialog.
To reproduce:
1) Check something out of CVS that will take around 10 seconds.
2) While the operation is in progress, mouse over the busy indicator.
3) Depending on how fast you moved the cursor, you will see the cursor flash
over the borders of the busy indicator.
If you stop the cursor on the correct
pixel, the busy cursor changes back to the normal cursor.
This behaviour was observed in F1 on Windows.
Linux-Motif does not exhibit this
behaviour.
