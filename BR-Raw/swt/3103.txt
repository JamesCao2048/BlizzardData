implement GC.drawFocus
I20041208-gtk
GC.drawFocus simply draws a solid line.
This is correctly following the javadoc,
that says that this may happend if drawing the focus is not supported.
However: this seems like a serious limitation to anyone implementing custom
widgets.
Is there any chance that this will be implemented on GTK?
This is really a dup of point 2 of  bug 62424 , however, it also mentions other
things, so I filed this one separately.
