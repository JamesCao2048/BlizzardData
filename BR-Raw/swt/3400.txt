Tables & Images refresh problem
When setting an image on a table at a column >0 , every time the image is
refreshed, the last bottom line of the image of the tableitem on the column>0
does not get refreshed properly.
This ends up having messy lines below the
images on columns > 0 .
This issue only appears with Windows, under Linux it is fine.
Is this a windows
bug or SWT bug ?
