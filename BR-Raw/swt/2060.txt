Table selection with CTRL+SHIFT does not send events
To reproduce the problem, have a table with the following items:
item_1
item_2
item_3
item_4
item_4
- Click on item_1. Now item_1 is selected and the TableViewer notifies the SelectionListener
- Hold CTRL and click on item_3. Now item_1 and item_3 is selected and the TableViewer notifies the SelectionListener
- Hold CTRL and SHIFT and click on item_5. Now item_1, item_3, item_4 and item_5 is selected, but the TableViewer does NOT notify the selectionListener, neither does the table widget.
I would expected, that the selectionListener of both the Table and the TableViewer are notified, because the visual selection has actually changed.
I see, that this bug is similar to #19870, but meanwhile the behaviour has changed, because the SHIFT key is no more ignored. It would be nice, if you could fix this bug now.
