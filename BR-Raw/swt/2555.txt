a Tab is not 4 spaces
RC3
Ensure to use Monaco 11 as your default text editor font
- create new file
- type "----" (4 dashes)
- hit Tab key
Notice: the cursor advances by 1 pixel
- type "----" (4 dashes)
See result in first attachment.
It seems that
Tab = 4 * space + 1
This makes Java auto indent very hard to use on Mac.
I tried the same in TextEdit and get the (expected) result shown in  attachment 2   [details] .
