StyledText - inefficient redraw during text change with word wrap
build 20020416
Appending N lines to StyledText in word wrap mode results in N redraws of the
entire client area.
This should at a maximum only be one redraw for each
visible line.
Run the test case below to reproduce.
Add the following line to
StyledText#performPaint to see the redraws occurring:
System.out.println("lineCount " + lineCount + ", paintY " + paintY + ",
renderHeight " + renderHeight);
