TableCursor.paint() uses string != "", should be string.length() > 0
Build ID: N20070405-0010
Steps To Reproduce:
In browsing the code, I happened to notice that in class org.eclipse.swt.custom.TableCursor, function paint(Event) includes this code:
String text = row.getText(columnIndex);
if (text != "") { //$NON-NLS-1$
Of course it is not correct to use "!=" when comparing Java strings.
Probably just a simple mistake
-- the author probably intended:
if (text.length() > 0) {
or,
if (!text.equals("")) { //$NON-NLS-1$
