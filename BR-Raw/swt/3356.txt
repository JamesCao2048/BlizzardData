Photon: Tree.java references java.util.Stack (not in JDK 1.1)
In the past, the SWT team has been careful to avoid the collection classes,
especially those introduced after JDK 1.1.x.
However, in recompiling the
latest SWT source on several platforms against an older JCL implementation, I
noticed that Tree.java is making use of java.util.Stack.
No other SWT class on
this or any other platform is using one of the newer collection classes.
Can
this be rewritten to use arrays or a Vector, or is it no longer considered
taboo to use these types of collection classes in SWT source code?
Here's where I find a Stack being used:
