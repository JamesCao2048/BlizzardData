SWT Shell with a Grid Layout containing a List
An org.eclipse.swt.widgets.List is not displayed when using in  an org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridLayout on Linux with GTK+ >=2.18.4 as it does in Windows (any) or other components in Linux (Text, Combo, etc.)
It requires to set explicitly the hints.
Having in a class:
:
private List list = null;
:
:
shell = new Shell();
:
shell.setLayout(new GridLayout());
list = new List(shell, SWT.NONE);
Adds the List to the Shell, but is not displayed in Linux as it does in Windows.
