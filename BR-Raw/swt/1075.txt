findProgram("a.null and void") returns Text Edit instead of null
Test case:
Program prg = Program.findProgram("a.null and void");
On other platforms prg will be null.
UI test suite relies on this behavior.
On cocoa tests are failing because Text Edit is being opened up in front of the workbench and screwing up window activation.
