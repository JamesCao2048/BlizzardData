Cursor X/Y hotspots don't work with all constructors
When using org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Cursor(Device device, ImageData source, int
hotspotX, int hotspotY) [win32 version] to create a custom cursor, the
hotspotX/hotspotY parameters are ignored. They're checked for validity at the
top of the function, but then they're never referenced again.
