Popup menus: unexpected appearance of application context menus
Builds: Eclipse SDK Mac OSX Cocoa N20081126-2000 (compared to Carbon N20081126-2000)
In the context of the SWT Controls Example, re the popup menu:

Unlike for Carbon, in a number of controls, a right-click on the control opens an application context menu instead of the expected sample popup menu, or when no popup menu is expected (popup menus are disabled).

In response to a right-click on the control...

For Cocoa:
-- Combo control: application context menu appears, both when popups are disabled and when enabled.
(Oddly, when the control itself is disabled, the sample popup menu appears.)
-- CoolBar control: as expected, except for application context menu that appears in the text area, irrespective of whether popups are enabled or disabled.
(This does not happen for Carbon.)
-- Link control: application context menu appears when popups are disabled.
-- Sash control: application context menu appears in the text area, both when popups are disabled and when enabled.
(Aside from this context menu in the text area, popup menus do not seem to be working.
For Carbon, popups do not seem to be working at all.)
-- Spinner control: application context menu appears, both when popups are disabled and when enabled.
-- Text control: application context menu appears when popups are disabled.
-- Browser control: browser context menu appears when popups are disabled.
(This also happens for Carbon, and may be correct).

For Carbon:
-- When popup menus are disabled, popups never seem to appear, except in the Browser control (see above).
-- When popup menus are enabled, the popups that appear are always the sample popup menu.
