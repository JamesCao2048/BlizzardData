user gtk setting should be checked before adding "Input Methods" item to context menus
The automatic adding of GTK's "Input Methods" menu item to context menus can be disabled as described in  http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.newcomer/msg20408.html  .
SWT inheirits this behaviour in most cases, but one place where it doesn't is StyledText, where the only criteria used is whether KeyDown or KeyUp is hooked.
Showing a context menu in a StyledText (and possibly other emulated controls) should check this property in addition to the KeyDown/KeyUp-is-hooked check when deciding whether to add this item.
