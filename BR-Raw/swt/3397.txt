Program.getProgram() Does Not Get Default Command
On Windows XP:
When a Program object for a certain extension is fetched with findProgram(), the
private getProgram() method is called to load the Program instance.
When it
gets the command from the registry it gets the "open" command, which is located
at shellopencommand for a specific program.
The problem is that open may not be the default command for that program.
The
default command seems to be specified in shell.
So when you use execute() for
a file, the "open" command occurs instead of the default command like in Windows
Explorer.
In Windows Explorer, if you right click on a file the default command
is in bold.
I'll attach a screenshot of the registry entry for Winamp.File.
There are three
commands besides "open", Enqueue being the default command (set as shell's
default value) on my machine.
