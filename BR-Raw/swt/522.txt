[widgets] Clicking in empty space can cause clicks in views
1. Open the Java perspective, or any other perspective where there's a view on the left (e.g. Package Exlorer), and no open views to the right of it.
2. Click once within the view on the left.
3. In the empty space to the right, quickly right-click then left-click.
4. This registers as a double-click within the view on the left. The vertical position of the registered double-click will be the same as the vertical position of the mouse.
