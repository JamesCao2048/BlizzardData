Unable to display Today screen when SWT app running on WinCE
Once I have deployed an SWT application to the PocketPC and started the
application, I cannot show the Today screen in the PocketPC.
If I choose Start-
Today, my application is shown instead of the Today screen.
Just open an SWT-based window, and then using the task list button, try to
switch to the Today view
- it continues displaying the SWT app and
changes the title bar to the text "Today".
