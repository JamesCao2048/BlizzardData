DefaultSelection not being sent from Spinner
In Control Example, add a default selection listener to Spinner, hit return while the spinner has focus. No event is sent.
Other widgets use NSEvent.keyCode(), but Spinner is using NSEvent.charactersIgnoringModifiers(). We should be consistent if possible. Not sure which approach is better.
