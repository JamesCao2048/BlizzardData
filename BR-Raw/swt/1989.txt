Change javadoc for Table addSelectionListener
Current javadoc reads:
"Adds the listener to the collection of listeners who will be notified when the receiver's selection changes, by sending it one of the messages defined in the SelectionListener  interface."
This is not true since the receiver's selection can change programatically and an event will not be sent.
Adding a note about this issue would be very helpful.
