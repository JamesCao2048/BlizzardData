DND copy and link are allowed with default mouse gesture
RC2 - observed on all motif platforms
- run the DND example
- select the DragSource and DropTarget checkboxes
- select the Text Transfer checkboxes for each
- select the SWT.DROP_COPY checkboxes for each
- deselect the SWT.DROP_MOVE checkboxes for each
- drag from the left example widget to the right example widget and note that
it is allowed, which should not be the case since CTRL was not pressed
- a similar behaviour occurs with SWT.DROP_LINK
