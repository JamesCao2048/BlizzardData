editor cheese after code completion
Build id: I20051115-0800
I am occasionally getting cheese in the editor after inserting code using
content assist and organize imports in this build.  For example, if I type a
class name, and then hit Ctrl+Shift+M to import it, I get some parts of the text
pushed down by a line while other parts stay put.
I will attach a screen shot as an example. In the screen shot, there is an
invisible line about an inch from the left hand side - everything to the left of
the line is fine, and everything to the right of the line has been pushed down
so the two pieces don't line up.
