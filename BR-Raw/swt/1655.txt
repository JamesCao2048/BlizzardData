setSize on Spinner doesn't have an effect
As Spinner is a composite, setSize doesn't appear to resize the view. However, setting FILL_HORIZONTAL and FILL_VERTICAL do appear to work.
Steps to reproduce:
Run ControlExample
Go to Spinner tab
Click on '10x10', '50x50' or '100x100' - no effect seen
Cilck on Horizontal Fill or Vertical Fill - spinner expands to full size of view
