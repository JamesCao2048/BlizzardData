Whacky behaviour in the update manager with WPF drop of Eclipse on Windows Vista
Eclipse SDK
Version: 3.3.0
Build id: I20070410-1043 (I first noticed this with 3.3M6)
Windows Vista
I've accessed the Europa update site.
When I get to the tree of features, some are already selected.
As I select/deselect features, other features are selected (i.e., their checkboxes get checked).
It's basically unusable (and seemingly unpredicable).
When I eventually dismiss the wizard, a dialog box remains, titled "Update Manager" with "Operation in progress..." and the name of one of the features in it's content area.
I can post an image if required/desired.
Eclipse is usable under the dialog.
The win32 version (same I-build) running on Vista works as expected.
