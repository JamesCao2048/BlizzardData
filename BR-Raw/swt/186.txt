Omit use of deprecated method gdk_drawable_get_size() for newer GTK+ and make it dynamic
Work on gdk_drawable_get_size() started here:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383842
As it was GC widget related, I've decided to open separate bug for implementation of new GTK API calls for newer GTK+ in remaining methods.
What I have done:
Created 2  helper functions:
1.Widget.gdk_pixmap_get_size for pixmaps
2.Widget.gdk_window_get_size for windows
Replaced OS.gdk_drawable_get_size  with these 2 functions in Widget's scope, implemented version guards outside Widget's scope.
Made gtk_drawable_get_size dynamic.
Patch is available here:
