BIDI: text in the rtl-oriented Text control can't be aligned to the trailing edge of this control.
SWT, as usually, uses for creating of it's Text control CreateWindowEx() native
call with WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL extended window's style. In spite of this,
corresponding native Edit control is created as not mirrored window with
WS_EX_RIGHT, WS_EX_LEFTSCROLLBAR and WS_EX_RTLREADING extended styles and
ES_RIGHT alignment style. Therefore contents of rtl-oriented Text control can't
be aligned to it's trailing edge.
We suggest to use WS_EX_RTLREADING and WS_EX_LEFTSCROLLBAR instead of
WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL extended style. Using of alignment styles will depend on
current orientation of Text control.
