Content assist shells movable when clicking on scrollbar thumb
open content assist, click and drag at the very top of the scrollbars thumb which should be at the top of the scroll bar.
The shell moves.
I suspect that the mouse down is going through to the title bar of the shell (which we hid by making the content view big).
The scroll bar should be handling the mouse down.
