StyledText should not fill the clipboard on every selection change
3.1 stream
See  bug 92209 .
Filling the clipboard with the current selection upon every
selection change *really* hurts one test case: selecting big editor areas and
changing the selection with the arrow keys and holding shift (or selecting large
areas with the mouse).
Note that this happens on Windows as well as GTK.
IMO, copying the entire (almost) document content upon every selection change is
way too expensive.
Is there a way to avoid this?
