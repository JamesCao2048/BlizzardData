Strange redraw and disabled behaviour with SWT.CHECK toolitems with and without disabled icons set.
First, have a look at  bug 87635 , note that the way the button looks when
disabled is different depending on whether the toolitem has been checked or not.
Second: on build
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050219-1500
I took the SWT Control example and added a disabled image for checkbox items in
the toolbars on the Toolbar tab and got a number of strange problems:
1) checkboxes drew the disabled and enabled buttons overtop of each other when
disabled
2) when a checkbox was NOT checked it did not use it's disabled icon at all when
it was disabled then when you force a redraw it might draw the disabled over the
enabled or just draw the disabled.
code will be attached.
