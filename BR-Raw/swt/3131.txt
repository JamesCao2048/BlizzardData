[consistency] ProgressBar does not fire some mouse events
Note that on initial inspection this does not seem to be the same as  bug 78554 .
- run the ControlExample, select the ProgressBar tab
- listen for MouseDown, MouseUp, MouseDoubleClick, DragDetect and MenuDetect
- go to the example ProgressBar on the page and try to get any of these to fire
for you, but none will
