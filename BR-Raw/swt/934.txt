"Hide Eclipse" doesn't work properly
Build ID: 20090619-0625
Steps To Reproduce:
1) Go to the Eclipse menu and choose "Hide Eclipse"
2) Click on Eclipse in the dock to bring it back to the foreground
The workbench window comes to the foreground but the menu bar does not repopulate; it still reflects whatever application you were in before you clicked on Eclipse in the dock. You have to command-tab away and back again to get the menu bar to repopulate with Eclipse items.
