Override default behavior of 'F10' key
I'm writing a terminal emulation application that emulates terminals where the
functions keys are valid key strokes, including 'F10'.  I need to be able to
override the default behavior of the 'F10' key to have terminal applications run
properly.  As for the special key sequences (Ctrl + Esc), the default behavior
does not need to be overridden because they are not valid user inputs on a terminal.
Attached is a previous discussion with Steve Northover:
I agree you have the case where you need to see F10.  Please enter a
bugzilla report describing your case to avoid me telling you later that
you don't really need to do this.
The problem I see is that there are all kinds of special key sequences on
the various platforms that do magic things.  We might be able to work
around F10 on Windows but what about Ctrl+Esc?  The list goes on, can
change between operating system releases and is not well documented. Let's
continue the discussion in the bug report.  Please paste in this text.
Thanks.
