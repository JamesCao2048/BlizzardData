Outline "crazy-scrolls" when it gets focus
build i0110
Perhaps related to  bug 120556 .
Steps:
- find a java or class file that has a lot of entries in the Outline view (gives you a scroll bar)
- close the editor
- open the editor
Note that the editor now has focus
- hover over the Outline (don't give it focus)
- use your mouse wheel or laptop scroll button to scroll to the bottom of the Outline
- try to click on an item in the outline
Note that the outline scroll bar is reset to be at the top and the wrong item is selected.
