Mouse pointer not update
Build 20020521
There are several case on Photon where the mouse pointer is not update for the
correct indicator ( resize indicator, dragging indicator, etc).
One case always reproducible is:
1) Mouse over the gripper of a CoolItem, the pointer is replace by a `move
indicator`.
Correct.
2) Switch the editor, when the paint operations is taking place try to mouse
over the Coolitem gripper, the cursor will not be update.
3) Even when the paint is done and the pointer remain stop over gripper the
pointer will not be update.
