StyledText - Arrow_Down in text editor doesn't retain column when it scrolls
3.0M4 (bug is probably much older)
- enter this text (without quotes) into an editor (java or text):
"This is a very long line for testing purposes
This is a very long line for testing purposes"
- make the editor so narrow that only "This is a very" can be seen
- set the cursor to the end of the first long line
- press Arrow_down twice
-> expected: The cursor is at the end of the second long line
-> was: Cursor is after "very", which is the rightmost visible column when the
editor is fully scrolled to the left.
