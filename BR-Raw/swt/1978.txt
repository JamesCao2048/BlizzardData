Filter path does not behave as expected with new GtkFileChooser
3.1M4
On GTK+ 2.4.13, the filter path does not work as I would expect.
If you use
gtk_file_chooser_set_filename with "/home/vektor/.", the chooser does not open
on /home/vektor, but rather on /home with "vektor" selected.
I opened this bug
about it in the GNOME bugzilla:
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161670
I do not remember this behaviour before so it may be a regression in the GTK+
code.
However, there is an easy fix in our code which may actually be clearer
and better anyway.
The fix is to use gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder if the
caller sets a filter path but does not provide a file name.
