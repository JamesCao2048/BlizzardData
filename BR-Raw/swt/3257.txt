ACC - I20030205 - Can't switch tabs using keyboard
Major accessibility issue for Eclipse
Open ControlExample
Give focus to a tab folder. Press Tab or arrow or space or enter or anything:
cannot switch to the next tab folder.
Problem seems that the tab folder 'eats' the arrow key and loses focus instead
of giving focus to the next tab folder.
In Eclipse, you can for example go to Preferences > Debug > launch history and
try switching between the tabs.
Works on Windows.
