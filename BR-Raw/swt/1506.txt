Pixel corruption when setSelection() called from within SWT.SetData
Using I20060125-0800, while debugging, I sometimes get an erratic behavior when scrolling in debug or variable view.
The labels in the view are incomplete on the first letter and the scrolling doesn't work.
As soon as I released the mouse or stop using the rolling button on the mouse, the view jumps at the previous location.
It is difficult to explain what happens exactly.
I also don't have reproducable steps.
It happens in an erratic and unpredicatable way.
I didn't get this behavior with previous integration builds.
