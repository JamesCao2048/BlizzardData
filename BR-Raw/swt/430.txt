NPE when changing iFrame url via SWT browser evaluate() method
Build Identifier: SWT 3.5.2.v3557f
We are developing a an app that leverages iFrames to manage a collection of different pieces of browser content and are trying to dynamically manage the separate iFrame data with a call from the SWT browser evaluate() method to a javascript method we have created to change the iFrames in the browser.
When testing this we ran into NPE's quite quickly after attempting to make the call several times in a row.
Here is the stack we are getting:

The line generating the NPE is this a de-reference of the "script" variable that is passed into the Mozilla.execute() method. In this specific case execute it called by the OnStateChange method with a null due to the fact that the specific function that the code is attempting to "re-install" does not have a functionString defined because it appears to be an internal function and for whatever reason it was not assigned a functionString value when it was dynamically created.
I will attach a simple testcase based on Snippet308 that can be used to recreate the problem.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Import the attached snippet project into your workspace
2. Place the offers.html file into a dir on your PC (defaults to c:/tempy )
3. If the location of the offers.html is not c:/tempy then update the test code to point to the location on your PC where you placed it.
2. Run ( SWT snippet )
3. When the UI appears click on the button on the right called "Change UrL". You will see that yahoo is loaded in to the browser frame on the left.
4. Click this button several more times and your application will crash with the exception provided.
While this may seem to be a strange case, it is an important piece of our application and is critical for us. When this NPE is generated we hav
