WinCE/SH4: Arrow keys don't generate key events
We have a machine running WindowsCE on an SH4 that has a full keyboard and
mouse, based on a customer configuration.  The customer has reported (and we
have verified) that certain key events are not getting propagated by SWT on
this platform.
In the following testcase, key events fire for the letter keys, but no key
events are fired for the arrow keys.
