Display.gdkEventWidgets leaks widgets
RC2, SWT/UI from HEAD, Linux 2.6.4, KDE 3.2.2, GTK+ 2.4.1

I believe this variable is leaking references to widgets.  I'm not sure of the
expected life cycle of the elements in this list, but it seems to be holding on
to objects longer than expected.

For example, opening a new workbench window and closing the old workbench
window can leave references to disposed widgets in this list.  Perhaps on
dispose, a widget should check to see if it is in the list (and remove itself,
if so).
