StyledText slow to update due to deferred flushing
I20100511-0800
The content of a StyledText doesn't keep up with your keystrokes. You can see this in CustomControlExample.
1. Launch CustomControlExample.
2. Switch to StyledText.
3. Check the HORIZONTAL_FILL and VERTICAL_FILL checkboxes.
4. Start typing at a fast pace.
The text doesn't appear immediately. It seems to take a fraction of a second for the text you just typed in to repaint. Compare with a multiline Text, where there is no noticeable delay after typing.
