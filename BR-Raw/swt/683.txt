Eclipse hangs while using FileDialog
Eclipse always hangs when I attempt to import any project/archive. Infact, UI freezes when any filedialog is opened.
Suprisingly, when I tried to recreate the problem using standalone SWT (referencing to SWT jar files of the eclipse installation), FileDialog does not cause eclipse to hang.
