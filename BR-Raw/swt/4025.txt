StyledText - Tab does not tab out of read-only
Build 20020515
- Help / About
- select a portion of the about text (this is a read-only StyledText)
- hit Tab
- it does not go to the next control
Since Tab has no effect on the StyledText content since it is read-only, it
should do tab traversal.
Note that we are working around this post 20020515 by using a traverse listener.
If this is fixed, please let us know so we can remove this workaround.
