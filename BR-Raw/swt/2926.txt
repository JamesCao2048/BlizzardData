Painting problems using latest builds
Our canvas does not paint using the latest builds of Eclipse.
Reverting to M5,
everything works normally.
I am trying to find a test case, but any comments on what has changed might help
me narrow it down.
To reproduce, checkout draw2d.examples and draw2d from CVS, Tools repository,
and run HelloWorld.
