StyledText does not handle case where printing not supported
StyledText$Printing() assumes that printer.getPrinterData will return a non-
null value.  On machines where printing is not supported (or a printer is not
installed) this is not true.
Run Test_org_eclipse_swt_custom_StyledText.test_print on GTK or Mac and you
will get an NPE.
The test case and StyledText need to be modified to handle the case where no
printer or printing support is available.
