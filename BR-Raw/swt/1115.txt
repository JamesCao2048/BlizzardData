Toolbar combo box multiple glitches
The combo menu item in the toolbar has a few problems.
Run Control Example
Go to Toolbar tab
Click on 'Combo child'
* There's what looks like a straight line to the right of the combo box e.g. [   V]- <- bit of line on right (closer inspection suggests that this is in fact the SWT.SEPARATOR overflowing; it's more visible in SWT.VERTICAL than SWT.HORIZONTAL)
* The combination 'SWT.HORIZONTAL' and not 'SWT.RIGHT' causes a break-up of the 'text and image' menu choice
* Using 'SWT.VERTICAL' with the image toolbar shows just the drop-down and a few pixels of choice width; I would expect it to expand
* Using 'SWT.VERTICAL' causes the combo box to appear extended; in addition causing the warning below
* A warning is printed:
"2007-11-25 21:34:58.369 java[9610:10b] This application is trying to draw a very large combo box, 51 points tall.  Vertically resizable combo boxes are not supported, but it happens that 10.4 and previous drew something that looked kind of sort of okay.  The art in 10.5 does not break up in a way that supports that drawing.  To avoid breaking existing apps, NSComboBox in 10.5 will use the 10.4 art for large combo boxes, but it won't exactly match the rest of the system.  This application should be revised to stop using large combo boxes.  This warning will appear once per app launch."
PS Let me know if you want screenshots for the above
