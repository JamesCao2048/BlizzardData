TVT3.1 #38 - RUS mnemonics only work in main window
Note:  assigned to UI but not sure
Russian mnemonics only work in the main window menu and submenus.
To reproduce:
1) Start Eclipse with Russian langpack and switch to Russian keyboard layout.
Try mnemonics for the main menu (Alt+&#1060;, Alt+&#1055;, Alt+&#1053;, Alt+&#1047;, Alt+&#1054;, Alt+&#1057;).
Should work fine.
2) Open any other window like Project creation wizard or Preferences window
(Window > Preferences).
Try mnemonics for the window controls.
Don't work.
You can find the language pack with Russian here:
