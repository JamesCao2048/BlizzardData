whole OS freezes when tree using owner draw renders BORDER_DOT rectangle around long line
Build Identifier: 20100218-1602
When using regular expression and a long line (> 10k) is matched the computer freezes when eclipse tries to display it in the search view. A hard restart is required.
The problem is not with the long line itself but the long matched region. The OS freezes at the moment of expanding the found match - just after the search completes.
I have stumbled upon the issue by searching in a project containing minified JS files. One of the files by chance matched the regular expression.
This is a major issue since the user can't recover and it is not limited to eclipse only as the whole OS locks up.
Tried it in Windows 2000, XP, Vista on different computers, happens even in Virtual PC. VMWare 6.5 locks as well but recovers after a couple of minutes.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a file containing a single long line (15K)
2.Open File Search
3.Type ".*" in "Containing text"
4.Check regular expression checkbox
5.Type the file name for filter in "File name patterns"(the long file should be first match)
5.Click search
