Clicking on the button frame does not activate toolitem's drop down
For toolitems created with SWT.DROP_DOWN, the menu appears if the click occurs
within the bounds of the arrow itself.  However, these bounds do not include the
right hand side of the button frame.  I hit this a lot in eclipse, where I'd
like to open the menu for the Run toolitem, but I end up launching the last
application instead.
The attached patch modifies the bounds checking to count the frame as being part
of the arrow's area.
