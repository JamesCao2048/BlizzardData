Certain Images copied from Lotus Notes and pasted using SWT's Clipboard are corrupted
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
I can only reproduce this with a few images that were emailed to me in Lotus Notes.
I do not know their format.
If I upload the image, this bug is not reproducible, therefore, to reproduce, I'll need to forward an email to a developer who is using Notes.
Then copy the image in the email, and paste using the SWT Clipboard example.
You'll see that the image is corrupted (it's almost as if its an offset problem
- the width seems shifted).
I have pasted this image into other programs, including Lotus Notes, Word, and some freeware image utilities, and they are not corrupted when I paste there.
