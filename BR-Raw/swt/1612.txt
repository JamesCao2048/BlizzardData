SWT Table: PaintItem events not sent for items with empty text on Mac OS X
Look at snippet 236 (titled "draw different foreground colors for text in a TableItem") from the SWT snippets page ( http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet236.java?view=co ).
The snippet shows how to create a custom paint for a table with multiple fonts.
The snippet works fine on Windows, but on Mac OS X it gives an empty table with no items.
The listener to PaintItem is not being called.
This is due to the fact that the items are empty.
Changing line 38 in the following manner solves the problem in the snippet and demonstrates the problem:
From: new TableItem(table, SWT.NONE);
To: new TableItem(table, SWT.NONE).setText(" ");
At the very least, the snippet should be fixed.
However, it is clear that this is a bug.
PS.
Item was found on OS X 10.4.11.
