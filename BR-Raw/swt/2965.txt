GTK+ 2.2 requests data from non-visible rows of a VIRTUAL table
Because the fixed_height_mode property is not supported until GTK+ 2.2,
GtkTreeView requests all rows to perform validation.  Virtual tables can
probably get a good speed boost by returning some dummy data until the row
actually becomes visible, rather than going and asking the application for the
data too early.
