Linux GTK and TableEditor Failure Assertion
TableEditor seems not to work in the SWT 3232 build (Eclipse 3.2 RC3).
The attached snippet shows the problem.
Double clicking on a value item and then pressing any key (for editing the field) leads to the following error:
(Gecko:5704): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed
