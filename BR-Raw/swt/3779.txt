New file wizard freezes Eclipse UI
2.1 RC1
- Build id: 200302211557
Create a new text file using the "New File" wizard (File->New->File).
When the text editor opens, the UI seems to be frozen.
The main menu still works (using both mouse and keyboard), you can do anything, but the window area does not respond to user interaction anymore.You have to close Eclipse and start again.
Creating a new Java class works fine (no freezing).
Opening existing text files also works fine.
