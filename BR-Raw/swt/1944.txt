Browser widget now has border
I20070731-0800
In earlier releases and 3.4 up to last week had no border in the Browser widget. Now there is a border which makes Javadoc hovers look awful. Also Javadoc view looks bad. Works fine under Linux.
Please revert that change for M1.
Test Case:
1. run Snippet128 with R3.3 or I20070724-0800 ==> no border
2. run Snippet128 with I20070731-0800 ==> border
