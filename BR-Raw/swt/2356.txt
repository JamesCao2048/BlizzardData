Draw2d Graphics line style setting not consistent
Attached is a simple lightweight draw2d app which tries to draw a line with the
LINE_DASHDOT style, JOIN_ROUND and CAP_ROUND, but it doesn get drawn properly.
Is there a specific order in which the line styles should be set? Similar SWT
code works fine.
