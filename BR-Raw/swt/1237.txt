[mac] Mylyn notifications create an empty ghost shell under Cocoa port
Testing out Mylyn under Cocoa. Launched into a new workspace and created my first query. Upon synching each notification popup spawned a ghost shell with it. Could be a bug in the Cocoa port, could be something wrong in Mylyn that's exposed in Cocoa - I'm not sure yet. Will try produce a snippet.
