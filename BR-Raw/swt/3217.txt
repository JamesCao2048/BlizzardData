GC.drawRoundRectangle/GC.fillRoundRectangle
the arcWidth and arcHeight arguments of GC.drawRoundRectangle and
GC.fillRoundRectangle are spec'd as "the horizontal[vertical] diameter of the
arc at the four corners". The Windows implementation actually draws the corners
with a radius, not a diameter, of arcWidth and arcHeight.
