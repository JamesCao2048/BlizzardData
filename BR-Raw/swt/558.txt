org.eclipse.swt.custom.PopupList - should be able to set the SWT.H_SCROLL style on the List widget
Build Identifier: M20080911-1700
When using org.eclipse.swt.custom.PopupList, their is no method or argument in the constructor to set the style of the List widget. More importantly I can't set the SWT.H_SCROLL style on the List widget, it only has SWT.V_SCROLL.
This bug is blocking a core feature in our product where the customer cannot see the list of values if the values are very long. Even the tooltip doesn't wrap.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look in the constructor of org.eclipse.swt.custom.PopupList
2. Notice when it instantiates the List widget it hardcodes the style with no SWT.H_SCROLL
