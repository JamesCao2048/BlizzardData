Focus gets stuck in Expandbar
Run Snippet223
When example first comes up, focus is in the item header and you can not tab out of it.
Place focus in the Spinner.
Tab around.
Focus goes to the header and gets stuck there.
If you do the same thing on Wiindows, tabbing takes you both to the item headers and to the widgets inside.
