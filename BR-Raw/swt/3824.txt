Outliner: focus causes select causes horizontal scroll
Build: F1
Create a java project
Create a java package named a.really.longish.name.that.exhibits.the.bug
Create a java class named Foo in a.really.longish.name.that.exhibits.the.bug
Notice that the outliner selects the package name, and scrolls it.  Now I can't
see the icons that help me determine the type of the element.
This appears to only happen the first time I open an editor.
I would expect the icons to be displayed as well as the name when the auto
selection occurs.
