[build] Dependency on libstdc++.so.5
The swt-mozilla library depends on the libstdc++ library.  Currently, we are
compiling against libstdc++.so.5 however, RHEL4 defaults to libstdc++.so.6.
We need a strategy for supporting both libstdc++.so.5 and libstdc++.so.6.
It would appear that removing the dependency on this library altogether is not
possible.
