Clicking on partially obscured tab should scroll it into view
build I20030211
You commonly get the last visible editor tab partially obscured by the scroll
arrows, making the close box inaccessible.
You have to use the context menu
to close the editor.
Either the tabs should never get obscured (the preferred solution, but there
was already a PR for this which was marked WONTFIX), or a single click on the
tab should scroll to reveal it fully.
