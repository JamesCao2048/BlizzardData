StyledText : text selection stops when mouse cursor leaves the x-axis
When the mouse-left-button is down, and as I drag to make a text selection, I drag off the x-axis of the control.   Normally the selection would continue to follow the mouse.  With StyledText, the selection only follows the mouse when the mouse cursor remains within the area of the styledtext control.
This behaviour is different from other text input's under windows, if you compare to the behaviour in your browser, or a native windows app.  It also differs from the standard SWT Text control, however that control is too limited for my needs.
Very easy to reproduce.  I posted on the swt mailing list to find a solution, and was referred that it's a bug.
Let me know if you need any more details.
Thanks.
