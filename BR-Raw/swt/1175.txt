next annotation short cut (command+.) broke
build 20090212-2000
I like to change the behaviour of next/previous annotation from the default (error, taks) to occurrences (you can use the arrow down chevron to do that).
Then I use command + "." to move to the next occurrences of a variable in a method or class.
This used to work and now is broken.
For previous annotation the shortcut is command + shift + ".", which also used to work but now it runs next annotation instead.
