[Mac] E3.x's CocoaUIEnhancer and e4's CocoaUIHandler needlessly disable the Services menu
E3.x's CocoaUIEnhancer and e4's CocoaUIHandler (which is a lightly modified CocoaUIEnhancer) disable the MacOS X "Services" menu.  It's a bit annoying when you're used to being able to invoke a service through a keyboard shortcut.
I've tried running with the disabling code removed and haven't noticed any immediate issues.  I'd like to make this permanent.
Does anybody remember the rationale for disabling the "Services" menu?
