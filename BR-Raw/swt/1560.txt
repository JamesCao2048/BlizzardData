Clicking on areas to left or right of cell editors in tree does not raise a FocusIn event for tree on vista
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
This happens only on Windows Vista
1. Have a tree with multiple columns and cell editors (use CCombo based combo box cell editors).

2. Click on the area to the left (i.e.
where twisties would appear) or right (in blank columns area) of the place where cell editors would appear.
3. Unlike in XP and other OSes, the tree does not raise a FocusIn event and become the focused widget--this causes the filter in CCombo to not pick up the event and thus not raise a FocusOut event, and thus the cell editor will not deactivate.

We are using the 3.4M5 version of the SWT plugin though.
