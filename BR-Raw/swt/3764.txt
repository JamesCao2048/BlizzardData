[Motif] Tree and Table views not getting proper selection
To reproduce: (example)
1.Open a view containing a tree or table.
2.Select an item by left clicking it once.
3.Right click (and hold) a different item to bring up a context menu.
The
context menu will contain items appropriate to the first item selected.
Noticed this behavior in CVS Repositories view, Navigator view, Package
Explorer, Task List.
