dropdown calendar of datetime widget doesn't hide
Build: Build id: I20101206-1800
Steps to reproduce:
1) Run the ControlExample
2) In the DateTime tab set the style to SWT.DATE and SWT.DROP_DOWN
3) Open the dropdown calendar
4) Switch to another application like firefox, textedit
The dropdown calendar is still visible on top of the other application.
Expected : the calendar should be hidden when we switch to another application.
A related issue: The DateTime widget should get focus when we click on the dropdown button. Because this doesn't happen, the focus is on a different control and we can traverse between different controls while the dropdown calendar is still visible.
