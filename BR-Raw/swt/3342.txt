some menus do not show their item texts
0519 integration build
- running on the Japanese machine in the swt lab, win98
- start eclipse (no translation pack, just the default download)
- open the File menu, it opens very wide and without item texts
- many of the other menus appear fine
- I don't see this problem in Arabic
I'll attach the screenshot next.
