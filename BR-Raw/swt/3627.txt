[Viewers] ITreeViewerListener.treeExpanded() is called twice
I am using TreeViewer, and my ContentProvider class also listens to tree
collapse and tree expansions in the viewer by registering itself as a
ITreeViewerListener with the TreeViewer.
It has the required methods to implement:
public void treeExpanded(TreeExpansionEvent event), and
public void treeCollapsed(TreeExpansionEvent event).
The problem is that when an item in the tree is expanded for the first time
only, treeExpanded(TreeExpansionEvent) is called twice.
treeCollapsed is only called once, as expected, and treeExpanded is only called
one upon subsequent expansions of tree items.
