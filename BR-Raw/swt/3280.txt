CoolBar with SWT.DROP_DOWN style
Run ControlExample on W2K. Also observed on WinXP.
Go to Coolbar tab
Set the DROP_DOWN style
Move a coolitem so that it partially hides another coolitem containing
the 'red circle' icon. The chevron appears normally indicating that the 'red
circle' is partially obfuscated.
- If the red circle is more than 80% covered, the chevron correctly expands to
show the full red circle item.
- If the red circle is slightly less covered (enough so that the chevron
appears), the chevron can be clicked but does not expand to the full red
circle item. This sounds like a bug to me.
Is it the desired native widget behaviour?
