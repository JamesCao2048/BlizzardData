getOffset () in emulated TextLayout.java wrong for proportional fonts
In SWT's emulated TextLayout (used in SWT/Photon and until recently in
SWT/Fox),
method 'public int getOffset (int x, int y, int[] trailing)'
<snip>
int charWidth = gc.stringExtent(String.valueOf(chars[0])).x;
</snip>
should be
<snip>
int charWidth = gc.stringExtent(String.valueOf(chars[offset])).x;
</snip>
This is on line 885, I think.
For obvious reasons, this bug manifests itself only when proportional (non-
monospaced) font is used, which is a rare case for the Eclipse-Java-Editor
client of StyledText.
