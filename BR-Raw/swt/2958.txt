Embedded Swing: Enter key does not work
I'm running Fedora Core 3 with all the latest updates, JDK 1.5, and the 3.1M5
GTK version of the SWT binary. For some reason, the enter key event does not
fire inside an embedded JTextPane. In case it matters, it's also inside multiple
embedded JSplitPanes. All other key events work fine.
