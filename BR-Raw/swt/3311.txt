org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control has funky color issues
I reported a bug (#65642) about some color issues. Some further experimentation
leads me to this refinement of the bug: Control objects don't seem to handle
color correctly in some instances. I've seen this problem manifested in Labels,
and a coworker has seen the same issue in a List, leading me to believe that
it's a problem in the common ancestor, Control. Of course, this makes sense
since setForeground() and setBackground() are in Control. I'll attach some
sample code to illustrate a case where it breaks for me under SWT 3.0RC1.
