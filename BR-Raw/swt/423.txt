Deadlock/Hang on UI Thread
Build Identifier: 3.6.2
Our product recently update to SWT 3.6.2 and found a hang/deadlock on a common use case for us.
We did some digging and found it was caused by the fix for  bug 322137 .

We have a Shell that we display that uses style SWT.ON_TOP.
An Eclipse action is run that calls MessageBox and the result is the user can never click on the OK button in the MessageBox.
Due to the complexity of the product, I was able to reproduce the issue by creating a sample project.
The project consists of piecing together SWT Snippet fragments, resulting in a flow that does not really make sense but does reproduce the problem.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run the Snippet50.java class in the project that will be attached.
2.Note how you cannot click the OK button on the MessageBox that is displayed.
