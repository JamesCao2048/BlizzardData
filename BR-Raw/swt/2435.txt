[64] SWT Snippet24 (default selection) does not work on amd64
I am using an AMD 64bit machine and Eclipse 3.2M6 on linux_gtk.
I run the SWT snippet 24 and pressing CR in either the text field or combo does nothing.
My actual code used the same technique in order to listen for default selection events on text fields and it worked on 3.2M5 on a 32bit linux_gtk system.
The same code did fail on 3.2M4 and 3.2M6 on a 64bit linux_gtk system (the default selection part).
