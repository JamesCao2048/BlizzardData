Sync view toolbar buttons are bigger with SWT manifest
I started using the SWT manifest so I could take screenshots.
The toolbar
buttons in the sync view are quite a bit bigger than they were (and other
view's button's are not).
It could be related to the use of a view subtitle.
Is this the intented behavior?
