Constructor for Font has wrong-named argument; doesn't appear to be used
In the source for 3.0M7 SWT, I came across the following Font constructor:
public Font(Device display, String name, int height, int style) {
if (device == null) device = Device.getDevice();
if (device == null) SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_NULL_ARGUMENT);
init(device, name, height, style);
}
Firstly, the arg name 'display' corresponds to a 'Device' object (which confused me when I called it,
since the pop-up control listed the argument as 'display'), and secondly, it doesn't appear to be used in
the code snippet at all.
I'm guessing that it should be 'device', as otherwise, it doesn't matter what arg you pass it, it's always
going to find the instance field 'device' as null, then obtain the default one.
