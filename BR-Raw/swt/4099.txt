CTabFolder flashing tooltip
Windows 2000
F1
Place cursor at very bottom edge of CTabFolder tabs.  Tooltip appears but then
mouse enters the tooltip which means it leaves the CTabFolder and the tooltip
closes.  Repeats until you move the mouse up.  Note this can also be a problem
if tabs are on bottom of folder.
