Safari - Open Link in New Window does not load link in new window
When using the internal browser on Cocoa, right-clicking on a link and selecting the 'Open Link in New Window' spawns a new blank window but loads the link in the originating window.
On Carbon a new window would spawn and the link would load in the new window.
