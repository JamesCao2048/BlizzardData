AIX Table performance problem
I'm having a performance problem with tables on AIX.
I have a table in a view with 30 or so table
columns filled with 4,000 rows of data.
I have the ability for a user to select a format file for the table
that changes which columns of the data are displayed without hiding the view.
I do this by disposing
the TableColumns and creating new TableColumns based on the format data.
When I tested this on OS
X (PowerBook G4 500 MHz) the performance was perfectly acceptable.
When I moved the code to AIX
(Power3 350 MHz I think) the performance was hideous.
