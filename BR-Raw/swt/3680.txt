Index out of bounds from Combo.select()
The Javadoc for the org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo.select() methods says that
indecies that are out of range are ignored by on the Mac platform I get the
following exception:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Index out of bounds
at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:2318)
at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:2262)
at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.error(Widget.java:506)
at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo.select(Combo.java:1155)
I found the following line in the source code, which I assume is where the
exception is being thrown:
if (0 > index || index >= count) error (SWT.ERROR_INVALID_RANGE);
This causes the Mac platform to behave differently then other platforms and
from the way the document says it should work.
