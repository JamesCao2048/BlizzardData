Buttons and text in a table cell editor are not sized small enough on the Mac
Eclipse 3.0 RC1
The ColorCellEditor has problems on OS X - the button to activate the color dialog box
does not fit withing the cell, and clicking the button will not activate the color dialog box most of the
time.  Pressing return will always activate the color dialog box.
