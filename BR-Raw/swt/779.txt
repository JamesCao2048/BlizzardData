Can't restore column widths
Build id: I20090430-2300
There is a problem with resizing columns, consider the steps:
1. Select a shared file
2. Team > History Show
3. Going from "Revision" to "Author" set widths to be zero
Result:
4. The only column visible is "Comment"
5. You can show the "Revision" column by grabbing the border
5. There is no way to show columns between "Revision" and "Comment"
