[Viewers] Treeview expand/collapse ignores somewhat quick + and - clicks (doubleclicks)
- eclipse-SDK-3.2-win32.zip
- Windows XP
- Sun JDK 1.5.0
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0-b64)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0-b64, mixed mode)
Clicking on + then
- in a tree view ignores successive clicks if they are less than about half a second apart.
This is not a problem in native Windows (Windows explorer, for example).
Fixing this makes applications seem more responsive and improves the user experience.
One example scenario would be missing with the mouse and expanding the wrong tree, then collapsing it immediately to expand the right one.
To reproduce:
- Start Eclipse 3.2
- Create a Java project, or go to Window->Show View->Other...
- Rapidly click on the +/- to expand and collapse a tree.
Notice how rapid successive clicks are ignored.
