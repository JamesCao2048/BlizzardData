Unable to select any window when JFace warning dialog and file browse dialog are both open
Build Identifier: 3.4.2.M20090107-0800
If you open the preference page, then from there click on a Browse button to open a file browser dialog, then trigger some event that causes an org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.MessageDialog.openWarning() call to happen, you end up with a warning dialog under the file browser, and neither one can actually be clicked on, thus causing a locking situation. The user must force quit the application. There does not seem to be an appropriate SWT style that will allow a dialog like this to be on top of a File Browser or similar system level dialog (such as the Font picker).
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a preference page that has a Browse... button on it. Click it to open a file browser dialog
2. With that dialog open, call org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.MessageDialog.openWarning()
3. Two windows are open, neither one can be dismissed. Must force quit the application.
