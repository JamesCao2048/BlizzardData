Dialogs block the execution of (a)syncExecs
Hello..
I surprisingly noticed that opening PrintDialog, FileDialog and DirectoryDialog
block the execution of Runnables posted by syncExec() and asyncExec().
On the
other hand, the ones posted by timerExec() are still executed!
SWT(3138)..
what's wrong?
best regards
