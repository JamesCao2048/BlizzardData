DND actions in AbstractTreeViewer lead to NPE and application freeze [Carbon]
Build Identifier: M20110210-1200
I noticed lately that a big, serious, crashing Eclipse NPE occurs on DND actions in a SWT Tree in the Carbon version of our RCP application.
I traced it to one point in AbstractTreeViewer.
This wasn't happening before.
So I checked if it was happening in Eclipse Carbon version itself.
Yes it does.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Package Explorer create some simple files and folders in a General Project.
2.DND some files between folders.
Try and do this a few times.
Leads to NPE.
