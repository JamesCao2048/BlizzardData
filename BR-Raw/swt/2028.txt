I20070508-0800
See the screenshots in  Bug 168295 .
Some users in Windows XP classic mode are losing  alpha channels when we combine images in the Package Explorer.
This does not occur in Windows XP default theme.
This is currently not consistently happening to all machines but there are certain ones in happens on frequently.
marking as major as this is pretty common for people with the old themes.
