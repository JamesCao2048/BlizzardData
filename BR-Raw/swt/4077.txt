Cannot select a non-bold font
Build 20020521
Linux-GTK
1. Go in the font selection dialog "Window->Preferences->Workbench->Fonts->Text
Font->Change..."
2. Select the font you want.
3. Click 'OK'
Even if the font you selected was not a bold font, the font display in the
preview is a bold font and the name of the font is *-bold-*
