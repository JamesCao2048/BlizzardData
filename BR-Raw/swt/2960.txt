View toolbars are showing with black backgrounds
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050412-1547
The background of all view local toolbars is black.  When I change my theme to
standard XP one (Luna) the problem goes away.  This problem didn't exist in the
previous I build.
The black makes it very hard to concentrate :)
