Spinner.setDigits triggers a SWT.Selection Event on Linux and not on Windows
Build Identifier: 20100218-1602
In Windows, calling setDigits() on a spinner does not fire any event. This is not the case on Linux. The attached JUnit test highlights the bug, this event should not be triggered when calling setDigits().
This makes our product working differently in Windows and Linux.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a spinner.
2.Call setDigits(XX)
3.On Windows, the event is not fired. What is fine.
4.On Linux, the event is fired. Here is the bug.
