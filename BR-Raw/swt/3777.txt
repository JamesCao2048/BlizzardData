confirm exit checkbox cannot be selected
RC2
- start Eclipse
- try to shut it down by clicking its Close decoration in the top-right corner
- a "Confirm Exit" prompter is shown, with a "Don't show this prompter anymore"
checkbox
- click the checkbox and note that it can't be checked, so you can only press
OK or Cancel from here
- this doesn't happen elsewhere, so there must be something special about
either this prompter or its invocation from a window-close request
