Steps To Reproduce:
Sample code provided.
See attached screenshots to see results of code on both WinXP and MacOSX.
More information:
addArc on OS X *seems* to always start the arc at the same place, rather than as instructed.
I.e.
it always draws the arc clockwise, even when instructed to draw it anticlockwise.
By contrast, on WinXP, the behaviour is consistent and predictable.
