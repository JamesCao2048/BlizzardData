Focus not restored properly when breadcrumb bar is used
Focus is not being set/restored properly when using the breadcrumb bar.
This is fallout from  bug 330749  - Markus found this bug while using the N20101201 build.
- In a Java Editor, enable the breadcrumb (e.g. Navigate > Show in Breadcrumb)
- click the last black arrow in the breadcrumb
- click another member
=> focus is in the main toolbar; should be in the editor's text area

When you set a breakpoint to Control#setFocus() with hit count 2, you see that
the focus goes to the StyledText (it was on the breadcrumb tree before). Then
set an access&modification breakpoint on Decorations#savedFocus and resume.
When that breakpoint is hit, you see that Shell#windowDidResignKey() is called
on the workbench window, and this destroys the contents of savedFocus for that
shell.
