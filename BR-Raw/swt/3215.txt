Table Redraw freezes the Table Headers on CE
setRedraw(false) and a later setRedraw(true) freezes the tables headers and
they don't scroll any longer with the table cell (this works correct). To
reproduce you really only need to call setRedraw with "false" and then
directly "true" and the freeze is there.
