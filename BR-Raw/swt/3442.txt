[SWT Examples] Setting the style to SWT.FLAT has no effect on Buttons
When I was going through the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples-
3.0M7.zip) which I downloaded from
http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse -
examples-3.0M7.zip on Solaris 9 and HP-UX 11.11, I realized that setting the
style of a Button to SWT.FLAT had no effect on its appearance on the screen.
Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario:
1. Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11.
2. Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from
http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse -
examples-3.0M7.zip and install them.
3. Launch Eclipse
4. Select 鈥淲indow -> Show View -> Other鈥︹. This will launch the 鈥淪how View鈥
Dialog.
5. From the 鈥淪how View鈥 Dialog, select 鈥淪WT Examples -> SWT Controls鈥. This
will display 鈥淪WT Controls鈥 View.
6. From SWT Controls View, select 鈥淏utton鈥 tab.
7. In the 鈥淪tyles鈥 group, make sure SWT.FLAT option is unchecked and SWT.PUSH
is checked.
Expected Behavior: The Buttons look similar to the
image 鈥渇lat_unchecked_on_3.0M7.jpg鈥
8. Check option SWT.FLAT in the 鈥淪tyles鈥 group.
Expected Behavior: The Buttons should look similar to the
image 鈥渇lat_checked_on_2.1.2.jpg鈥
Important: 鈥渇lat_checked_on_2.1.2.jpg鈥 shows the appearance of the Buttons
when SWT.FLAT is applied on the Eclipse 2.1.2 examples on the Eclipse 2.1.2
workbench.
Actual Behavior: The appearance of the Buttons does not change. They still
appear the same way they did before SWT.FLAT was applied. See image
flat_checked_on_3.0M7.jpg
Important: When I ran the same tests on the Examples of Eclipse 2.1.2 on the
Eclipse 2.1.2 workbench, the effect of setting SWT.FLAT on Buttons was
visible. A snapshot of the appearance of Buttons is shown in
figure 鈥渇lat_checked_on_2.1.2.jpg鈥. However, when it comes to Eclipse 3.0M7,
SWT.FLAT option seems to have no effect on Buttons.
