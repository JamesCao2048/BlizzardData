Selection under cocoa draws wrong in wrapped TextLayout
Build Identifier: I20100608-0911
Using SWT cocoa, a TextLayout with wrapped text where the first line is smaller than the others, the selection is drawn as a box with the width of the first line.
This causes text on the other lines to leak out of the selection background box.
The attached screen shot shows the result of the attached java code with the selection bug.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Run the attached Test.java under mac os x with cocoa window system.
