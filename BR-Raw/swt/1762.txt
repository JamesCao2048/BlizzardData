[Browser] Stop calling HIJavaViewCreateWithCocoaView
Build ID: n/a
Steps To Reproduce:
The SWT calls HIJavaViewCreateWithCocoaView to create an HIView that embeds an AWT frame. While it's now just a pass-through to HICocoaViewCreate, it's still SPI, so new work that is Leopard-only (like the Cocoa port) should not use it. Use HICocoaViewCreate instead.
