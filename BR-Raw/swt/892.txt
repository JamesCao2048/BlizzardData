Cocoa:Verify Listener not called on selecting items in Combo
Build ID: I20090528-2000 : 3.5RC3
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Launch the snippet 289.It uses a verify listener to verify that the selected item has numbers.
2.In the dropdown select "aaaa"
3."aaaa" should not be selected.
But, aaaa gets selected because the Verify Listener  is not called on selecting the items in the Combo.
Expected: Combo should send SWT.Verify event on selecting the items of the Combo.
More information:
Verify event is sent on typing new text in the Combo.
Works fine on Carbon.
