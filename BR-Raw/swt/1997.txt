Can't enter paths in Text fields on Red Hat Workstation 5
Build ID: RC1
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Fire up RC1 on linux / rhws5 / x86_64
2.Create a new project
3.File
-> Import
-> General
-> File System
4.Try to enter a path in the "From directory" Text field.
More information:
Looks like every character that's entered is immediately selected which leads to the problem that the next character which is entered is not appended but replaces the previous.
One CAN unselect the character and enter the next one.
Browsing with the native dialog seems to work.
