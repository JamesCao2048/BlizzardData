Allow developers to remove title bar buttons (Close, Minimize, and Zoom) from application-modal
dialogs on Mac OS X.
According to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines,
"Most application-modal dialogs do not have the standard title bar controls (close, minimize, zoom);
the user dismisses these dialogs by clicking a push button, such as OK or Cancel."
