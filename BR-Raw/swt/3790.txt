Quick release upon start of drag hangs eclipse with pointer grab
Reproducing this may take a few attempts, but for some reason I have to kill
eclipse several times a day because of this one.
0) make sure several tree lists are visible
1) select something in a tree list
2) start and drag in another tree list and immediately release the mouse button
3) eclipse hangs on the pointer grab.
Thankfully it isn't a keyboard grab as well, so I am still able to switch to a
virtual terminal to kill the sucker.
NOTE: to diagnose this one you will probably want to start eclipse from a
debugger running on the console rather than inside X, because of the pointer
grab!  Starting it in a separate X session from the debugger will do the trick
as well.
