SWT crashes with KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE on mac
I wrote a small SWT stand alone program which crashes every time on MacOS X.
The same program work flawlessly on Microsoft Windows platforms.  To recreate,
run the test program, resize the window that appears, wait a few seconds and
then you will get the fatal exception.
