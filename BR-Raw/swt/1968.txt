Wrong positioning when going off end-of-line
When editing a java file and positioning the cursor before the last character
and then pressing right-cursor twice (making the cursor go to the beginning of
the next line) and then pressing up-cursor positions the cursor at the end of
the previous line, while it should position it at the beginning of the
previous line.
It doesn't happen on every line, but almost every line.
