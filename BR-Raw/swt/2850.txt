Typeahead broken for Table and Tree
I20050215-2300
The native GTK+ typeahead feature is not working on Table and Tree, but is
working for List.  It seems that either the order of the columns in our model,
or the number of columns, is causing GTK+ to be unable to tell which is the
correct column to use.
The fix is to use gtk_tree_view_set_search_column() ourselves to indicate which
column should be searched.  The attached patch works but there are some open issues:
1. Will the column number I am using always be correct?  Could this constant
be stored somewhere better?
2. The documentation indicates that this function has been there forever,
but that it "turns on interactive searching".  Should we not set this value
for GTK+ versions before 2.6, where interactive searching was not on by
default?
