[browser] investigate support for custom popup menu
The Browser widget for 3.0 has the following behaviour:
1. By default, expose the native popup menu if the embedded native browser
exposes one (at the moment, this applies to IE only. Other browsers don't
provide a 'free' default one). No custom menu can be set or modified on any
platform.
2. allow apps to block the default popup menu by catching the SWT.MenuDetect
event and setting the field event.doit to false.
Scenario 1 is for people using the Browser to navigate HTML documents.
Scenario 2 is for people using the Browser to render a portion of HTML and
don't want the user to access the actions from the default popup menu.
This behaviour is also consistent with the way the native Text widget provide
a default popup menu.
