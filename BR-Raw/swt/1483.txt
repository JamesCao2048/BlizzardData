SWT deletes libswt-cairo-motif if libcairo isn't found
Build ID: M20080221-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Compile all the SWT libraries, including libswt-cairo-motif (which requires libcairo to be present)
2. Remove libcairo or make sure your SWT run won't find it.
3. Run a snippet like Snippet10 which will fail with an error because it can't find libcairo.
Make sure it is using the new SWT libraries (-Dswt.library.path should be set).
4. Notice that it deleted the libswt-cairo-motif library you built earlier.

Although I've seen this problem on AIX with Motif, it may affect other platforms as well.
