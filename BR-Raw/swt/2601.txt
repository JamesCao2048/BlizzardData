Reduce matching complexity of the SWT flat toolbar RC style
The documentation for GtkRC indicates that "*" characters in GTK+ RC files slow down widget creation.
Currently we match against:
"*swt-toolbar-flat*"
This can be reduced to:
"*.swt-toolbar-flat"
and still work, but with reduced complexity.
