Add API to access the application menu (Mac) and system menu (win32/gtk)
On the Mac developers want control over the application menu.
They want to set the about menu text, enable/disable/hide the preferences item, and add items to the application menu.
They also want to listen for selections on those items.
In other words, treat it like any other Menu in the application.
Likewise, on Win32 or Linux, you can access the system menu of a window and listen to each of its items, as well as add items to the menu.
On the Mac the only way to do this right now is via the eAWT package from Apple.
This works correctly now, in 3.7, but using it loads the AWT, which shouldn't be necessary just to listen to some menu items that the SWT creates anyway.
On Windows or GTK the system menu is not accessible without going to the PI.
I know it can be done on Win32 as we already modify it for TOOL and child windows.
We don't do it in GTK but I'm pretty sure I saw API somewhere to get at the system menu.
