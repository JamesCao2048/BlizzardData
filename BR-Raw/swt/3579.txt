ImageAnalyzer example failed to read PNG file.
I attempted to feed the attached file to the image analyzer example and got an error dialog that
said "Error loading file ...
i/o error (java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException: 0):
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException: 0".
Suspect this is a problem with the PNG reader.
