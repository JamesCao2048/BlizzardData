FontDialog needs FontData[] API
FontDialog's open() and setFontData() methods are the only way to
receive/provide FontData for specifying a font.
But on motif, Fonts are often
made up of multiple FontDatas.
Now that there's a Font constructor that takes FontData[], the dialog should
really be extended to also receive/provide FontData[] when needed.
This is
particularly important in locales like chinese and japanese.
