Form Layout behaviour has changed between 3.0 and 3.1
I have a wizard that uses FormLayout to place it's controls.
This class was
created in the 2.1 days and has worked fine until now.
I just installed M6 and
now the layout is wrong.
(I will attach screenshots).

Observed behaviour: as I add controls to a FormLayout the padding at the top
gets larger and larger.
