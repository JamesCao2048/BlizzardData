[Perspectives] MenuManager.update() causes menu to be redrawn too often
When I change perspective 9 times, MenuManager.updateAll() is called 9 times.
MenuManager.update(force,recursive) ends up being called 78 times.
While removing the included obsolete menu items, mi[i].dispose() causes a
redraw of the menu for each dispose, happening 162 times.
MenuItem.dispose
-> MenuItem.releaseChild
-> Menu.destroyItem
-> Menu.redraw.
Menu.redraw is called 162 time and 4.1% of perspective switching is spent here.
MenuManager.updateAll should contain code to say menu.setRedraw(false), do all
the removals, and then do menu.setRedraw(true);
As an aside, WorkbenchWindow.updateActionBars() uses 16.5% of CPU.
Of that, MenuManager.updateAll() uses 15.1% and CoolbarManager.update() only
1.3%
