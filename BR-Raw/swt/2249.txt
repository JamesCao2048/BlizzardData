org.eclipse.swt.custom.ControlEditor.computeBounds() is package private
Suppose I've developed a custom SWT control called Grid, which is an
alternative to the Table control.
To support in-place cell editing, I would
like to also develop a GridEditor, which should be similar in spirit to the
existing org.eclipse.swt.custom.TableEditor.
My GridEditor should inherit from
ControlEditor in order to reuse the code that tracks the scrollbars of the
Grid control (which is a Composite, after all).
However, I cannot do that, because in my GridEditor class I *have* to override
ControlEditor.computeBounds(), which should calculate the bounds of the in-
place editing control according to the Grid's notion of cell bounds.
It looks like the single method in ControlEditor, computeBounds() which should
be protected is package protected instead..
And yes, I know I have the option of not basing my GridEditor on ControlEditor
at all, but why is then ControlEditor public at all?
