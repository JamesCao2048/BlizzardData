FileDialog should inherit image from parent shell
Hi,
I noticed that the FileDialog comes with a default icon instead to inherit
the icon from the parent shell.
And as I can see there is no way to change the
icon.
So, I think to inherit the icon should be the default behaviour.
The behaviour occurs with the GTK 3134 build.
And also occurs in the Eclipse
IDE 3.1M6(GTK) with "Open external file...".
