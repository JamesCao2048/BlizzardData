StyledText - Fix calculating of cursor level
Cursor level is broken in the following cases:
1.doBackspace(), doDelete().
Expected behavior: cursor level is set to the level of the deleted character.
Actual behavior: cursor level is set to the level of the preceding character.
2.doLineStart(), doLineEnd().
Expected: cursor level is derived from the paragraph level.
Actual: cursor level is derived from the level of the first/last character.
Suggested solution: cache cursor level in the above methods.
