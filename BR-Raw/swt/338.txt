[Mac] GLCanvas draws on top of fast views
Build Identifier: 20110218-0911
GLCanvas cannot be occluded by fast views, it just draws happily on top of them.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1) Launch the IDE product including the 2 attached plugins (org.lwjgl and testcase).
2) Show the "Bug View" from the "Bug Category". The canonical spinning torus example should appear in a view.
3) Minimize another view and then reveal it such that it overlaps the bug view... the GLCanvas of the bug view keeps drawing the torus on top of the fast view.
