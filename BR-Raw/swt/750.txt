[OLE] Menus dissapear when opening/closing a RAC view with embedded MS Word 2007 (using OleControlSite)
Build Identifier: I20090611-1540 (Version: 3.5.0)
Try creating a new RAC View with embedded MS Word 2007.  Using the OleControlSite object in order to do that.  In the application, when opening this view, the application menus dissapear.  If trying to set the application menus on the OleFrame object, then when opening the view the menus are there.  But when closing the view, the menus in the application dissapear as well.
Problem:  opening and closing the view, shouldn't dispose of the whole application menus.
(example code in the attachments)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new View extending ViewPart
2. In createPartControl method, create the OleFrame object and the OleControlSite object with embedded word document.

4. Instead of step 3. -> set the application menus from the workbench on the OleFrame object.
5. Run the RAC application, open this view -> notice that the application menus are there and working.
6. Close the view -> notice that the application menus have dissapeared.
