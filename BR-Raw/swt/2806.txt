"Selection Foreground/Background Color" Preference cannot be changed for Java/Editor/Appearance
In the Preferences for Java->Editor->Appearance, you cannot change the
"Selection Foreground Color" from the default. When you uncheck the "System
Default" checkbox, and choose a color, your color selection is ignored.
