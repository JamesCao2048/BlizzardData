Changing the style of a Label from SWT.SHADOW_IN to SWT.SHADOW_NONE does not make a difference in the appearance of the Label
When I was going through the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples-
3.0M7.zip) which I downloaded from
http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse -
examples-3.0M7.zip, I realized that changing the style of a Label from
SWT.SHADOW_IN to SWT.SHADOW_NONE did not make a difference in the appearance
of the Label.
Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario:
1. Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11.
2. Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from
http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse -
examples-3.0M7.zip and install them.
3. Launch Eclipse
4. Select 鈥淲indow -> Show View -> Other鈥︹. This will launch the 鈥淪how View鈥
Dialog.
5. From the 鈥淪how View鈥 Dialog, select 鈥淪WT Examples -> SWT Controls鈥. This
will display 鈥淪WT Controls鈥 View.
6. From SWT Controls View, select 鈥淟abel鈥 tab.
7. In the 鈥淪tyles鈥 group, make sure SWT.SEPARATOR, SWT.VERTICAL and
SWT.SHADOW_IN options are checked and the rest are unchecked.
8. In the 鈥淥ther鈥 group, make sure both 鈥淓nabled鈥 and 鈥淰isible鈥 options are
checked.
9. In the 鈥淪ize鈥 group, make sure 鈥100 X 100鈥 is selected.
10. From the 鈥淪tyles鈥 group, select SWT.SHADOW_NONE option. This will uncheck
the SWT.SHADOW_IN option.
Expected Behavior: The appearance of the Labels should change
Actual Behavior: The appearance of the Labels remains unchanged
Important: When I ran the same tests on Eclipse 2.1.2, the outcome was the
same as it was on Eclipse 3.0M7.
