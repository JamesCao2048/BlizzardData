Hitting the Enter/Return key in the Find/Replace dialog doesn't do anything on Mac OS X
Eclipse 3.0 M2
Build id: 200307181617
Mac OS X 10.2.6
1) Open the Find/Replace dialog (Edit
-> Find/Replace).
2) Type in a search term into the text box.
3) Hit the return key.
Nothing happens.
Hitting the Return key should do a "Find" operation (the
same as clicking on the "Find" button, which is highlighted as the "default"
button in the Find/Replace dialog).
