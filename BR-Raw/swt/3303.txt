TrayItem not coming back after an explorer crash
It would be good if there was a way to get the tray icon back after an explorer crash.
An easy way to test it, is to open the task window, kill explorer task, and restart a new one.
Some applications manage to re-add themselves (while still avoiding flickering in normal state, and
moving in the system try, so I guess this is not 'only' a remove / readd).
Maybe there's a way to be notified when explorer starts?
Anyway, I've always refused bugs from my users about this saying that this is not SWT's problem if the
explorer crashed, and that in the first place they should complain to microsoft. I refrained from
reporting this "bug", but if there's an easy fix... (and it's easy to test / reproduce).
