Gtk Label widget has focus decoration drawn too big
Under Gtk, GC.drawFocus() draws a decoration that is one pixel
too wide and one pixel too high on Linux Gtk. This is particularly noticeable
for the Label widget, since the bottom and right edge of the decoration are
not visible.

This draws properly on win32 and Linux Motif.
