Weird focus
I20090113
A few times I have managed to get myself in a situation where eclipse was no longer the active application (the menu bar was indicating another app) but still my eclipse windows were on top and I could still click in the dialog that I had opened and the keystrokes were still routed to the application.
Note though that the dialog was not fully functional.
For example there was a tree and I could expand its node, but I could not select anything in it.
Also it was hard for me to get it back to be the active application.
No steps to reproduce this.
