Cannot middle-button paste to rxvt from Eclipse
Some applications can only deal with XA_STRING when reading from the primary
clipboard.  Currently, Eclipse only privides UTF8_STRING and COMPOUND_TEXT results.
A notable broken example is rxvt, another is xclip, and yet another is eterm.
All of these applications only handle the STRING type for middle-button paste.
The attached patch addresses this problem.
