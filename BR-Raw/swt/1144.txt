CCombo popup doesn't scroll with CCombo
Using N20090303-2000 a CCombo popup list of choices doesn't move with the CCombo if the CCombo is in an editor and the editor is scrolled vertically using the scrollbar
steps to reproduce
# open a Mylyn task editor (for Bugzilla)
# ensure that scrollbars are showing by resizing the editor if necessary
# cause one of the CCombos in the editor to show its list of choices by clicking the CCombo's button
# use the scrollbar on the editor to scroll vertically
# notice that the editor scrolls, but the CCombo popup doesn't (it remains at its original location)
