Eclipse 3.7 M1 crashes as it is starting up - detected by Java Runtime Environment
Build Identifier: I20100805-1700
Sometimes when I start Eclipse 3.7 M1 it crashes before it finishes loading up. I thought it was a openjdk or icedtea bug so I opened a bug report here:
http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=532
Unfortunately they say it is an eclipse bug.
This is what was written on the terminal when Eclipse crashed:
#
