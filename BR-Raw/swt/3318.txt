TableItem does not redraw correctly on setText(int, String)
Since RC1
When I call TableItem.setText(3, "blabla"), the table cell redraws.
However,
the first 12 pixels or so are not redrawn.
It looks like the Table thinks
the item has an image set?
I don't use images for column three.
The other
columns in my table that have images do redraw correctly.
Works fine with 3.0 build from May 25.Breaks in RC1
This is pure SWT, no jface
