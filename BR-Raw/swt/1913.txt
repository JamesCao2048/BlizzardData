StyledText.getOffsetAtLocation can't return offset at end of a line
It doesn't seem like StyledText.getOffsetAtLocation is able to return an offset corresponding to the end of a line.
This is unfortunate, because for any offset corresponding to the end of a line styledText.getOffsetAtLocation (styledText.getLocationAtOffset()) is not an identity transformation.
This also appears to prevent the StyledTextDragAndDropEffect class from positioning the cursor at the end of a line for a drop.
