MessageBox does not display default title when icon is specified
On Linux, providing an icon for a MessageBox also seems to supply a default
tilte to the MessageBox.
On Windows, this is not the case
-- the MessageBox
title is blank unless setText() is called.
The following code displays a message box with a warning icon.
On Linux, when
this displays, it will automatically have a title of "Warning", whereas on
Windows, no title will be shown unless setText(...) is called.
This behavior
happens for any icon styles.
MessageBox messageBox = new MessageBox(window.getShell(), SWT.YES | SWT.NO |
SWT.ICON_WARNING);
messageBox.setMessage("This is a warning");
messageBox.open();
Not sure which of these is correct behavior, but should be consistent.
