A simple test case that navigates to a site that can show cookies
Build ID: 3.5RC1
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Set some cookies with Browser.setCookie(xx, url)
2.Create the first instance of a browser
3.Navigate to the URL and see that the cookie is not set.
More information:
I tried with IE and XULRunner on Windows as well as XULRunner on Linux and they all fail.
It is important to be able to set cookies, because some applications may predefine a set of cookies for known domains and be unable to access them.
They would have to hack to get them set once the first instance gets created.
