TableItem.computeDisplayText does not check to see if index is greater than string
The following code in TableItem.computeDisplayText can case an IndexOutofBounds
exception:
int index = availableWidth / gc.getFontMetrics ().getAverageCharWidth ();
textWidth = gc.stringExtent (text.substring (0, index)).x;
It does stand to reason that if the availableWidth is less than the textWidth
then the resulting index from the calculation above should be less than
text.length().  The problem is that you can end up with a string that thows it
off.  In the case I am seeing, availableWidth is 159 and the textWidth is 179.
The length of the string is 25.  This would mean that the average char width is
7 ( 7.16 ).  However, getAverageCharWidth() returns 6 so therefore 159/6 = 26 (
26.5 ).  This results in the second line generating the IndexOutofBounds exception.
