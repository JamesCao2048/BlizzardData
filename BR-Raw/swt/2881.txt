Link widget with wrapped link: active area on wrong line
I20050509-2010
The Link widget has problems when a link extends over two lines.
The active area
of the part on the upper line is shifted one line down.
Clicking on the first
linked word only reveals the active area, but does not engage the link.
Looks fine on GTK, but fails on WinXP.
