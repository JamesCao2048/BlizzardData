Clipboard of GTK on KDE : Eclipse crash
When Clipboard.getAvailableTypeNames() is called
on GTK/Linux with KDE system ( not GNOME ), it causes
Eclipse platform to get crashed.
Looks like in this
function, somehow OS.gdk_atom_name(atoms[i]) returns 0
and passing 0 to OS.strlen() causes segv.
Here is how to:
1) Install the attached plugin on GTK/Linux Eclipse with
KDE.
2) Run eclipse
3) If "Try me" is not in the menu, Window > Customize
Perspective ...
> Other > Try me needs to be checked.
4) Try me > Clipboard
