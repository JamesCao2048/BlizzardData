HTMLTransfer uses UTF-16 to copy to clipboard (should use UTF-8 to be compatible with paste)
Bug 376589  fixed pasting of Unicode characters from the HTML clipboard to use UTF-8 by default (but still accepting UTF-16 with BOM).
Unfortunately, this fix breaks copy-paste inside the same SWT application when HTMLTransfer is used.
The problem is that HTMLTransfer#javaToNative(..) still uses UTF-16 but without a BOM.
This is incompatible with the new #nativeToJava(..).
http://developer.gnome.org/gtk/stable/gtk-question-index.html#id478682  says: "GTK+ uses Unicode (more exactly UTF-8) for all text."
That makes SWT's HTMLTransfer#javaToNative(..) implementation illegal.
This conditional breakpoint in HTMLTransfer line 71 fixed the bug for me:
byte[] utf8 = org.eclipse.swt.internal.Converter.wcsToMbcs (null, string, true);
byteCount= utf8.length;
pValue = OS.g_malloc(byteCount);
if (pValue == 0) return;
OS.memmove(pValue, utf8, byteCount);
return false;
