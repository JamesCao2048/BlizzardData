All platforms should clear mouse capture when modal dialog is opened
On Windows, when you open a modal dialog, SWT has code that goes around and
clears mouse capture.
This functionality apparently isn't present on
Linux/Motif.
All platforms should be made the same as Windows.
We had a case where a DragTracker called setCapture(true) then we created a
modal dialog box before the setCapture(false) was called.
SWT overlooked our
bogosity on Windows, but on Linux/Motif the UI stopped responding to mouse
events...
SN knows about this problem.
