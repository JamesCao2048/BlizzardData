Right-clicking on coolbar grabber causes strange behavior
Build F3 (20020612)
Redhat 7.2, KDE 2.2-10
(Both Motif and GTK2)
If you right click and release on a coolbar grabber (like a regular mouse
click), then the 4-way arrow cursor appears (as if to say, you may now move the
coolbar).
The coolbar will follow the mouse from now on, but only if you go
really slow, if you slide too fast then the coolbar stops following (but the 4-
way arrow is still there).
If you move on the grabber again then it starts
following the mouse again.
Also, after right clicking on a grabber, if you move your mouse under the
coolbar and then back up on a different grabber, then the coolbar jumps.
You
can even lock the coolbars and the 4-way arrow is still present.
The only way
to get out of the 4-way arrow cursor mode is to left click on the original
grabber.
