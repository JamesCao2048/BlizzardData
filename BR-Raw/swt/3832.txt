Project rebuild cannot write over .class files
I have a classes directory full of files that come pre-shipped to me.  My own
class files live in the same tree as additional files.  To make this work, I
have to deselect the Project's "Allow to clean output folders" setting.
However now the project does not clean output files, a rebuild cannot be
performed.
Steps to reproduce: - we'll basically create a new project with one class.
1) Make a "test" directory, with subdir "classes/otherpackage".  Put a
dummy "fred.class" file in the otherpackage directory (it can just be a text
file in reality, doesn't matter)
2) In Eclipse, create a new project with project contents being the "test"
directory from step 1.  Browse to the "classes" directory as the default output
dir.
You immediately get an error on the project about "Problems encountered while
deleting resources".  Seems bogus to me (is this a bug in itself?), but there
is a workaround.
3) Go to project properties->Java Compiler.  Click Use Project Settings, go to
the Other tab, and deselect "Allow to clean output folders..." (which isn't
very good English!  "Allow cleaning output folders" perhaps?  )  Anyway...
Click Apply, and Yes to rebuild, then OK from the project properties.  All is
well!!
4) Create a new class, Main.java, give it a main method.  Builds great!
5) From the menu bar, click Project->Rebuild.
You get an error "Class file not written".
In order to workaround this, one must manually delete the .class file, Refresh
the project, then rebuild.  But that's a lot of trouble to go to.
Be great if it would clean only the .class files relevant to the project's
source but leave the rest of the classes directory alone.  Or, at least compile
if the class file already exists - basically fixing the "Allow to clean output
folders..." checkbox is broken.
Thanks!
