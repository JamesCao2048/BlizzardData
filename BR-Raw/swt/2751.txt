JavaDoc for Composite.getChildren() is wrong
The JavaDoc says that it returns the children in the order they are drawn, when
the reverse is true.
getChildren() actually seems to return the children in the
opposite of the order they are drawn.
(Calling Control.moveAbove(null) moves a
control to the beginning of the list and makes it the topmost control)
The JavaDoc would also be more clear if it had an example: "For example, the
topmost control appears at the beginning of the array".
