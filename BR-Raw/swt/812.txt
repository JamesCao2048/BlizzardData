[Widgets] Focus lost after F3
I20091006-0800, Cocoa, Mac OS X 10.6.1
- Have a simple class like this:
package p;
public class C {
static int fField;
public static void main(String[] args) {
fField= 1;
}
}
- Set caret into reference to fField
- Press F3
=> Focus is lost.
Caret does not blink any more.
Pressing the Tab key about 11 times puts the focus back into the editor area.
Same problem occurs after refactorings (e.g.
extract local variable).
Tried in I20090923-1538, and there it's working fine.
