Help menu is broken
I20100805-1700
On my mac cocoa the help menu is broken.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Extract the I20100805-1700 Mac Cocoa build 32-bit
2) Start a fresh workspace.
3) Try to click on the help menu.
You will notice nothing happens and the rest of the menu items disappear.
(File, Edit, Source etc.).
Nothing in the log to indicate an error.
