Custom BusyIndicator - no hourglass cursor
The test case is in com.ibm.swt.boris.example.custom.BusyIndicatorTest in
Playground_Boris in swtwork.
We just run a sleep() inside a busy indicator.

This works on Windows but not GTK.
The reason for this, is closely related to  bug 34979 .
The whole showWhile()
runs in the UI thread, but gdk_window_set_cursor() is asynchronous.
If the
runnable does not have its own event loop, setting the cursor will have no
effect.
