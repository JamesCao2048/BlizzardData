ImageAnalyzer example - bug in the set background
build 20020617
1
- Run the ImageAnalyzer found on org.eclipse.swt.examples.
2
- In the Background Combo choice a different Color
3
- the canvas on center will not changed its background color, only the
scrollbar will.
The bug is on examples, though this is working properly on Windows.
A possible fix is remove imageCanvas.fillRectangle(...) call from the
changeBackground() method.
Maybe we should fix this to F4..
