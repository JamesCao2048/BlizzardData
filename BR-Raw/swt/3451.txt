[64] Crash in g_signal_lookup
From Juergen Kreileder :
I've tried a few simple tests with N20040228 and our current J2SE 1.4.2&1.5.0
builds for AMD64: The tests crashed right at startup in about 50% of all tries.
Ie.
it looks like there are still some pointers stored in (or truncated to)
32-bit ints and SWT only works if the real pointer happens to point into the
first 2G of mem.
All crashes seem to happen in OS.g_signal_lookup() with broken pointers like
0xffffffffe28b9c70 (which should have been 0x2ae28b9c70), I'll take a closer
look at it if I find some time.
