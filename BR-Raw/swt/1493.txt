Cannot dismiss attribute type combo
Open the schema editor on UI schema ...
org.eclipse.ui/schema/menus.exsd
Select an attribute and try and change the type.
The type changes (and the section fields get updated) but the combo box won't go away, and continues to push changes to the attribute section.
I tried the combos in the PDE editor and they did not exhibit the same problem.
