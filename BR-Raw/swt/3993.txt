Accents and 帽 don't work in editor using gtk
When I type 帽 (e帽e) or vocals with accents (like 谩, 茅, 铆, 贸, 煤)
don't work. This in java editor or text editor
I use Eclipse 2 final release, on SuSe linux 7.3 and gnome 1.4.
The value LANG variable is es_ES.
When I run gtk-demo I can use accent and 帽,
and when I use a eclipse wizard (like dialog for entry new task)
I can use 帽 and accents too.
