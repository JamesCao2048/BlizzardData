No default contextual menu item on Mac
Mac OS X 10.3.7
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=580505&aid=1162172&group_id=86683
When control-clicking, a contextual menu appears.
The first menu item is selected.
If I release the
mouse button without moving the mouse, the first item of the contextual menu is chosen.
No item of the contextual menu should be selected.
No item should be chosen.
According to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines,
"Don鈥檛 set a default item.
If the user opens the menu and closes it without selecting anything, no action
should occur."
