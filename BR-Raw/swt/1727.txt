[Browser] Support click-through for Browser and toolbar buttons
I20080129-1400
On Windows and GTK, widgets always react on mouse clicks, even if the containing shell did not have focus before.
On the Mac, Apple's UI Guidelines leave it up to the application designer to decide whether widget instances should be click-through or not.
Note that some SWT widgets already support click-through, e.g Link, Tree, Table, Label, Canvas, drop-down menu in ToolBar buttons (but not for normal toolbar buttons or other buttons).
I need a way to activate click-through behavior for the Browser and for ToolItems  in rich hovers (TOOL|ON_TOP Shells that don't take focus when made visible).
