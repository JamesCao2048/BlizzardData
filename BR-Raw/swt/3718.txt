gtk_progress_bar_set_fraction - crash when creating a class under latest Debian GTK 2.2 / Crux Theme
When I try to create a class in a new, empty project,
Eclipse M5 under Linux/GTK crashes.
I get the following
assertion violation message from the theme engine I'm using
(crux, Debian unstable, gtk2-engines-crux 2.2-3):
** (<unknown>:8306): CRITICAL **: file crux-draw.c: line 1017 (draw_box):
assertion `width
< 32768' failed

** (<unknown>:8306): CRITICAL **: file crux-pixmaps.c: line 419
(eazel_engine_image_render): assertion `width > 0' failed
The Eclipse crash log, which appears after this message, is attached
to this report.
Thanks for looking into this, and thanks for an awesome product!
