Drawing round rectangles, DND and antialias vows
I have a funny combination that causes problems in forms. It requires the following:
1) Drag & Drop and the new drag effect support
2) Dragging of a composite that has children and that paints on its background
3) Usage of 'GC.fillRoundRectangle()'
4) Usage of antialiasing
When all these are combined, the image created as a snapshot for drag effect does not paint children. Snippet to follow.
