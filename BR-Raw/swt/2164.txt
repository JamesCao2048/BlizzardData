[Program] Notes bookmark URL cannot be launched by swt for Linux-GTK
On Linux, swt for gtk assumes all the file names and urls contain a '.'.
So org.eclipse.swt.program.Program.launch will check if fileName contains '.' first.
For the filenames with '.', swt will call gnome's native function to launch this file.
Or else, this fileName is considered as a program and executed by Compatibility.exec.
But for Notes, its bookmark URL is like "notes:///ClientBookmark?OpenWorkspace" without a '.'.
So even Notes URL protocol is registered by gconf on Linux, Notes cannot be launched using Program.launch.
But it can be launched by firefox.
This problem blocks the program I'm working on so much.
So is there any way to solve it?
Thanks.
