[Leopard] errors logged to console by CGPathGetCurrentPoint
Leopard is logging an error to the console when CGPathGetCurrentPoint is called on an empty path. This does not happen on Tiger.
Error logged: <Error>: CGPathGetCurrentPoint: path 0x866600: no current point.
Test Case:
shell.addListener(SWT.Paint, new Listener() {
public void handleEvent(Event event) {
Path path = new Path(display);
path.getCurrentPoint(new float[2]);
path.dispose();
}
});
