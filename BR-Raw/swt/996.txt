[OLE] [EditorMgmt] Strange behavior while opening default gif editor
Build ID: Eclipse3.3M6
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Double click to any gif file, say abc.gif. I expect that default editor comes up.
2.Indeed, IE7 starts. Close it. You see that text editor for abc.gif is opened. It has just on line: "abc.gif"
3. Close this editor. Immediately new instance of IE7 comes up.
4. Close it and you see a message: "abc.gif has been modified. Save changes?".
Why user have to see and manipulate with this text editor? Why IE7 was launched twice?
