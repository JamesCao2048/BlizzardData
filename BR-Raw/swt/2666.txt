StyledText is still misbehaving
As followup to the breakage in yesterdays I-build, StyledText is still doing the jitterbug but it's no longer
resulting in crashes.  The cursor will occasionally dance around, particularly when backspacing.  Despite
being visibly placed in one spot, the deletion occurs at what I expect to be the correct position.  Hitting
enter seems to reset the cursor to the correct position.
