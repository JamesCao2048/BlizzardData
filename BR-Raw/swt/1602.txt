Created  attachment 90915   [details]
Open Type dialog
1) go to Control Panel-Accessibilty->Display and enable high contrast mode
2) open eclipse
3) ctrl-shift-t to open the open type dialog
expected result: I can read the contents of the list
result: the list renders with black text on a black background.
I can only read the text when I select an item.
