This is a problem with "right to left" running on linux.
running "eclipse
-dir rtl" in english on windows works properly
running "eclipse
-dir rtl" in english on linux does not create clickable links
on linux, when clicking the ANY links, they are brought into focus, but they do not go to the destination page.
but, if you press the space bar the proper page will be opened.
to easily see this problem go to:
window
-> preferences
-> general
-> editors
