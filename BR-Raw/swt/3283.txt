SWT exception docking a detached view
3.0 RC3
I was running a simple workbench and detaching/docking (I was taking screen
shots of the navigator for some documentation) the navigator view. I think this
was repeated 20 or so times.
Then, while docked I tried to open the context menu, and the following exceptino
occured. I was asked to quit the workbench because of the SWT exception. Not the
funny context menu that appears, no separators.
