[Contributions] Disabled menu items have enabled images when armed
When hovering over a disabled action (such as copy or cut when nothing is
selected) the image is displayed in full colour rather than in gray colour
expected.
I'm not sure if this is expected behaviour but it can be confusing as
I would think that having the image enabled implies that the action is also
enabled (and vice-versa).
I did a quick search for this and I found an old bug
-  bug 2764
- which looks
like a similar problem but it was reported as working in v2.0. I checked in
v2.1.3 and v3.0.1 but I still have enabled images on a disabled action.
