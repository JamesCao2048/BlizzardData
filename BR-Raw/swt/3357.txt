junit tests need to use the eclipse launcher
The eclipse junit tests currently start eclipse from the java executable
directly.
They should be started through the eclipse launcher directly.
Note that the Eclipse launcher does a few extra things like:
- set up the LD_LIBRARY_PATH/MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME variables for the SWT Browser
widget as documented in SWT FAQ.
Junit tests for SWT fail as a result on Linux
GTK.
SWT junit tests for GTK now disabled until PR closed.
