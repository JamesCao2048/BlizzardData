A snippet that shows the issue with boolean arrays
It looks like there is an issue with converting boolean array parameters that are passed to BrowserFunction.
I attached a snippet that shows the issue.
When passing an array like [false, false, false, false, false], instead of an array with false values the function receives an array with random boolean values.
I'm doing my tests with XULRunner 10 but I believe that the bug can be reproduced with previous versions too.
