[consistency] pressing Enter on Button fires MouseUp on win32 only
- run the ControlExample, stay on the default Button tab
- listen for MouseUp and Selection
- give focus to one of the example Buttons and press Enter

-> on win32 you'll get MouseUp, Selection

-> everywhere else you'll only get Selection
