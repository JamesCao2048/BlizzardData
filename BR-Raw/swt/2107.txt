Tree with style SWT.VIRTUAL | SWT.CHECK doesn't correctly check nodes without children
Build ID: M20070212-1330
Steps To Reproduce:
1. see attached code sample
2. run code sample
3. you should see a tree where every node which ends with "2" has no children.
4. the nodes without children have no checkmark, even though the code explicitely does item.setChecked(true) for every node
5. minimize/maximize the window, and suddenly the checkmarks appear
More information:
I'm using a tree like this: new Tree(shell, SWT.VIRTUAL | SWT.BORDER | SWT.CHECK).  I noticed during development a problem where sometimes the Checkmark infront of the nodes is not correctly refreshed, while for example the node Label refreshes correctly.
This problem can occur not only when the node is a leaf node, but I found the bug to be very easy reproduce for nodes without children (see the attached code).
It obviously is somekind of refresh problem, but I could not find a way to properly refresh a node.  Then I noticed that when I simply forced every node to always be checked that only nodes without children didn't refresh properly.  The work-around I use therefore simply sets the TreeItem to have 10 children, and in the next line it sets it to the real amount of children.
