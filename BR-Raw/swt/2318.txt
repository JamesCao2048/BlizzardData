Previous Word commands are too 'greedy'
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of  Bug #103254  +++
Description:
Previous word navigation & deletion commands do not include punctuation when
moving/deleting. It appears that only spaces & line breaks are considered. This
differs from the Next Word moving/deleting commands, which include punctuation.
To Reproduce:
1. Open a new Untitled Text File and enter the text 'This is some text,foo bar baz'.
2. Place the cursor at the beginning of the word 'bar', and use the Previous
Word (meta-b in emacs mode) command to navigate to the beginning of the word 'text'.
3. Note that it only takes one Previous Word command to do so; the comma is not
included in the word movement calculation.
4. Use the Next Word (meta-f in emacs mode) command to navigate to the beginning
of the word 'bar'. Note that it requires three Next Word commands to do so; the
comma is included in the word movement calculation.
The Next Word command behaves correctly; the Previous Word does not.
Note that the Delete Previous Word command exhibits similar word calculation errors.
