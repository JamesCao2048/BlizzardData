CR Key down arrives twice
I200410190941, GTK+ 2.4.9, KDE 3.3.0, Linux 2.6.8.1

On KDE, go into the package explorer and select an HTML file.
Then press
enter.
The HTML file should open in an external browser.
However, it either
opens two browsers or two tabs in a single browser.
This appears to happen
because the CR key down event is arriving twice.

Below is some debugging output.
It shows the CR traversal event arriving at
the key binding architecture, but nothing happening.
Then the CR key down
arrives at the key binding architecture
-- again nothing happens.
Then two CR
key down events arrive at OpenStrategy$1. This causes two editor open events
to happen.
This is not a (big) problem for Java editors, because a second open
event is effectively ignored.
