IE browser zone elevation blocks standard browser UI
When we use Helios M6 in our office, we see security warnings for every initial use of a browser widget, every time Eclipse is run.  Maybe our company has somewhat restrictive IE security settings for our intranet?
All of these standard features bring up an IE security warning and completely block the UI:
-- Help > Welcome (!)
-- JDT/CDT Hover help
-- Opening an *.htm file in an editor
The alert is:  "Security warning:  The current Web page is trying to open a site in your Intranet [[or Trusted sites list]].  Do you want to allow this?  // Current site: about:blank  Trusted site:  about:blank"
I've looked for other bugs mentioning this, but it seems only we are victims to it.  Everyone in our office sees this.  It seems perhaps related to < https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=278299 >, which is why I filed it here.
This never happened in Eclipses 3.1 through 3.5, and still doesn't.
I'm calling this "major" because it blocks the welcome page for new users.  In a clean workspace, this dialog comes up *behind* the Welcome page, and is invisible for whatever Z-ordering reasons; thus a new user will not be able to click anything on that page at all.  He can only close the view and *then* he'll see the dialog.
Further, all the confirmations for these dialogs are zapped on a new launch of Eclipse... sigh.
I tried following the guidelines here:  < http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565663%28VS.85%29.aspx > to disable the "zone elevation" warnings for local or intranet sites, and also disabling the network protection in Symantec Endpoint Protection, but it has no effect.
