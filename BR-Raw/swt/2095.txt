Form's BusyIndicator hangs workbench on GTK

Using the form editor's BusyIndicator hangs the workbench on GTK. Not using busy indication made the problem go away, the following was in the log:

The program 'Eclipse' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
(Details: serial 39186 error_code 3 request_code 38 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
