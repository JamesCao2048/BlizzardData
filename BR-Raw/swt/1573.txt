[Accessibility] Controls that implement kEventAccessibleGetNamedAttribute need to call swt accessible API
20080513
Many of the Carbon controls had to override kEventAccessibleGetNamedAttribute in order to provide basic accessibility for the control. If an application hooked an AccessibleListener to any of these controls, then the application's AccessibleListener code was not being called.
The fix involved coming up with a mechanism to let the Accessible class know that theEvent may already contain valid data. Also, care needed to be taken to make sure that CallNextEventHandler was not called twice for the same event.
