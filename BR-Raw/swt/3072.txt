Check button size does not change when right aligned
Run the control example.
- Button tab
- SWT.CHECK
- Alignment: Right
- Horizontal Fill
- Preferred
Button does not return to its preferred size.  The problem is that we have set
the usize on the child, but not reset it when we ask for its preferred size.
