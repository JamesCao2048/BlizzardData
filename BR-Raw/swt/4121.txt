Editor with focus, tab text disappears sometimes
WinMe, large fonts setting, 1280x1024, True color (32 bit)
Strangely, editor tabs with focus for files which start with the letter "W"
disappear when there are many editors.]
Selecting another tab makes the text visible.  This is only true for a few
files - this isn't a textcolor = backgroundcolor problem.
