GTK- contents of check and radio buttons can't be aligned to center and to the trailing edge of widget.
GTK container, which contains label of check and radio button, always remains
with it's default width. Therefore text of label visually is always aligned to
leading edge of corresponding SWT Button. We propose to resize this
container "manually".
