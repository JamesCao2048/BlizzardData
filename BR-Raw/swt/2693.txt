[browser] crash whenever a Browser is disposed
3.2M2 test build (does not happen on linux-gtk)
- run eclipse
- open the javadoc view
- close it by pressing the 'X' on its tab, and eclipse will shut down with the
error message below
- this problem has appeared as a side effect of M2 work that changed the order
of things that are done at dispose time (in an effort to keep widgets 'valid'
during dispose callbacks)
sh-3.00$ The program '<unknown>' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
(Details: serial 19210 error_code 3 request_code 10 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the
--sync command line
option to change this behavior.
You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
