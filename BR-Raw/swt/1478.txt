Mouse cursor disappears in editor and gets progressively slower coming back
Build ID: 3.4.0 (I20080617-2000)
Steps To Reproduce:
It is standard behavior on OS X that the mouse cursor disappears while typing.
However, after using Eclipse for a little while (in this case it was an hour that I started noticing it), the mouse cursor does not immediately reappear on mouse move, but takes about a second or so to come back.
This can be really disconcerting.
I have verification of this behavior from two other people, as well.
More information:
Incidentally, I was afraid this might be related to my Mac refresh provider causing slowdowns in the kernel, so I pulled it out just in case, and I get the same behavior.
