non composable key combinations erases first char in text editors
On a mac entering characters via composition (i.e.
a character like combination of ~ and n, to produce å¸½) works fine for combinations that produce a combined char, but for non existing combinations, the first entered character is instead erased.
This happens in editors, but not in fields in dialogs.
Reproducible: Always.
Reproduce by:
- Open a text editor (I tested in Java, as well as in Xtext generated editors):
- Type ~
- Type =
Result, the ~ is deleted.
Expected result: "~="
Work around: Type '~' then
<space> or
<esc> to exit compose mode, then type '='.
The issue is quite irritating as eclipse editors work differently than the standard on the mac.
