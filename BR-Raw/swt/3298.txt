[browser] F5 blanks out the Browser widget when setText used
Press F5 inside the Intro page in Eclipse .
IE refreshes the URL (about:blank)
- causing a blank page to be displayed.
setText is used to render html in memory.
We should probably block default IE accelerators when URL is about:blank so
that the content of setText is not cleared when the user presses F5.
