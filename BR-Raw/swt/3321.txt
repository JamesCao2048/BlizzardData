Shell location is not properly used
I'm using SWT 3.0RC1 to try and make a Shell inside my default outer Shell.
If I
set a location for the internal Shell before it is opened, the internal Shell is
centered inside the outer Shell.
I can position the internal Shell once it has
been opened, but this creates a flashing effect.
I'll attach an example snippet that demonstrates the effect.
The snippet tries
to position an internal Shell at 50,50 but it doesn't work (at least not under
GTK for me).
