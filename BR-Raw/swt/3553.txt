BIDI: Mirrored text appears on every editor
With the driver eclipse-SDK-2.1.2RC1-win32, every text (even in English)
is mirrored. For instance, the text "Installed features" appears as
"serutaef dellatsnI"
I made the test on a Windows NT Hebrew enabled platform
This problem does not occur on a Windows 2000 platform.
