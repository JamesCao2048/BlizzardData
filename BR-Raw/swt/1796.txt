up/down arrows don't work in a combobox on Linux
Eclipse 3.3 M5eh (I20070222-0951)
Up and down keyboard keys don't work in a combobox. To reproduce:
1. Open Find dialog in text editor. Search for something. Close the dialog.
2. Open Find dialog again. Type something else in Find combobox. Press down arrow key.
Noting happens. Expected behavior is scrolling to the previous search string.
