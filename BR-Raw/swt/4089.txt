ControlExample->Text beeps when I choose SWT.MULTI
Build F1 (20020521)
Win2K
(I'm not sure if this is SWT or just the SWT Example)
In the SWT example ControlExample, under the Text tab, click on Styles-
>SWT.SINGLE and then back on Styles->SWT.MULTI.
I hear a windows 'ding' when I
do this (the bell sound that means you did something wrong).
Then clicking on
other buttons also makes the bell sound.
Somehow I don't think it's supposed to
do that.
