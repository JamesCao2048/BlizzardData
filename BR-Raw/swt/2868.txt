Crash closing dialog when IM is open (IIIM)
build I20050330-0500 (3.1 M6 canditate)
New version of RedHat Linux (Fedora Core 3 and Enterprise Linux WS release 4)
are using a new technology called IIIM (Intranet/Internet Input Method
Framework) to replace the old XIM (X input method). See:
http://fedora.redhat.com/projects/i18n/
When running on these new systems eclipse will crash if a dialog is closed by
pressing the Esc key and an internal widget of this dialog has the IM open when
the Esc key is pressed. Tested on FC3 and EL-WS 4. Tested using Japanese IM and
Arabic IM.
