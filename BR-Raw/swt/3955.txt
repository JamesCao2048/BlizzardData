DCR: Table.setSelection(int, int) -- order matters
Build 20020226
In a call to Table.setSelection(int start, int end), it matters in which order
the arguments are given.
It assumes start
<= end.
It would be more resilient if it also allowed start >= end.
If it doesn't allow this, the spec should indicate the ordering requirement.
