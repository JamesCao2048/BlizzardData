SWT Snippet 77 For Table Col resize has an error in it (fix included beklow)
In the environment above SWT Snippet 77 which is supposed to perfectly
fill a table with columns does not work if the vertical size is just slightly
larger than that needed to cover the display of rows preferred.
In this case the code reckons the availiable horizontal area is smaller than
it really is and only alots "most" of the space leaving a small anonymous
phantom column on the right hand side.
I noticed that this remainder column
is about the size of a vertical scrollbar.
On debugging it indeed appears when
the snippet code calculates there will be a vertical scrollbar but the
SWT system decides none is required.
The reason the snippet code gets is wrong is this "if" condition, it tests:
Rectangle area = comp.getClientArea();
Point preferredSize = table.computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT,SWT.DEFAULT);
...
if (preferredSize.y > area.height) {
// Subtract the scrollbar width from the total column width
// if a vertical scrollbar will be required
Point vBarSize = table.getVerticalBar().getSize();
width
-= vBarSize.x;
}
However it appears that
table.computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT,SWT.DEFAULT); //DOES INCLUDE HEADER VERTICAL SPACE
comp.getClientArea()                        //DOES NOT
I have verified this in my environment by tracing the numbers while
resizing.
If one modifies the snippet test to be:
if (preferredSize.y > area.height + table.getHeaderHeight()) {
// (area.hieght comes from getClientArea
//  preferredSize from computeSize )
// Subtract the scrollbar width from the total column width
...
One gets a very pleasing result that always fills the table with the
columns perfectly even if there is, is not, or is almost need for a
vertical scrollbar.

Apologies if this is the wrong component I could not find a SWT related samples
