[Browser] XULRunner 10 does not eat some traversals by default
- works with older XULRunner versions
- create a Shell with a XULRunner 10 browser and a default button
- navigate the Browser to google
- type some chars in its search text and press Enter

-> this should initiate the search in google, but instead activates the default button
The root difference is that older XULRunner versions answered 4 (DLGC_WANTALLKEYS) for OS.SendMessage(hwnd, OS.WM_GETDLGCODE, 0, 0), but XULRunner 10 answers 0 for this, which affects Control.translateTraversal(MSG msg).
Some other traversals may be affected as well.
