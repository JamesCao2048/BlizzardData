Mac OS X accessibility does not have the standard relations
On Windows, there are several standard relations under MSAA, for example, a Label preceeding a Text will provide the accessible name for the Text.
On GTK, these relations were implemented for SWT using ATK relations.
(see Control.setRelations() and Label.addRelation() in the GTK code)
Need to implement these on Mac OS X.
