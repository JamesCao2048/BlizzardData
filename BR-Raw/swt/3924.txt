[Open Modes] Search results doesn't respond to double click
Build 20020521 (1pm)
This is with the workbench in "Single click, select on hover" mode.
1) Do a search for references that finds a match in a java file
2) Single click the result in the search view to open the java editor
3) Close the java editor that was opened in step 2).
4) Now double-click on the result in the search result view.
Nothing happens.  It seems to be non-responsive to double-clicks after the
result has been opened once before.  Another single click will open the result
again.
