Top item on popup is often invisible
0924 integration build
When popping up a context menu there's a ~ 75% chance that the top item will
not be visible.  Its slot in the menu is reserved, and it can be selected by
the user, but its label does not show.  Very often tracing over the item makes
its label appear.
I don't know of a specific test case that is always reproducable, but the
problem is very frequent.
