[DND] Mac Cocoa: Setting Control's cursor other than SWT.CURSOR_ARROW causes drag operation to show incorrect icon

The sample plug-in
Our RCP Application on Mac Cocoa platform showed a bug with DND.
We used a custom cursor and that seemed to be the key for seeing this bug on Mac Cocoa platform.
We didn't see this when our application was run on Mac Carbon.
To illustrate the issue, we have created a pure Eclipse sample application. Its details are given below.
We created a TableViewer and added DND Support. As long as we live with the default cursor i.e. SWT.CURSOR_ARROW, the icons shown for valid/invalid drop targets for DND operation works fine.
But once we add a custom cursor other than SWT.CURSOR_ARROW e.g. SWT.CURSOR_HAND to the table widget, the icon shown while DND operation is incorrect.
Now, even if it is a valid drop target, the icon shows "drop not allowed" Circle with a slash).
We did find some old bug reports in bugzilla (259003), but those were supposedly fixed in SWT 3.5M5. But we're using SWT 3.7.2v3740f and are still seeing it.
This is blocking important use case of DND in our application on Mac Cocoa.
