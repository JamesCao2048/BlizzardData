new GC(this) produces a GC that does nothing
Creating a graphic context by calling new GC(this) in a custom Composite widget
does not work on Mac OS: Drawing on the newly create GC shows no effect. (At
least drawing lines does not work, I have not tried much more).
My code works fine on Win32 and Linux. The bug appeared in 2.1 M4
