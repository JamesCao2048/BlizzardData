SWT_AWT.new_Shell() in GTK version blocks forever on RedHat 9
We are using SWT in our Application and also providing the facility to plugin
the application in various IDEs. I have been successfully embedding our UI in
NetBeans on Windows and Linux (with motif version of SWT). Embedding did not
work with other Swing IDEs (I have reported that problem previously).
Recently we switched from motif to GTK on Linux. After this our plugin has
stopped working in NetBeans.
To debug the problem I used a sample application (taken from one of the bug
reports) that embedds a SWT widget in JFrame. This application works fine on
Windows with JDK 1.4 & 1.5. On Linux it works fine with motif and JDK 1.5 (with
1.4 application crashes).
When I try the same application with GTK, the main UI (JFrame) comes up but SWT
widget is not displayed. On adding debug statements I found that the application
blocks on SWT_AWT.new_Shell() method call. It never returns and I have to kill
the process.
I am using SWT jars from the Eclipse 3.0.1.
I have tried changing the Theam from Bluecurve to Mist as suggested in one of
the bug report. But that also did not work.
