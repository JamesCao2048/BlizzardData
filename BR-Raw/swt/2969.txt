Pressing backspace in browser widget shows navigation cancelled page
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050222-0821
When you press backspace (or Alt+Left) in a browser that has had its contents
set using setText an action cancelled page is displayed.  I would have expected
nothing to happen since there was no previous URL.  Calling Browser.back() works
as expected.
public static void main(String[] args) {
Display d = Display.getDefault();
Shell s = new Shell(d, SWT.SHELL_TRIM);
s.setLayout(new FillLayout());
Browser b = new Browser(s, SWT.NONE);
b.setText("<html><body><p>Press backspace</p></body></html>");
s.open();
while (!s.isDisposed()) if (d.readAndDispatch()) d.sleep();
}
