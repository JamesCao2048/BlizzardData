Icon above cursor on drag and drop
build i0917-0010
In the Package Explorer when I select a file and start to drag it around, the icon for the file appears roughly one inch above the cursor itself.
Although the behaviour is not effected (ignore the icon and place the cursor at the destination), this is visually distracting.
