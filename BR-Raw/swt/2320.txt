Intermittent build failures -eclipse-master-${buildId}.zip doesn't exist
Warning: Could not find file/builds/N200607070010/src/N20060707-0010/eclipse-master-N20060707-0010.zip
There are intermittent failures on the build machine where the eclipse-master.zip doesn't exist.
I'll try passing more memory to the vm at this stage of the build.
It's a difficult problem to reproduce.
It only seems to happen every 10 builds or so.
