Tree Shift-Click not working when item collapse changes selection
Build 2.1-M2
I noticed in various occasions that shift-clicking would not work (would just
perform a selection of one item) mostly in the navigator/package view tree
views.
Redoing the selection is usually working fine, but it is painfull when this
behavior cannot be trusted.
