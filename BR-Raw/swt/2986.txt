Combo default size too small with certain fonts
I'm using some non-editable Combos with a list of pre-set strings to select
from, and I want it to stretch to accomodate the longest string inside the
list.
This works fine except when I switch to a certain font in Japanese
- MS
UI Gothic.
And it doesn't seem to be a Japanese thing, if I use another font,
it works.
It seems to be computing the size incorrectly.
I've noticed this in
our UI, and I can also find some instances in some preference pages where they
do the same thing.
See screenshots to follow.
