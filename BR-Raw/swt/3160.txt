Drop-down arrows (on tree) are not centered
The new SWT tree view on Mac OS X uses the drop-down arrows to drill down
into trees.
This is seen in (amongst other things) the project views and
also the preferences window.
The arrow icon though does not look centered with the text; in fact, it looks
as if it is positioned in the top of the line and the icon looks as if it
is taking a 32x32 pixel size when its only a 16x16 cursor.
Comparing Finder's tree-view of files and the Eclipse Preferences seems to
suggest that the tree icons aren't quite the same position as the Mac renders
them, or that the text line (and inter-line spaces) are too large.
