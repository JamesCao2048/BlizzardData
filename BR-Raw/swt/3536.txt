Key events don't send to code completion dialog
Build 20021002
Linux/GTK
The code completion system doesn't work quike well when it is activited on an
other frame that the main frame (dialog, preference page, ...).
Test case #1:
1. Open the Preferences page.
2. Select java templates (java -> templates).
3. Edit one template.
4. Put the cursor at the end of the template pattern and hit [CTRL]+[SPACE].
The code completion dialog is displayed.
5. Hit some keys, nothing happens.
6. Select a proposal with the mouse (single click).
7. Hit some keys, only the arrow up, arrow down and enter keys work.
Test case #2:
1. Create two compilation units called Test1 and Test2, without javadoc
associated to the classes.
2. Open the Preferences page
3. Select detail formatters (java -> debug -> detail formatters)
4. Create a new detail formatter, select Test1 as its type.
5. Type "Test" in the source viewer. Hit [CTRS]+[SPACE].
The code completion dialog is displayed.
The first proposals should be Test1, Test2
6. Hit some keys, nothing happens.
7. Select Test2 with the mouse (single click).
8. Hit some keys, only the arrow up, arrow down and enter keys work.
9. Select an other proposal, which has an associated additionnal info (class
javadoc). After the additionnal info is displayed, all keys can be used as expected.
It looks like a GTK problem, as the code completion works fine on others
platformes (Win32 and Linux/Motif).
