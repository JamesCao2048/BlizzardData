Problems disposing TrayItem
Hi,
I noticed problems disposing a TrayItem. In my application the user may chose
to have the trayicon, or not. This is set in preferences without restart, so
creation and disposal of TrayItems are handled during runtime.
When first calling TrayItem.dispose() and afterwards creating a new TrayItem,
the old one is still showing in the tray, but without an image or Menu set to
it.
If needed, I could write a sample snippet.
Regards,
Ben
