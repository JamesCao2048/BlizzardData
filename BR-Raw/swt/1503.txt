Rollover tooltips for owner-drawn trees should be hidden when the tree changes (e.g. when a parent item is collapsed and the mouse is no longer hovering over the original item, or when using the scroll wheel).
Steps:
- prepare an Outline for a Java editor like in the screenshot
- select and expand a parent item
- hover over a child that does not fit into the viewport
- a) press Arrow_Left or
b) scroll up and down using the mouse wheel
=> Rollover tooltip stays under the mouse cursor, although the item under the mouse has been replaced or has gone away.
