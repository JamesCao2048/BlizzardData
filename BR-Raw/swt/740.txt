TRAVERSAL-Events not delivered to InteractiveSplashHandler
i have extended the extensionpoint org.eclipse.ui.splashHandlers to provide a
custom splashscreen for my rcp application.
it works right now on mac os x,
but when i start it on a linux machine it seems that no one of the traversal-events,
e.g.
SWT.TRAVERSAL_TAB_NEXT and SWT.TRAVERSAL_TAB_PREVIOUS are delivered.
to reproduce you can simply try the 'simulated login session', the TAB-key is
not working to change the focus to the password-field.
i have tried to add an
TraverseListener and it was never triggered.
-Eclipse 3.3M7
-Linux Ubuntu Feisty Fawn (latest Release)
-Java 1.5 (Sun JDK)
this bug seems linux/gtk specific because it works without problems on mac os x
using eclipse 3.3M7 too.
