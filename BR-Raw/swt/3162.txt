Poor Canvas scrolling performance
Scrolling Canvas scrollbars redraw the whole client area, instead of drawing
just the part which has to be redrawn. This terribly slows down the performance
on Mac.
Is there a way to do the scrolling like on Windows, where the part of the
client area which stays visible is copied to a new location, and the part of
the canvas which was not visible is redrawn?
