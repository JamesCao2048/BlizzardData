Using PaintListener on Table destroys repainting (Button is the same case)
We are using PaintLister on Table to do custom drawing within some parts of
the table. (to workaround unrelated bug  Bug#90081 , Grid lines limitations etc.)
We discovered that when you move another app. window across the table, it
totaly destroys its content. (repaint broken). Please, see attached screenshot.
Trying to come up with simplest code, it happens as soon as the listener is
registered (and even when the paintControl method does nothing)!!! Please, see
the attached code.
Note that same problem happens with Button (and I would expect other native
widgets). On Button it is harder to reproduce (as the paint is quicker) but it
is there as well.
We are now (with our commercial RCP app.) in a quite difficult situation as we
either have to drop using PaintListener (and usability goes down
significantly) or keep it but then in the (perhaps not too frequent) case user
spots this problem, the perception of quality is destroyed. (note that if the
app. move is quick, we sometimes end up with table totally empty - filled by
backgound color).
