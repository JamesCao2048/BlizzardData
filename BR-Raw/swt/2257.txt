Combo displays selection range without focus
Editable Combos display their selection range even when they don't have focus.
Text does not do this.
Maybe this is just a bug in windows.
It is confusing
because it makes it hard to identify which control has keyboard focus.
public static void main(String[] args) {
Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
Combo combo = new Combo(shell, SWT.NONE);

combo.setItems(new String[] {"foo","bar"});
combo.setBounds(10, 10, 90, 30);

combo.setText("blah");
combo.setSelection(new Point(0, 3));

Tree tree = new Tree(shell, SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.SINGLE);
new TreeItem(tree, 0).setText("item1");
tree.setFocus();
tree.setBounds(5, 40, 100, 100);

shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch())
display.sleep();
}
}
