[Tree] Expanded state does not get set properly for an expanded/collapsed item in a tree
I have modified a simple SWT Tree code snippet
( http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt
-
home/dev.html#snippets) to listen to expanded/collapsed items in a tree.
On expanded/collapsed events, I print out the expanded state of the first item
in the tree.
I tested two scenarios:
1- If I expand/collapse the first item and print out its expanded state, it
does not get printed out properly.
It prints out "true" when I collapse that
particular node and "false" when I expand it.
Either the node's expansion
state is not being set properly, or my guess is that it's being set later in
the series of events.
In which case setting the enablement of the node in the
collapse/expand event methods has no effect.
2- If I expand/collapse any item but the first one, the expanded state of the
first item is printed out correctly.
I am attaching the sample Java application that illustrates this behavior.
I am using:
Eclipse Platform
Version: 3.0.0
