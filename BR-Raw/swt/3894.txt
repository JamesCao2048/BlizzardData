[StyledText] setTopPixel limits argument to logical line count
build 20021111
setTopPixel uses the logical line count to limit the maximum range of the
method argument.
When StyledText is used in word wrap mode and the number of visual lines is
greater than the number of logical lines (lines are wrapped) setTopPixel will
not allow scrolling to the last possible top line.
