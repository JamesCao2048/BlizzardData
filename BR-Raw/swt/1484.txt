[Browser] Eclipse causes JVM crash in libxul when editing Java
Created  attachment 104545   [details]
JVM crash log, hs_err_pid15103.log.
Build ID: M20080221-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Run Eclipse from terminal/command line
2.In the package explorer view, navigate to the source file I want to edit.
The project is a Java project and it is already open when Eclipse starts.
Double-click to open the Java file for editing.
3.Click on the name of the class (e.g.
to prepare to press F4 or use context menu).
At this point, Eclipse crashes predictably.
I was having some trouble with Eclipse/JVM crashing in libxul before, but it was not easily reproducible.
I made a new install today to see if that would sort things out, and now it is reproducible every time.
I will not change anything regarding Eclipse until people are satisfied there is enough information in this bug.
The JVM will crash at the same point each time, but the exit data as shown in the crash dialog is variable.
I don't know what this means.

I am also happy to provide any other information within my abilities, which is why I'm not going to touch anything regarding Eclipse until there is enough information recorded.
