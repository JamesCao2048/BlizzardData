Program.execute mangles URLs
3.0-gtk
On Gnome, Program.execute mangles the passed filename and tries to convert it
into an URL (it adds 'file://' in front of the name). This is only correct when
executing applications that expect a URL and when a real file is passed. When
executing the mozilla program, one may want to specify a URL instead of a file.
Actual: ' http://www.eclipse.org ' is converted to 'file:// http://www.eclipse.org '
Expected: URLs are left alone.
