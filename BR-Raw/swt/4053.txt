"Override methods" dialog too greedy with focus, also has no vertical scrollbar
In the linux gtk (2.0) port, the override methods dialog doesn't have a vertical
scrollbar, so I couldn't select a method that was below the first 15 or so
methods listed.
Even worse, it is overly greedy with its focus, so I couldn't even access my
window manager's features to resize the window (which was quite surprising).
This should be reproducable by creating a class that extends something with a
lot of methods, such as javax.swing.JTable and then selected Override methods
from the popup menu that appears when right-clicking on the source editor.
