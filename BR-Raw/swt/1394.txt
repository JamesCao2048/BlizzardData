change the keyboard block selection expansion increment to match average char width
Perhaps this is already fixed, just filing this for completeness.
Follow-up from splitting  bug 8521 :
From  bug 8521 comment 61 :
- when using the arrow keys to expand the selection over EOL, the spacing is
too big - it should use the average char width, which has the advantage to make
the probable use case - mono-spaced fonts - work nicely.
