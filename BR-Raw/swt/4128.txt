removeColumn are broken in Emulated Table
Knut,
I was playing with the your TableInteractiveTest this morning.
the tests removeColumn and removeLastColumn are complete broken, removing a
single column leads the table in a irreversible bad state (lost of cheeses).
The problem is the method removeColumnVisual in Table.
It's adding plus one for
the index of first column to be shift.
It's a bug because at this step the
column been removed was already remove from the vector.
So, changing the line:
moveColumns(column.getIndex() + 1, columnWidth *
-1);
by:
moveColumns(column.getIndex(),
-columnWidth);
is enough to fix this bug.
Here is the patch:
