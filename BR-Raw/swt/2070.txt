I20070410-1043
- new workspace
- set an empty file as user dictionary
- new project P
- open P/.project
- Select All
- hover over "ent" of the closing "</comment>" tag until tooltip appears
- move mouse to top
=> white area remains after "<projects>"
- with the same procedure, the tooltip for "<comment>" correctly restores the blue background under the tooltip
