alignment support for RowLayout and RowData
I have found that the RowLayout is pretty useful and has some unique functionality.
However, when I line up labels and combo boxes in a horizontal row, the vertical alignment is off.
I am being forced to use GridLayout in these cases to fix the alignment.
I think RowData should have an "alignment" field.
(possible values: SWT.BEGINNING, SWT.CENTER, SWT.END, SWT.FILL)  For horizontal rows, this field would specify the vertical alignment.
For vertical rows, this field would specify the horizontal alignment.
The semantics would be like the aligment fields in the GridData object.
If this seems reasonable but there isn't free time to do this, I may be able to write it myself and submit it.
So, please let me know if such a patch would be necessary and welcome.
