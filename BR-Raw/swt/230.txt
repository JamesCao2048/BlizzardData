CCombo dropdown list can go off the top screen bound
Build Identifier: Version: 3.7.2 Build id: M20120208-0800
If there are too many items in the dropdown list of CCombo (setVisibleItemCount = getItemCount > display.height / getItemHeight), dropdown goes off the top edge of the screen, making it impossible to select topmost items.
Once there was a  bug 37329  that mentioned all screen bounds for CCombo dropdown. It was closed as invalid (duplicate), however:
-  bug 135040  was fixed to prevent going off the right edge
-  bug 308083  proposes a fix to prevent going off the left edge
-  bug 7946  was fixed to prevent going off the bottom edge
And last ( bug 7946 ) fix produced this one, related to going off the top screen bound, that is especially noticeable since  bug 38368  (allowing to have a lot of items in a list) is fixed.
We can't use Combo on GTK because of  bug 160732  and  bug 245385 , so would like to switch to CCombo, but this bug prevents us from it.
A snippet and possible patch attached below.
Reproducible: Always
