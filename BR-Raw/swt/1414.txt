GC drawString garbled w/ GDI+ and raster font (was BidiLevel is improperly set to -1)
Hi,
I've been experiencing in my GMF diagram editor scrambling of the text labels.

The image above shows an example of this scrambling.
I've tried several different builds and get the same behaviour. The latest I used:
- eclipse-SDK-I20080918-0100-win32
- emf-sdo-xsd-SDK-I200809161800
- emf-transaction-SDK-I200809221455
- GEF-ALL-I200809091900
- gmf-sdk-2.1.2
I've regenerated the model code, and also the diagram code. Nothing worked. Has nothing to do with XML encoding. Even starting a new diagram, things are shown messed up.
The problem is located in org.eclipse.draw2d.text.TextFlow.paintText(Graphics g, String draw, int x, int y, int bidiLevel)
protected void paintText(Graphics g, String draw, int x, int y, int bidiLevel) {
if (bidiLevel == -1) {
g.drawString(draw, x, y);
} else {
TextLayout tl = FlowUtilities.getTextLayout();
if (isMirrored())
tl.setOrientation(SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT);
tl.setFont(g.getFont());
tl.setText(draw);
g.drawTextLayout(tl, x, y);
}
}
And the responsible is the "bidiLevel".
While debugging, I realized that the value of the text was never scrambled, but rather just drawn incorrectly. This argument was always set to "-1". I hacked it to be set always to something different to "-1", and it worked!
I suspected from it while trying different eclipse installations, GMF crashed with problems related with com.ibm.icu, where the "Bidi" concept is defined.
Do you have a clue why I'm receiving "-1" in the BidiLevel?
