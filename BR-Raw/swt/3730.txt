Setting the toolbar's background on RC2 doesn't work.
In the attached zip I've added a changed version of the PDE's "Plugin with a
view" project.
I've changed the ToolBarTest.views.SampleView.createPartControl
(Composite) method in order to "wrap" the table view in a ViewForm with a
toolbar.
I've also set the toolbar background to white (actually as you will
see I've set it to white twice).
If you run the plugin in RC2 the background color of the toolbar button is
gray.
Running it on 2.02 and 2.03 the background of the toolbar button is
white.
