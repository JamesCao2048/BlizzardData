turn off caret blink
There appears to be no way to turn off the caret blinking in eclipse.
It's
really annoying :-(
I use eclipse on linux.
My GTK+ and Gnome settings all have blinking turned off,
so it must be eclipse doing this.
Ideally, it should be a wider caret (i.e.
the width of a character), and the
color of it should be configurable.
