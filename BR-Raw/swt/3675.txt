Decorations.setImage() could do a better job with masked images
The current win32 code for setImage in the SWT.BITMAP case does a crude job of
synthesising an icon from the bitmap, when in many cases it could do much better
if it made use of the mask from the bitmap. The current code uses a blank mask,
genererated like:
int hMask = OS.CreateBitmap (bm.bmWidth, bm.bmHeight, 1, 1, lpvBits);
But a simple, higher level transformation can yield a nice icon from a .gif
(which I think is the most image common case), like this sample:
ImageData id = new ImageData("icons/lock-doc-16x16.gif");
shell.setImage(new Image(display, id, id.getTransparencyMask()));
I would suggest that Decorations.setImage() simply make use of the Image's
ability to generate an icon using its mask, when available.
