[SWT_AWT] Application freeze
Build Identifier: SWT I20101025-1800
I have an application relying on SWT_AWT, with a particular test case that freezes.
It is 100% reproducible.
This occurs with SWT I20101025-1800 and N20101021-2000, tested on 2 different Macs.
Using a Safari or XULRunner runtime and 32 bit or 64 bit lib does not make any difference.
This is a regression: SWT 3.7M1 does not have the issue.
Windows and Linux do not have the issue.
Let me know if I can be of any help.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
This time, I was not able to create a small test case narrowing down the issue (sorry), but it is relatively easy to set the environment up.
So:
1.Get the NativeSwing distribution from here:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/djproject/files/DJ%20Native%20Swing/0.9.9%20preview/
2.Add DJNativeSwing.jar, DJNativeSwing-SWT.jar, DJNativeSwing-SWTDemo.jar, lib/jna/jna.jar and lib/jna/jna_WindowUtils.jar to your classpath, as well as your SWT lib (sources of DJNativeSwing* are part of the distribution if needed).
Once it is set up:
1.Run "chrriis.dj.nativeswing.swtimpl.demo.DemoFrame" (you may need
-XstartOnFirstThread)
2.In the tree, click on "JWebBrowser > Simple Example".
3.In the tree, click on "Introduction > Codewise".
-> freeze, nothing responds after that.
