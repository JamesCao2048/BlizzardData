Command+click to deselect one of a multi-selection doesn't work
To reproduce:
# with the mouse select more than one project in the Package Explorer view
# Command-click one of the selected items to deselect it
# Observe that the previous selection is discarded, and the clicked item becomes selected (bug)
The expected behaviour is that Command-clicking one of a selection causes it to become deselected
