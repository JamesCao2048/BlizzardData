[portability] Drag Tool Turns Off on Linux
When you're dragging something and the mouse goes over an object, a tooltip, or
the edge, it cancel out of drag mode and goes back to a normal selection tool.
This only happens on Linux and has been a real source of annoyance for our
users.   Sure would love a fix.
