IE Browser widget should always encode LocationEvent#location, also for file:///
The IE Browser widget should always encode LocationEvent#location, also for "file:///" URLs.
Currently, the location is properly encoded for URLs with other protocols (e.g.
http:// or foo://), but the file:// protocol is handled specially, and even unusably in some situations.
Example:
<html><head><base href='file://C:/te%20mp/'></head><body><a href='fi%20le.html'>Link</a></body></html>
When you use setText in the ControlExample and then click the link, then the LocationListener events have location "file://C:/te%20mp/fi le.html".
Note how the first part of the URL is properly encoded, but the second part is not.
Without the
<base> element, the location is not encoded for file:// URLs with IE, e.g.:
- setUrl("file:///C:/t/sp%20ace/link.html") notifies location
"file:///C:/t/sp ace/link.html" (bad), but
- setUrl("foo:///C:/t/sp%20ace/link.html" notifies
"foo:///C:/t/sp%20ace/link.html" (good).

This should really be specified in the API.
