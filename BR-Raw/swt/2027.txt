No context menus in tables
I20070514-0010 (works in I20070511-0010
- got broken in I20070512-0010).
Context menus no longer appear in all views that show information in a table (e.g.
Search, Types view, lower pane of Type Hierarchy).
Works in trees.
Looks like an SWT bug since replacing SWT with the version from I20070511-0010 fixes the problem.
