Cannot open filenames with 8-bit characters
Currently, the FileDialog widget on GTK+ passes the resulting filename to
Converter.mbcsToWcs to convert it from UTF8 to UTF16.  However, filenames on
UNIX systems are not always encoded in UTF8.  The fix is to first use
g_filename_to_utf8 to convert the filename to UTF8, and then convert the
resulting string to UTF16.
For testing this problem, I used the second .tar.gz file posted to  bug 84578 .
This file uses the ISO-8859-1 encoding, and to get g_filename_to_utf8 to work,
you must first set the environment variable G_FILENAME_ENCODING to "ISO-8859-1".
