Summary: DBCS: Window resizing does not work properly
Steps to recreate problem:
1- select File->New->Project.., then create New Java Project.
2- add package and class to the project, then select Java Editor which shows
newly created class.
3- resizing eclipse window.

Eclipse fails to resize window.
When window is extended, blank area is
appeared.
When window is shrinked, some view is concealed.

caused by selecting Editors, such as Java Editor, Text Editor and so on.

when selecting specific pages, such as Welcome pages and plugin.xml pages,
window resizing works correctly.
