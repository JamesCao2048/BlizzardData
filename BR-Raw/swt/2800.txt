Slowdown between 3.1 RC1 and N20050602 due to change to ImageList
build N20050602
Several of the UI performance tests got slower between RC1 and N20050602, on
Windows.
I tried running one of them, the OpenCloseWindowTest on N20050602, and also with
N20050602+RC1's SWT.
Here are the numbers (on Win2K):
N20050602:
testOpenCloseWindows:org.eclipse.debug.ui.DebugPerspective
Elapsed Process: 844 ms
Elapsed Process: 828 ms
Elapsed Process: 854 ms
average: 842
N20050602 with SWT from RC1 (I20050527-1300):
testOpenCloseWindows:org.eclipse.debug.ui.DebugPerspective
Elapsed Process: 751 ms
Elapsed Process: 757 ms
Elapsed Process: 731 ms
average: 746ms
increase: 96 over 746 = 13% slower
I've only included the times for the debug perspective.
The other perspectives
showed less of a change, and seemed to correlate with the numer of icons (either
in the menus or toolbars or both).
The debug perspective has the most icons.
I'm suspicious of the ImageList change to always specify OS.ILC_MIRROR.
I'll see if unwinding that single change makes a difference.
