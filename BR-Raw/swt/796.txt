Internal browser cannot add exception for self-signed certificates in Linux
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: I20091020-0931
In Windows, the internal browser will give a yes or no prompt to let you accept the self-signed certificate, but in Linux, there is no such option and you are left with a blank page.
If you use the external Firefox browser, there is an option to add an exception for this certificate, but you cannot do this with the internal browser.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find a website that has a self-signed certificate
2.Open that website with the Eclipse internal browser
