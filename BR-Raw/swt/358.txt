Mnemonic on label field does not work
Created  attachment 199917   [details]
Test class to reproduce the described behavior.
Mnemonics on labels are implemented to set the focus to the next focus-able control.
This works fine if in the same composite is a focus-able control.
If not the mnemonic gets ignored.
Responsible for this bug is the 'Label.mnemonicHit' method which checks the index against this also in parent composites.
