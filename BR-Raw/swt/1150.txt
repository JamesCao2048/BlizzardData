Ctrl+Tab traversal broken with traverse listener
I20090224-0800
- Custom Control Example > Styled Text
- add listener for Traverse
- give focus to StyledText
=> Ctrl+Tab does not let focus out of the widget. I sometimes get out when I hold Ctrl and then wildly press and release the Shift and Tab keys.
Similar problems in the Workbench when I try to get out of a Java editor (or invoke content assist and then try to give focus to the popup by pressing Tab).
