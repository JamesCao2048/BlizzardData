Implement Printing on Cocoa
Created  attachment 116212   [details]
ControlExample.java sent to printer (pdf) from Cocoa Eclipse
Tried printing in the 20081026 Nightly build for Cocoa.
This feature has not been implemented yet, but it actually works... except that the output is upside-down.   :)
See attached printout of ControlExample.java.
