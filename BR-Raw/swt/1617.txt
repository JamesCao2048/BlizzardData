I checked the column creation code we use in these two tabs to see how they might be different.
The page (Available Software) where the problem is observed, we use a tree and create tree columns like this:
TreeColumn tc = new TreeColumn(tree, SWT.NONE, i);
tc.setResizable(true);
tc.setText(columnConfig[i].columnTitle);
tc.setWidth(convertHorizontalDLUsToPixels(columnConfig[i].defaultColumnWidth));
The page (Installed Software) where the problem is not observed, we use a table and create table columns like this:
TableColumn tc = new TableColumn(table, SWT.NONE, i);
tc.setResizable(true);
tc.setText(columns[i].columnTitle);
tc.setWidth(convertHorizontalDLUsToPixels(columns[i].defaultColumnWidth));
}
Both the tree and table are created with these style bits:
SWT.MULTI | SWT.FULL_SELECTION | SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.BORDER
For this reason, I believe the problem to be SWT's handling of the different columns on this platform?
I didn't create a snippet (sorry) but all you have to do is open the Help>Software Updates dialog and compare the columns in each tab in the dialog.
