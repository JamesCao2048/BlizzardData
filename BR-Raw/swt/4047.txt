[ExternalTools] F3 (and F2) crashes the JVM when trying to cancel an external tool on linux-gtk
When I create an external tool to run this shell script:
#!/bin/sh
sleep 1m
(I put that in my testcase project under the name test2.sh and pop to a shell to
make it chmod 755)
I create an external tool with the following properties:
Location: ${workspace_loc:/testcase/test2.sh}
Arguments:
Directory: ${workspace_loc:/testcase}
Then I run it. Of course it sleeps for 1m, so I press "cancel", which doesn't
kill the process, but rather attempts to wait for it to finish, I get bored of
waiting for that, and click the X in the top right, asking my window manager to
close the window. Eclipse promptly crashes, popping up the motif error dialog:
JVM terminated. Exit code=6
-cp /usr/local/lib/eclipse-F3/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
-os linux
-ws gtk
-arch x86
-showsplash /usr/local/lib/eclipse-F3/eclipse -showsplash 600
-data /home/burner/.eclipse
It also dumps a JVM crash page, so I'm attaching the hs_err_pid5155.log
I assume this is an SWT problem with GTK because is says an exception was raised
outside the VM...
