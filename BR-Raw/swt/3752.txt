Cannot get file extension from swt FileDialog
There's no way to get the file extension that the user selected from the
FileDialog.
It makes this dialog almost unusable since we can't determine the
correct file extension to append to the file name.
We need an api for the file
dialog to return the "Save as type" field that the user selected in the
FileDialog.
Athough we are using this dialog in our own product, this problem can be
illustrated when you export to a jar file.
Select *.zip in the "Save as type"
and enter a file name (eg.
test).
The export wizard should use the
file "test.zip" when this happens.
STEPS:
1) Select a java file
2) Select File->Export...
3) Select JAR file and press Next
4) Press Browse...
to select a Save As file dialog
5) Enter test for the file name
6) Select *.zip for the "Save as type" field
7) Press Save
Result:
The JAR export wizard uses "test" for the JAR file field.
Expected result:
The JAR export wizard should use the "test.zip" for the JAR file field.
