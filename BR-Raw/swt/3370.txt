CTabFolder: Selecting tabs should not affect whether chevron is shown (should use constant space)
build I20040310 + latest from HEAD
- in default layout of Java perspective, in default window size (Window > New
Window), the Package Explorer and Hierarchy view are in the same folder
- both tabs appear, but Package Explorer's name appears as Package Expl...
- if not, then shrink the folder until it does
- click on Hierarchy tab
- the Package Explorer tab disappears and you get the >>1 chevron
- you, are in a different mode now, and experiencing disorientation
- choose Package Explorer from the chevron menu
- boths tabs are visible now
Simply switching between tabs should not affect whether the chevron is shown.
The tabs should use constant space across selection, even if they trade off
space with each other.
