Creating of new Image is failed in some cases.
This is caused by little mistake in the copying of block of code in the new
method init():
.................
if (blackIndex ==
-1) {
/* There was no black in the palette, so just copy the data
over */
//!		System.arraycopy(source.data, 0, image.data, 0,       //!
System.arraycopy(source.data, 0, imageData.data, 0,
imageData.data.length);
.................
