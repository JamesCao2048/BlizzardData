License Agreement Does Not Display on HP-UX
Our license agreement does not display in the Feature License panel of the Install wizard on HP-UX.
The license is quite long, but does display properly on other platforms
-- including other UNIX platforms such as Solaris/Motif and AIX.
I don't know what the size limit is, but I tried a very small license and it did display properly.
But IBM legal has given me the license to be used and I can't edit it down.
