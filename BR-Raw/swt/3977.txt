accessibility - tab key in dialog boxes
Windows standard is that tab and shift+tab keys within a dialog box move the
focus to the next previous control even if the control is in the same group.
But in eclipse if there are several controls in the same tab group one is
forced to use arrows keys to switch focus among them;
Users of accessibility devices such as screen readers are not used to this
behaviour which, if not known, could make them to ignore the existence of
controls in a dialog box because they are completely skipped tabbing around.
So I propose that tab and shift+tab move focus even to controls belonging to
the same group.
