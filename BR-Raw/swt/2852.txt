TreeColumn causes vertical scroll to appear
Adding a TreeColumn to a Tree control causes the vertical scrollbar to appear
even when not needed.
The following code is an extract of a ViewPart extension:
public void createPartControl(Composite parent)
{
tree = new Tree(parent, SWT.SINGLE);
tree.setLinesVisible(false);
tree.setHeaderVisible(true);
// The following line causes the vertical scrollbar to appear
TreeColumn treeColumn = new TreeColumn(tree, SWT.LEFT);
}
