Double click on current stack element in stack trace does not focus editor
Version: 4.3.0
Build id: I20130605-2000
This is a regression from 3.x.
If you stop at a breakpoint, the editor corresponding to the breakpoint is correctly made active and the cursor positioned at the breaking line as expected.
However, if you then switch to another editor, and then double click on the stack trace line, it does nothing.
It should do the same actions as when it hit the breakpoint.
