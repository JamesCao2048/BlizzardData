toolbar looks very ugly with Win XP's lnf (using manifest file)
When using the manifest file of  bug 4789  i get a very ugly toolbar.
It is suddenly bigger,(smaller would be nice)
but with a not so nice white line around the normal size.
Strange thing is if i start eclipse with manifest and i open a perspective the
toolbar is big.
When i close eclipse then and i reopen it without manifest
file the toolbar is still big.
When i close all the perspectives and then
reopen eclipse the toolbar is small again.
