VoiceOver broken when an Accessible object is set
If you turn on VoiceOver in 10.6 and move the mouse over a widget with an Accessible object set for it, VoiceOver can't see the control and therefore can't read its contents.
To reproduce:
1. In Eclipse 3.6m6, run org.eclipse.swt.examples.accessibility.ControlsWithAccessibleNamesExample
2. Turn on VoiceOver (cmd-F5)
3. Move the mouse over the controls in the window.
---> Nothing happens. The VoiceOver focus is on the close button of the window.
