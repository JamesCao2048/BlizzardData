JavaScript error with generated content from GWT
1) Screen cap of the JS error popup (attached in zip)
2) The page source that reproduces the problem (attached)
- unzip com.ibm.threadanalyzer.zip onto any directory and open the tagui.html file
3)  Eclipse 3.0.2, we can not move off this version (its required by WED)
4) Using GWT toolkit (generated html & JS).  Issue only appears on SWT Browser Widget.  IE and Firefox run the generated GWT code w/o any issues or status icons of JS errors.
If you need anything else, just let me know.
thank you.
