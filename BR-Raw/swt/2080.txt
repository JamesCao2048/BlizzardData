KeyEvent.doit does not work for a CCombo
I want to perform an action for a specific key sequence (Ctrl+Space).
I do not want the space character to appear in the CCombo.

Using the following code in a KeyListener does not work:
public void keyPressed(KeyEvent event)
{
if (event.stateMask == SWT.CTRL && event.keyCode == ' ')
{
event.doit = false;
// rest of code...
}
}
It does however work as expected for Combo, Text and StyledText.
