cheese in java editor
Version: 3.3.0
Build id: I20070608-0010
The bug is in TextLayout, it doesn't draw the full selection background properly cause it has a test (for performance reason) where it doesn't draw a line when textual part of the line is outside of the clipping.
To reproduce this problem on eclipse just resize the editor, or move a window over the editor, or open the cotext menu over it.
Photon, has the same problem.
