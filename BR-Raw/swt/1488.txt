GC.setAlpha() / GC.getAlpha() does not work properly on Linux
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of  Bug #193067  +++
GC.setAlpha behaves differently to the other platforms (Windows and Mac). The following code snippet has a different behavior on Linux:
GC gc = ...;
gc.setAlpha(100);
gc.setAdvanced(false);
gc.getAlpha() will return the following values on the following platforms:
Windows 255
OS X    255
Linux   100 (WHOOPS!)
This is beacuse GC.setAdvanced(false) only ever resets the data.alpha value iff data.style & SWT.MIRRORED != 0.
The simplest solution is to add 'data.alpha = 0xff' to GC.setAdvanced:
public void setAdvanced(boolean advanced) {
if (handle) ...
if (data.style & SWT.MIRRORED !=0) ...
if advanced && data.cairo !0 =) return;
if (advanced) {
try {
initCairo();
} catch (SWTException e) {}
} else {
if (!data.disposeCairo) return;
int /*long*/ cairo = data.cairo;
if (cairo != 0) Cairo.cairo_destroy(cairo);
data.cairo = 0;
>>>     data.alpha = 0xff;   <<<
data.interpolation = SWT.DEFAULT;
data.backgroundPattern = data.foregroundPatter = null;
data.state = 0;
setClipping(0);
}
}
Note, this fix isn't tested yet, but if someone has can do this, they can use the testcase in  Bug 193067  ( https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=107410 ) to verify the fix; and as noted in the testcase, don't forget to set the conditional breakpoint.
