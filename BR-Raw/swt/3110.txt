TableEditors shifted to the right when table has image
I20041214-2000
TableEditors are shifted to the right when the table has an image. Happens when
editing cells in Tasks view, Refactor > PullUp dialog, Externalize Strings, etc.
Seems to be the same issue that has been fixed several times before (see e.g.
bug 42145 ,  bug 63105 ,  bug 62552 , and dups).
