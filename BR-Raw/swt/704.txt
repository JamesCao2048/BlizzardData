Eclipse on AIX 4.3.3 hangs
There is no repsonse to user events like clicks or closing the application.
I am running the 2.1 version of Eclipse on AIX 4.3.3 with APAR IY27694
applied.  I have X11.motif.lib at service level 4.3.3.80, so the release notes
says not to install IY41939.
The Eclipse application installed well.  The splash screen comes out funny --
the two lower GIFs are switched.  When the application finally displays
(seemingly correctly) then nothing happens if I click anywhere in the window.
I am also using this with ViewNow X -- a Windows X windows Server.  This works
well with other X11 and java applications on AIX, so I have no reason to
believe it would be the cause of the problems.
