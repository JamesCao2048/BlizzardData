GC.drawImage() inhibits further drawing (on Image for a Button)
After a call to GC.drawImage() the Image associated with this GC cannot be
modified any further, e.g.
GC.drawText() or GC.fillRectangle() will not
produce any visible result.
To create a Button with both an Image and text, I draw an Image at runtime wich
contains both of them.
Then I set the combined Image as the Image for the
Button.
This worked with SWT 3.1m4.
With SWT 3.1rc2, this no longer works
- the image displays nicely, but the text
is missing.
Two guesses as to what the source of the problem might be:
1.The Button looks beautiful with the new XP style, perhaps there
has been introduced a bug along with this new feature?
2.The image is a PNG with 32 bit alpha channel, perhaps the problem is
associated with the handling of this type of image?
Example (this code worked with 3.1m4):

// Paint the combined Image for the Button
final Image wholeImage = new Image(getDisplay(), width, height);
final GC wholeImageCanvas = new GC(wholeImage);
wholeImageCanvas.setFont(button.getFont());
wholeImageCanvas.setBackground(button.getBackground());
wholeImageCanvas.setForeground(button.getForeground());
wholeImageCanvas.drawImage(image, imageX, imageY);
wholeImageCanvas.drawText(button.getText(), textX, textY, SWT.DRAW_MNEMONIC |
SWT.DRAW_TRANSPARENT);
