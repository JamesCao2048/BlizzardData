This failure was exposed by DNFs in compare tests in few recent N-builds.
After some investigation I assume it's caused by recent changes in SWT.
I mean build I20090818-0800 work fine, the same build with compare from HEAD works fine too.
Adding SWT from HEAD to that configuration makes the problem appear.
I'll attach log entries shortly.
However they probably don't convey to much information.
