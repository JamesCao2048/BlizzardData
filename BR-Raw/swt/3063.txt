Clarify Javadoc of Display.postEvent
I20050202-0800
The return value of Display.postEvent's Javadoc says:
* @return true if the event was generated or false otherwise
It is not clear whether this means that it's not supported i.e.
will always
return false for that event (type) or whether it means it did not work this time
and I can try it again until I get true.
