calling CTabItem.setFont (and setImage) repeatedly with null causes repaints
I20040527
If you call setFont with some font Object, and later call it again no repainting
is undertaken because ther eis a check to ensure that the font objects are not
equal.
This doesn't work if you call setFont with null repeatedly, however.
Each call will result in a repaint.
A line such as:
if (font == null && this.font == null) return;
would prevent this.
This is having a noticable impact on the Console view, whos
events cause this operation to be undertaken often.
It is currently flickering
excessivly when output is written to it.
We could check ourselves using
getFont() but you're already doing half of this work in CTabItem already.
The same problem also applies to setImage.
