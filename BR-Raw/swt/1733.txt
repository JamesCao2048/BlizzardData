Combo#add(String,int) does update selection-index
Created  attachment 86364   [details]
Snippet to reproduce
When e.g.
the first item is selected and you call Combo#add("a1",0) the index is not shifted to 1 and the widget still displays the old-item.
CCombo behaves correctly.
This leads to undesired effects in JFace-ComboViewer.
