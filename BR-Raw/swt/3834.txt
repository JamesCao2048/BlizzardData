TVT2: truncated text in dropdown for Dependencies tab in manifest editor
Description:
Open a plugin.xml file in the editor, and click on the Dependencies tab.
The
string Loops in dependency graph appears by default in the Find field.
In
french, the first letter B (of Boucle) does not show.
I have to select another
option in the list and go back to the loop string to see it.
Steps to recreate problem:
1-In the Navigator view, expand a project, select plugin.xml and open it in the
editor.
2-Select the Dependencies tab
I will attach a screencap of this problem.
