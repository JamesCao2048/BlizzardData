SWT: Program.getImageData() returns null when icon name has quotes.
Build ID: R-3.3-200706251500
Steps To Reproduce:
My VLC application is registered for several extensions, but not all the ones it supports.
In the registry, there is:
VLC.aac, VLC.ac3, etc.
Now VLC.ac3 is registered for the ac3 extension, and the
getImageData() works.
But for VLC.aac, getImageData() returns null.
In the registry though, the two entries map to the same DefaultIcon.
I found that the icon contains double quotes in its path.
The entry is:
"C:Program FilesVideoLANVLCvlc.exe", 0
In the Program.getImageData(), in the code that executes when the extension is null, I modified the value (at runtime) of the filename (after the substring in that case) to remove the double quotes, and it does return a non null image data.
I guess the code should check if the name contains quotes and remove them before extracting the icon.
