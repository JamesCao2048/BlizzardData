CBanner at top does vertical sizing based on left components
If the text on the buttons on the right is larger than the height of the image
alone, then the buttons become cut off.  This can be easily seen by bumping up
the font size on the OS.  It happens by default on my machine.

This should be easy enough to fix, but has a fairly significant visual effect
for Linux users.
