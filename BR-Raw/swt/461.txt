swtlib-64 is created and left behind in tmp directory in world writable mode (chmod 777). This is a security issue.
Build Identifier: SWT 3.5.0.v3550b
Using Eclipse Memory Analyzer 1.0.1 I noticed that SWT is leaving behind temporary data in /tmp, namely the directory /tmp/swtlib-64 in our case.
This directory is world writable and reported as security issue by our systems.
The problematic code line is
Runtime.getRuntime ().exec (new String []{"chmod", "777", path}).waitFor(); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$
in
org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library
It is not trivial to resolve as the current approach assumes that the swtlib can be shared system wide (hence world writable flag is necessary).
However, this assumption is challenged on security sensitive systems with multiple users.
Code could be injected into the SWT libraries and would be executed with the rights of the user running any Eclipse product on the same system.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Check /tmp and remove potentially existing directory swtlib-64:
txruf@passent1:/tmp/ [] ls swtlib-64
/bin/ls: swtlib-64: No such file or directory
2.Run an Eclipse product
- e.g.
Eclipse Memory Analyzer.
3.Check /tmp, it will contain swtlib-64 with world writable flag set:
txruf@passent1:/tmp/ [] ll swtlib-64

4.Different user replaces original library with modified version:
