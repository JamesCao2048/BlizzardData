Combo eats text on Enter
I20110201-0800, same on WinXP and Win 7
- Control Example > Combo
- click the Combo's dropdown arrow
- type ABC
- press Enter key
=> the text I just entered is eaten (text field is cleared)
=> expected: text stays, but drop-down is closed
This only seems to happen if at the time the drop-down is opened, the text field contains an entry from the combo list.
Happened to me in the File Search dialog in the "File name patterns" field.
