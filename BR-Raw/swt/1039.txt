[carbon] Control#getBackground() and getForeground() returns new Color
Created  attachment 132821   [details]
Unit test for getBackground
On osx carbon (3.4.1->3.5M6), getBackground()/getForeground() returns a new Color object each time the method is called :
Color getBackgroundColor () {
return background != null ? Color.carbon_new (display, background) : defaultBackground ();
}
so Canvas.getBackground() != Canvas.getBackground()
This is not the case on cocoa (3.5M5-3.5M6), where the same object is returned and Canvas.getBackground() == Canvas.getBackground().
What is the correct behavior ?
The attached junit test fails on carbon but succeed in cocoa (see comment in java file)
