Lots of stuff leaked when closing and reopening views
M20120909-2000.
Lots of objects are leaked in a simple close/open part scenario.
Simple test case:
1.prepare a perspective with only the Navigator view open
2.reset the instance counter of your profiler
3.close the Navigator
4.reopen the Navigator
==> see many instance being leaked, e.g.
3 ToolItem(s) and 2 ToolBar(s)
