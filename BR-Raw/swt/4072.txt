Scale with preferred size is unusable (no range of motion)
Build F1 (20020521)
Redhat 7.2, GTK2, KDE 2.2-10
(GTK Only)
See the SWT example ControlExample, under the "Slider and Scale" tab.
You can't
use the scales on the right side (minimum, maximum, selection) because their
size is set to the size of the thumb, so there's no room to move left or right,
making this widget unusable.
This only happens to the scale on the left side (the one we're customizing) when
the Size->Preferred option is set.
If it's a fixed size or horizontal fill it
works fine.
