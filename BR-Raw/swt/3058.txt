Use GDK_HAND2 instead of GDK_HAND1 for SWT.CURSOR_HAND
A common use for the hand cursor is for use with links as in a web browser.
The
cursor used by default for links in Mozilla Firefox looks like GDK_HAND2, while
currently we use the right-pointing hand, GDK_HAND1. It would be nicer to
follow Mozilla on this one, as the hand cursor we currently use often looks out
of place.
