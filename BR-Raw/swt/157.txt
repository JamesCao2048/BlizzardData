Mac cocoa combo draw wrong and spews long error message when input multi-lines
Build Identifier: SWT 3.7.2
The Combo.computeSize() work well for single line input, but will return much higher height for multi-lines input.   This lead to wrong drawing for combo and/or its parent which depend on Combo.computeSize().
This is similar to previous  bug 251910  ( https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=251910 )
As the warning message spews by Apple in console, "Vertically resizable combo boxes are not
supported...".   This should be fixed by changing Combo.computeSize()  to always return the height for single line text.
Reproducible: Always
