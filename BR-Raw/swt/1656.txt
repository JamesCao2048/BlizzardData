Scrolled form does not resize child controls when the form is resized
Build ID: I20070625-1500
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Use MultiPageEditorPart
2. In a form page create a few controls on a composite that
is parented by the scrolled form.
3. Resize the editor.
The controls do not get resized , but rather the editor covers them up as you shrink it.
4. Would expect the controls to be resized to fit the new size of the scrolled composite.
More information:
It seems to be in the ScolledCompositeLayout and ScrolledComposite classes.
The minHeight gets calculated when the composite gets drawn and gets cached and never gets changed.
So once the minHeight of the editor becomes
< the min height composite , scroll bars appear on the editor.
The layout takes the Math#max() of the minHeight of sc or the actual height.
If the min height is  > , then the scroll bars appear.
I think that the composite should resize all of the children appropriately.
This produces a 508 accessibility problem.
For example , if you are using a table , and it is being partially covered up by the editor , and scroll down through it via keyboard.
The focus leaves the viewable area.
