Cannot select a patch file in WPF
Version: 3.3.0
Build id: I20070529-0010
When you select a patch file using thr browse button only the folder path is added to the dialog
- you need to type in the file name yourself.
This isn't happening on the other file selections (like the import archive dialog) and only on WPF
