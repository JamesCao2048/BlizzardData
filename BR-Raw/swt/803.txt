Trying to dispose a dragged composite in dragFinished() ends up in an "Invalid memory access" JVM crash. Happens with SWT versions 3.5 and M20090917-800 (both cocoa 64bit), using java 1.6 on OS X 10.5.8. Trying to dispose the parent of the dragged composite results in the same crash too. This doesn't happen on Linux (SWT 3.5 64bit, java 1.6, Ubuntu 9.04). I attached a test class and the crash dump.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag one composite onto the other
2.
3.
