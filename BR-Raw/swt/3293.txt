No chevron when not enough space to show all the tabs in CTabFolder
PDE editors (schema and feature) use CTabFolder inside a page. When the page
is made narrow enough, some tabs are dropped but there is no way to access
them (no chevron).
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a new feature project
2) Switch to the 'Information' page in the newly opened feature editor. It
should have three tabs 'Feature description', 'Copyright Notice' and 'License
Agreement'.
3) Make the editor narrower until 'License Agreement' goes away.
4) Observe - there is no way to access the tab.
This is a problem for us because some people already asked as if License
Agreement is not required in 3.0.
