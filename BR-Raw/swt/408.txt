Debug view should not scroll to right when breakpoint is hit
I20080807-1402, was OK in 3.3.2 and 3.4.
Paste the class below to the Package Explorer, set the breakpoint, and then debug as Java application.
When the breakpoint is hit (in both threads), make sure that the Debug view is so narrow that its toolbar just fits on one row (the view then shows a horizontal scroll bar).
Press F8.
=> Was: Tree scrolls to the right
=> Expected: Tree should not scroll horizontally
Even when you drag the thumb to the left, pressing F8 always scrolls to the right again.
