[Browser] Location not browsed when URL misses protocol / www
Hi,
I am using the Browser widget with a location text field, that calls setUrl()
with the content from the text field after the default selection event occures.
This is hitting the Enter key.
Entering URLs that miss "http://" and "www." do not seem to work then. For
example, I entered "heise.de" and hit the Enter key. Nothing happend. Then
after entering " http://www.heise.de " and hitting Enter, the page was loading.
I was working on a G5 using current Mac OS X version.
