StyledText's font appears inconsistent with GC.drawString(..) font
TextConsoleViewer (org.eclipse.ui.console plugin) uses GC.drawString(..) to change the color of an
active console hyperlink. On mac this appears to change the fonts character spacing (ie the same string
takes up more space).
Code was just released to HEAD today.  Please see TextConsoleViewer.paintControl(..)
Will attach screen shot.
