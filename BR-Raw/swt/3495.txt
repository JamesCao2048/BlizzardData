3 mouse clicks cause 4 mouseDown events
I've got a Canvas that has a MouseAdapter listening for mouseDown events, and a
fast triple-click under swt-gtk-2.1.2 generates 4 mouseDown events.
I'm using
this code:
canvas.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
public void mouseDown(MouseEvent e) {
System.out.println("Click");
}
});
This generates an output with four "Click" messages.
I have not seen this
behavior for anything except triple-clicking.
I notice that there appears to be
a similiar bug registered under  bug #43916 , but that one is for version 3.0.
