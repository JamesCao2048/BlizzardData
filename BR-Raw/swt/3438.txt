[SWT Examples] 鈥淪ave As鈥 Dialog of Image Analyzer does not provide the correct file path
When I tried to save an image by selecting 鈥淔ile
-> Save As鈥 from the main
menu of the Image Analyzer application, the 鈥淪ave As鈥 dialog provided me with
the following file path in the selection
field: /alfred2/home/swijenay/images2//alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png
The correct file path should have been the following:
/alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png
Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario:
1.Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11.
2.Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from
http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse
-
examples-3.0M7.zip and install them.
3.Launch Eclipse
4.Select 鈥淲indow
-> Show View
-> Other鈥︹.
This will launch the 鈥淪how View鈥
Dialog.
5.From the 鈥淪how View鈥 Dialog, select 鈥淪WT Examples
-> SWT Example Launcher鈥.
This will launch the 鈥淪WT Example Launcher鈥 View.
6.In the 鈥淓xamples鈥 group, expand 鈥淪tandalone鈥 category, select 鈥淚mage
Analyzer鈥 from the list and press 鈥淩un鈥 button.
This will launch the 鈥淚mage
Analyzer鈥 application.
7.Open an image file and then attempt to save it by selecting 鈥淔ile
- > Save
As鈥 from the main menu of the application.
Expected Behavior: 鈥淪ave As鈥 dialog pops up.
Its selection field should
contain the correct file path.
In my case, it should have been the
following: /alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png
Actual Behavior: The provided file path is invalid.
In my attempt, the
following was the file path it provided:
/alfred2/home/swijenay/images2//alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png
