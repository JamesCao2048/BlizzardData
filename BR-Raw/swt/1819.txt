Some convenience methods for StyledText
Hello,
I would appreciate some convenience methods in the StyledText-API.
For instance, In an application I like to get the contents of a certain line.
At the moment I can't see a method with which this would conveniently possible.
At least a method get the offset of a end of line would be helpful here (currently, I have to get the index of the following line and then subtract one but I have to take care about boundary issues myself).
