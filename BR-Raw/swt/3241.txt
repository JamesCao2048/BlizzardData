No lower border on swt combo boxes
Build: I-20040810-1200
This happens in 3.1 builds, but not 3.0 builds.
On WinXP with the manifest.exe
Some combo boxes do not show the bottom blue border.
I will attach screen shots that show the plug-in export wizard, where one
combo box exhibits this behavior and the other two are fine.
Another example where you would see this behavior is the Team > Commit...
dialog.
