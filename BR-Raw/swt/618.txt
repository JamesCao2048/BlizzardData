Internal fixes for StyledText (getWordNext() and getWordPrevious())
Created  attachment 169391   [details]
patch
StyledText has two helping methods to return the next or previous word stop given a offset.
We need to make sure these methods work fine when the given offset is at or in the middle of line delimiter.
Although theses cases do not happen in StyledText directly they do happen for accessibility.
Please test patch in win32/gtk and cocoa if possible.
