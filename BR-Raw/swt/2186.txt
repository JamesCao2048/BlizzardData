[Program] Error when opening word and excel documents
To reproduce using Word:
- Set external editor for .doc files to "Microsoft Word Document" in file association preferences
- Select a word document in Navigator (file can be linked or directly contained within the project) and open
- Word will open but displays an error "Word experienced an error trying to open the file" and file file is not loaded
Looking at Program.execute (String fileName) the above steps result in the following command being executed:
"C:Program FilesMicrosoft OfficeOFFICE11WINWORD.EXE" /n /ddeC:
Documents and SettingsRobert ElvesMy Documentsmydocument.doc
Aside from the missing space which appears to be causing this error, lack of quotes around the file path may also be problematic.

Note that the document does open externally without error if Open With...System Editor is used.
