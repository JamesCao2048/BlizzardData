First characters in Text initially not displayed
Hi,
In a newly drawed combobox, the first character of the displayed text doesn't
appear. If I select the combobox and press Pos1, it looks fine. A place where
this bug occurs is the feature.xml editor in the section information. I'll
post a screenshot too.
