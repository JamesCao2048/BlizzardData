[widgets] nicer truncation of Table/Tree items
Table/TreeItems that are too long for their columns currently get truncated at the column bound.  Other OSX apps tend to use "..." in this case, either at the "end" of the string (eg.- iTunes), or in the middle (eg.- Finder).  Perhaps swt's custom Table/Tree data cell should do something similar.
