Table, Tree, List send DefaultSelection when double-click in header
- run the snippet below and observe that DefaultSelection events are incorrectly received if you double-click in the header or in the Table's whitespace
- Tree and List have the same problem
- this creates some strange behaviours in eclipse
- also note that the DefaultSelection event never has its item field set (it should for Table and Tree)
