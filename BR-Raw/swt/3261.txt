org.eclipse.swt.tools.internal.SwtJniGen is not working properly
Jni generator uses org.eclipse.swt.internal.Platform claas to determine
platform.
This class is not part of SWT package for amd64 it generates it still
thinks that platform is win32.This is happening due to swttools.jar is built
using win32 platform and final PLATFORM string is inline into swttools.jar.
So I
had to rebuild swttools.jar and make some dances to feed proper Platform.java.
I suggest passing platform attribute to ant task org.eclipse.swt.tools.internal.
SwtJniGen so swttool.jar has no dependency on org.eclipse.swt.internal.Platform
