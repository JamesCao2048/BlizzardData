JS evaluating asynchronously with XULRunner 10
The default code path in Mozilla.execute() is failing with XULRunner 10, which is causing it to fall back to the "pre-1.9" approach.  For some JS evaluations this is fine but not for all, so getting the main part of Mozilla.execute() to work with XULRunner 10 is important.  I believe it's caused by native interfaces that have changed between XULRunner 3.6.x and 10.0.
Note that SWT includes two header files, nsIScriptContext.h and nsIScriptGlobalObject.h, that make it possible to compile the natives that are used here with XULRunner 1.8.x.  It's possible that these hacked header files may need to change if these natives have changed in XULRunner 10.
