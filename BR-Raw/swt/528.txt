Follow-up to  bug 273354 , see that bug and attachment in  bug 273354 comment 0  for steps to reproduce.
The FF no longer makes the following lines right-aligned, but it makes the lines after the FF move upwards by one when the caret is moved to after the FF.
The effect can more easily be seen when you select characters with Shift+Arrow_Right.
