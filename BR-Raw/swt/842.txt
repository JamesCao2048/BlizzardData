Use GTK_STOCK_CLEAR instead of GTK_STOCK_CANCEL for Text ICON_* hinting support
From looking at gtk-demo, I don't think GTK_STOCK_CANCEL was the right choice for implementing  bug 281352 .
1. $ gtk-demo
2. Expand 'Entry' on the left.
3. Double-click on 'Search Entry'.
4. See that it uses the GTK_STOCK_CLEAR stock icon instead of the GTK_STOCK_CANCEL icon.
We should in my opinion be in line with GNOME's advertised images.
