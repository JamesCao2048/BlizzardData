Setting table selection does not update anchor index
SWT v3.1.0.9, Win32
In the testcase below, there is a multi-selection table with ten items.
The item at index 4 is selected programmatically.
Shift+Click on, let's say, item 6 or press Shift+ArrowDown twice.
Expected result:
Items 4-6 should be selected.
Actual result:
Items 0-6 are selected.
What seems to be happening here is that (programmatically) setting
the table selection does not update the anchor index that is used
as the starting point when a range selection is performed.
Instead, the table uses whatever item the user has selected
previously or the item at index 0 if the user has not yet selected
anything.
This is problematic; in the testcase, item 4 is the only selected
item initially and it has the focus rectangle too, so the user can
reasonably expect that extending the selection range will begin
at that item. And it does, but only if the user has selected the item
manually, not when it's done via a Table.setSelection(...) call.
Programmatic and manual selection should, where possible, result in
the same adjustment of the anchor index/item.
