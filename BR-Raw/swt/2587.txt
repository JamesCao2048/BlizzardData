Cheese in StyledText on Linux
I20051213-0010, GTK+ 2.2.4, pango 1.2.5.
See attached screenshot.
When clicking around in the Java editor, the lines "shimmer" and often jump up and down.
The root cause seems to be the use of TextLayout.getLineHeight(int) to handle dynamic line heights.
Special casing fixedLineHeight mode in StyledTextRenderer.drawLine() seems to work around the problem.
