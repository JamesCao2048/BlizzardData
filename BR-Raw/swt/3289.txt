Editor drop down performance slow on Linux-GTK on mouse move
I wonder if the fix to  bug 44915  introduced a performance regression.  I'm using
I20040513 GTK and the UI is sluggish in a number of places.  The most apparent
is when using the "Open Editor Drop Down" command to bring up the list of open
editors.
1.  Open 5 or so files.
2.  Open Editor Drop Down.
3.  Move the mouse cursor up and down over the list of editors quickly a few times.
Notice that the highlighting of the list elements trails behind the mouse
movement significantly.  That is, if I move the mouse over the first, then
second, then third, etc. editor in the list and then reverse the direction back
up to the first editor in the list, the highlight moves from the first to the
second to the third, etc., but it lags behind the mouse.
This kind of behavior seems suspiciously likely to be a result of queuing UI
events, as I understand the fix for 44915 does.
