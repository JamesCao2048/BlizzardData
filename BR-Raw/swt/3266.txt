Combobox computeSize() doesn't take the down arrow into account
When performing a computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT) on a combobox, the size
adjusts properly minus the size of the drop down arrow!  When this arrow is
pressed, the list is the appropriate size for all items.  If the largest item is
selected, and displayed when "rolled up" then the full text cannot be seen.
I don't know if this happens in 2.1.2 or higher since I am using 2.1.1 at this time.
