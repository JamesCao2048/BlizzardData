Combo and Text#setSelection(int, int) does not handle start > end with SWT.SINGLE
I20050803-0800
In a Text widget with text "abc", the behavior of #setSelection(int, int)
depends on whether the flag SWT.SINGLE is set.
- with SWT.SINGLE, setSelection(3,1) sets the caret to position 3
- without SWT.SINGLE, setSelection(3,1) sets the caret to position 1
The second behavior should also apply for the SWT.SINGLE case. This would also
match the documented behavior of StyledText#setSelection(int, int).
