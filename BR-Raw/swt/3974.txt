Function key events are often lost
Build 20020820 (and some earlier)
SWT-GTK seems to lose a lot of function key events.
This problem is very obvious
in the debugger where it often takes two key strokes to perform actions like
stepping (F5, F6, F7) and resuming (F8).
The same problem exists in the editor
with F3.
