[Browser] Browser leaks due to COM objects
Build ID: I20070601-1539
Steps To Reproduce:
While analyzing memory dumps from an RCP application I noticed there were 321 instances of WebSite retained in memory.
The WebSites are retained due to org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.COMObject#ObjectMap.
I was able to recreate a standalone testcase that shows this happens when a browser's setText method is called and doesn't happen when the method isn't called.
