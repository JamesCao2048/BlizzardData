patch to make IAccessible2 inherit from IAccessible
The NVDA screen reader does not read StyledText very well at all.
Through a conversation with one of the NVDA developers, I learned that they rely on IAccessible2 inheriting from IAccessible (which the IA2 spec says they should not rely on).
The attached patch turns on IAccessible inheritance in an IAccessible2 object, which makes the Eclipse Java editor accessible with NVDA.
