SWT printing snippet not working on MacOS X
I'm currently working with a few people on a SWT project where printing is needed. We are developing
for the MacOS X 10.3.3 platform. Currently we're having trouble in implementing swt printing in our
project. We then looked for some examples on swt printing and found this:  http://dev.eclipse.org/
viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-swt-home/snippits/snippet132.html?rev=1.3&content-
type=text/plain . We tried to run this on our target platform but were not successfull. What we get is
the following NullPointerException on stringExtent():
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
at org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.setString(GC.java:2033)
at org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.textExtent(GC.java:2145)
at org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.stringExtent(GC.java:2085)
at Main.main(Main.java:45)
We also tried to run the example without getExtent() and failed also with a NullPointerException on
drawString() . Are there any issues with GC on MacOS X? On a win32 machine everything worked fine.
Are there any fixes for this? We are really pressed with this and would be glad if there was a bugfix or
some help with this issue. Also, would it be possible to use AWT printing in a SWT project?
