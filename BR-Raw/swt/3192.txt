TableColumn.pack() calculates wrong size in TableTrees
I think that TableColumn.pack calculates the wrong size if all these conditions
are given in a TableTree:
columnindex==0
image of biggest item in column==null
columwidth>headerwidth
and some other item in this column has an image
Reasoning: If the columnwidth is bigger than the header width, then the column
width is used as result.
Only if the column header has an image, then the width
for the image is added to the column width.
But this addition must also be done
if at least one of the items in the column has an image.
The attached screenshot shows the first table column of a table tree.
The upper
part was taken after calling pack() for the column, the lower part was taken
after packing and incrementing the column width by the width of the image in the
first row.
