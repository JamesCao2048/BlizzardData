Tree widgets leaked due to TreeColumn's modelhandle reference in Display.widgetTable
Build Identifier: Version: 3.7.1.v3738a
issue is only on Linux platforms (Linux,Solaris, ..etc)
not seen in windows platform
Tree keep 5 reference for each handle in Display. out of which modelhandle reference is not released when Tree disposed.
1. modehandle add Tree reference to Display.widgetTable through
Display.addWidget()
2. when TreeColumn is created in Tree. modelHandle is replaced.
3. Tree reference in Display.widgetTable is not released
is causing disposed Tree widgets never garbage collected.
640 		if (modelIndex == modelLength) {
641			int /*long*/ oldModel = modelHandle;
642			int /*long*/[] types = getColumnTypes (columnCount + 4); // grow by 4 rows at a time
643			int /*long*/ newModel = OS.gtk_tree_store_newv (types.length, types);
644			if (newModel == 0) error (SWT.ERROR_NO_HANDLES);
645			copyModel (oldModel, FIRST_COLUMN, newModel, FIRST_COLUMN, types, (int /*long*/)0, (int /*long*/)0, modelLength);
646			OS.gtk_tree_view_set_model (handle, newModel);
647			OS.g_object_unref (oldModel);
648			modelHandle = newModel;
}
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create Tree with 2 or more TreeColumn
2. dispose Tree / recreate Tree
3. check heap dump. disposed Tree is referenced in Display.widgetTable
