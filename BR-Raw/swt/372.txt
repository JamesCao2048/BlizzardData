[Browser] WebKit and XULRunner-1.9.2.x crash due to incompatible SQLLite libs
- 3.7M7
- install XULRunner 1.9.2.x and Safari on Windows
- run ControlExample, go to the Browser tab
- choose the SWT.WEBKIT checkbox

-> demo browser changes to WebKit renderer
- choose the SWT.MOZILLA checkbox

-> a prompter is shown with error message "...your version of SQLLite is too old..."

-> after pressing OK the app crashes
- only happens if XULRunner version is 1.9.2.x, and only if WebKit is loaded before it (choosing SWT.MOZILLA and then SWT.WEBKIT works fine)
- XULRunner ships its own SQLLite lib, so it is likely getting sad when the one used by WebKit has already been loaded
