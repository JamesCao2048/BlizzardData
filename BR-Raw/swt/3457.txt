[SWT Examples] CoolBar Buttons with a dropdown menu do not behave correctly
When I was going through the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples-
3.0M7.zip) which I downloaded from
http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse
-
examples-3.0M7.zip, I realized that the CoolBar buttons with a dropdown menu
did not behave correctly.

Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario:
1.Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11.
2.Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from
http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse
-
examples-3.0M7.zip and install them.
3.Launch Eclipse
4.Select 鈥淲indow
-> Show View
-> Other鈥︹.
This will launch the 鈥淪how View鈥
Dialog.
5.From the 鈥淪how View鈥 Dialog, select 鈥淪WT Examples
-> SWT Controls鈥.
This
will display 鈥淪WT Controls鈥 View.
6.From SWT Controls View, select 鈥淐oolBar鈥 tab.
7.Chose a button with a dropdown menu.
These buttons have a down arrow (/)
next to their icons.
8.Click on the down arrow (/) of the button to extend its dropdown menu.
Expected Behavior: The drop down menu is extended
Actual Behavior: The drop down menu is not extended until the down arrow of
the button 鈥榎/鈥 is clicked for the second time.
Note: Do not select the items from the dropdown menu of the selected button.
Important: When I ran the same tests on Eclipse 2.1.2, the outcome was the
same as it was on Eclipse 3.0M7.
