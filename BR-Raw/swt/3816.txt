StyledText - StyleRange hashCode throws NullPointerException
The implementation of StyleRange's hashCode method assumes the object has a
foreground and background color.
This is a bad assumption.
When trying to
put StyleRanges without a foreground or background color into a java.util.Set,
a NullPointerException is thrown.
