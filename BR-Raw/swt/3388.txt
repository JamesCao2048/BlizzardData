[EditorMgmt] Immortal editor tab tooltips
I2004-03-26:08:00h
While trying to reproduce  bug 56365 , I got stuck with three editor tab (I use
the option to use multiple tabs got editors) tooltips.
The seem to be live
widgets, I can click each of them to get them to the front.
They just don't go
away anymore (even though there's no editor open anymore).
I can't reproduce how I got into this state, though.
