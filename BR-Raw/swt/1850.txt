TitleAreaDialog's banner image has extraneous white borders
Created  attachment 79046   [details]
Image to display the extra border padding.
Reproduced on I20070920-0936 in 32-bit Vista Business and 32-bit XP SP2.
1. Click the 'New Java Class' icon in the toolbar.
2. The 'New Java Class' wizard appears.
3. Notice that there is a white border that's maybe five pixels wide surrounding the banner image. See attachment for further clarification.
This does not appear on the regular win32 build reproduced. It can also be seen in the 'About Dialog' which subclasses ProductInfoDialog which subclasses TrayDialog.
