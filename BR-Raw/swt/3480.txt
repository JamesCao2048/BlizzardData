Text#getCaretLocation() sends erroneous Modify event
When I call Text#getCaretLocation(), the implementation sends two
OS.EM_REPLACESEL messages.
Both of them cause an execution of sendEvent
(SWT.Modify), which can cause unexpected behavior in client code listening to
"true" modify events.
The two modify events (adding a space character, and removing it) should not be
sent out.
