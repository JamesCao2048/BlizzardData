Remove GtkCombo and friends.

The patch.
The attached patch is removing GtkCombo and related functions which are using only for pre gtk 2.4.0 which is unsupported by latest SWT.
The patch looks way bigger than it is actually, thanks to jnigen changes which I decided to include in order to have proper git-formatted patch (appliable with git am).
Build and tested locally without any problems seen (gtk 2.24)
