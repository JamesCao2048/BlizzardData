Image flashing when using a Tree in a themed TabFolder
If you have a themed TabFolder under XP (using the latest SWT release that fixes
some TabFolder theme problems, see  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi ?
id=24538) and uses a Tree with images as a TabItem control, resizing the Shell
causes massive flashing of the Tree images (similar to the flashing of images in
Labels that was fixed in the SWT release mentioned above).
