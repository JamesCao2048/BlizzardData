PNG images look corrupt as main window icon
I am using 3.1 M7.When I load a 16*16 PNG file as an image and display it on
a canvas all is well.
When I set the same image to top level shell I see a
corrupt image in the top left corner of the window.
The issue seems to be
related to the handling of transparent and semi-transparent pixels.
