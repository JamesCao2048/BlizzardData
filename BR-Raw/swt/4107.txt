Vertical Scrollbar clipped
Eclipse F1
Synchronize a file that has outoging changes.
Select the file so that the Java Source Compare is visibile.
There is a scrollbar on the far right hand side of the Java Source Compare and
it is clipped.
I am not sure if SWT is giving the wrong answer for the width of teh scrollbar
or if Java Source Compare is just guessing the width.
