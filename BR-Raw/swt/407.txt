[Presentations] [perfs] Performance regression in PresentationCreateTest* tests
On windows, there is 30-50% performance regression in tests of org.eclipse.ui.tests.performance.presentations.PresentationCreateTest#*. Linux looks good.
The regression seems to have got introduced around 6th January. There was a regression in December first but it got good on 4th January build. Hence, I initially thought it was noise but it has been consistent since then.
