[CellEditors] ComboBoxCellEditor doesn't work properly (CCombo)
Eclipse Version: 3.4M5
OS: Windows XP
It works well in older version, but doesn't in this one.
I used ComboBoxCellEditor in a table, and sometimes it doesn't work.
In the table, click the cell, sometimes the triangle at right is shown, and sometimes is hidden.
When the triangle is shown, I select an item in the list, it works.
But if the triangle is hidden, I select one, it can't be selected.
After studying the code, I find that in the condition the triangle is hidden, if I select an item, CellModifier.CanModify() won't be invoked, and none of method in CellModifier will be called. Obviously, it's a bug.
To simplify the question, you can see this file
org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet027ComboBoxCellEditors.java,
and change
v.setCellEditors(new CellEditor[] { new ComboBoxCellEditor(
v.getTable(), new String[] { "Zero", "Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty","Fourty", "Fifty", "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty","Ninety" }) });
to
v.setCellEditors(new CellEditor[] { new ComboBoxCellEditor(
v.getTable(), new String[] { "Zero", "Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty","Fourty", "Fifty", "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty","Ninety" },SWT.READ_ONLY) });
After doing that, you can reproduce this bug easily.
