Mnemonic collision in Show view menu
Build id: I20051122-0800
To open views, I frequently use the key sequence "Alt+W,V,O" For Window > Show View > Other...  Recently (I'm not sure when), this began instead selecting the Outline view when that is available in the menu.  There shouldn't be two menu entries with the "O" mnemonic.
