Extreme performance degradation in TextLayout.shape()
I20080522-1800.
I accidentally opened a small binary file (81KB) in the text editor which resulted in a very long freeze (40-50s).
Afterwards typing, selecting etc.
is unusably slow.
Performance tracing reveals that all time is spent in TextLayout.shape().
Note that this is a huge regression compared to R3.3.x: there the file opens immediately and the editor is responsive.
1.download attached test file
2.add it to a workspace
3.open it with the default text editor
