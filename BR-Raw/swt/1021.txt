[KeyBindings] copy/paste doesn't always work in dialogs
It seems that pasting into a dialog doesn't always work.
To reproduce follow these steps exactly:
# open an editor (of almost any kind, as long as it's a text editor)
# in the package explorer view from the context menu select 'copy qualified name'
# use the *Search
-> File* function, and attempt to paste into the *Containing Text* editable combo
## observe that it doesn't work
# close the dialog
# paste into the editor that we opened previously
## observe that the paste succeeds
# now open the search dialog again, and paste as before
## observe that paste works as expected
