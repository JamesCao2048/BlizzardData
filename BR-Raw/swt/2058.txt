More information:
I've reproduced on a couple of machines.
On others, it doesn't happen.
So I don't know how to attach an image.
I will describe the popup dialog message:
Title: Java(TM) Plug-in Fatal Error
Cannot load class sun/plugin/JavaRuntime.
The Bridge was installed at
<c:progra~1JavaJ2RE14~1.2_0> but the class is not there
Modify the registry key to reflect the new bridge location
The key is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREJavaSoftJava Plug-in or change your classpath to include the new directory
please consult the documentation for more information.
