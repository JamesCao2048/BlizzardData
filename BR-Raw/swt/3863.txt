Extra separator line drawn in emulated CoolBar
It looks like the right-most CoolItem in an emulated CoolBar displays a separator line on the left hand edge.
This is true regardless of whether or not the CoolBar is "locked".
This behavior does not match the native look&feel on either windows or macosx.
