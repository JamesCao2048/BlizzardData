StyledText: text selection with key 'arrow down' does not include last line
How to reproduce:
Start Eclipse.
Open a java file.
Set the cursor somewhere in the file (not at the end).
While keeping 'Shift' down, press the 'arrow down' repeatedly until the cursor
goes to the bottom of the file.
>> the last line is not selected. The selection stops at the line just before.
Other IDE's would move the cursor to the last character of the last line, and
the selection would include everything to the end of the file.
('Select All' and Mouse selection work ok)
