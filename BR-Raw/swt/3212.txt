Textlayout does not render multiline text correctly
When I run code with the following snippet, the first time when Chinese
characters appears, TextLayout renders that line very well. However for the
subsequent lines, Textlayout just shows boxes.
It is not a font problem, Textlayout can show the first line perfectly. All
the characters in the subsequent lines are just repition of the first line.
////////////////////// The code /////////////////////////
TextLayout layout = new TextLayout(Display.getCurrent());
layout.setWidth(200);

layout.setText("This is a test.This is a test.This is u65E5
u672Cu8A9Eu65E5u672Cu8A9Eu65E5u672Cu8A9Eu65E5

u672Ca test.This is a test.Thisn is a test.");
layout.draw(gc, 10, 10);
