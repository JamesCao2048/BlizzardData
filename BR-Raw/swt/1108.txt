[Browser] JS->Java call can crash due to freeing of args
- use xulrunner 1.9.0.6
- run the TestExternal test
- press the button in the third Browser
- create a JS Function
- press the button in the third Browser again
- crash happens, one of the traces indicated that it was happening in Free

-> removing all Frees from Mozilla.convertJStoJava() made the crash stop happening

-> need to investigate whether something(s) should not be freed, or if memory management is not being done properly (eg.- should nsIMemory be used instead?)
