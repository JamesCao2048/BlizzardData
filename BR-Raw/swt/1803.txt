[Contributions] [Contributions] view menu remains after invoking item
M4
If you activate any view menu item the view menu flickers away and comes back just as it was before.
For instance, open the view menu of the Problems view and choose Configure Contents.
After the dialog is opened, dismiss it, and you'll see the menu pop back into focus.
