Launch Configurations dialog creeps up
Eclipse F2
Linux Motif (KDE)
Each time I hit Run
-> Run...
to edit a launch configuration, the dialog pops
up a little bit higher than the last time it appeared.
Eventually it goes off
the top of the screen.
If I exit Eclipse and come back in, it is still off the
screen.
Does not happen on Windows 2000.
