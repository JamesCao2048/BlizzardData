List control does not allow 0th item to be deselected.
List.deselect says:
public void deselect (int index) {
checkWidget();
if (0 < index && index < itemCount) {
int [] ids = new int [] {index + 1};
deselect (ids, ids.length);
}
}
It should be:
public void deselect (int index) {
checkWidget();
if (0 <= index && index < itemCount) {
int [] ids = new int [] {index + 1};
deselect (ids, ids.length);
}
}
I had to work around the problem by deselecting everything, then reselecting everything but the 0th item.
