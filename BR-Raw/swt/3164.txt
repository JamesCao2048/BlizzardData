Rename refactoring wizard butchers clipboard

If one does a rename (noticed this with a class, but probably affects all
"renamable" artifacts), then the contents of the "New Name" field gets put into
the clipboard, erasing what was there previously.  This, IMHO, is Not Good (ie/
Very Bad (TM)).
To reproduce:
- copy something.
- paste (to prove to yourself that that's what the clipboard contains)
- start a rename (right-click on a class, Refactor->Rename).
- No need to complete the rename, just hit cancel.
- try pasting again -- notice that what you are pasting is the contents of the
"New Name" field.
