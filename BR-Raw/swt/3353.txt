TableItem.getImageBounds() returns incorrect value for Column 0
I have a Table with two columns.
The second column contains an image.
The
Table also has a TableEditor defined for it.
When the TableEditor.computeBounds() method attempts to compute the size for
Column 0, it gets an incorrect value.
When computeBounds() calls
TableItem.getImageBounds(), it should get a zero sized rectangle, since there
is no image for this column.
But if any column in the Table has an image, it
gets a non-zero rectangle instead.
There is a comment in TableItem:
/*
* Feature in Windows.
LVM_GETSUBITEMRECT returns a small width
* value even when the subitem does not contain an image.
The
* fix is to set the width to zero.
*/
if (index != 0 && images != null & images [index] == null) {
width = 0;
}
But this patch doesn't work if the column is 0. So the incorrect sized
rectangle is returned and TableEditor creates a editor widget for the cell with
an incorrect size.
The code works fine if the table contains no images.
