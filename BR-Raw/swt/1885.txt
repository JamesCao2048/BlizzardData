Mnemonics should not turn on until ALT is pressed
In normal Windows apps, the focus rectangles are not drawn until the user initiates some keyboard navigation.
Mnemonics are also not drawn until the user presses ALT (and ALT also turns on focus rects).
In SWT Shells (and I believe since the work for  bug 118709 ), initiating a keyboard nav will cause not just focus rects to appear but also mnemonics.
