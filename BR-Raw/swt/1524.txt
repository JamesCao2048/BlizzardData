Label.setText() hides the label if called multiple times

a candidate for solution
Calling label.setText() more than one time makes the label disappear.
For example:
{...
label.setText("foo");
...
}
{
...
// somewhere in other place, a bit later
label.setText("bar"); // the label disappears
...
}
After doing some experiments, I had found that removing "((NSBox)view).setContentView(textView);" from the setText() fixes the bug.
So the following lines:
if (((NSBox)view).contentView().id != textView.id)
((NSBox)view).setContentView(textView);
seems to be an appropriate solution.
I've attached a patch, however I need to note that I don't understand the reason of the problem clearly (Cocoa bug?).
Thus any thoughts about the reason would be valuable.
