StyleText displays StyleRanges incorrect depending on order of StyleRange in array
I've been fighting with a bug which I believe was in my code, but now I feel it
is in the StyleText code.
Basically if I create a array of StyleRange and use setStyleRanges() then the
styles are not applied correctly if the start position of each style is not in
numerical order.
A easy example is this:
StyleRange[] ranges = new StyleRange[3];
//This works fine
ranges[0] = new StyleRange(0, 2, black, red);
ranges[1] = new StyleRange(3, 2, black, blue);
ranges[2] = new StyleRange(6, 2, black, red);
//This doesn't, the 2nd red isn't applied
ranges[0] = new StyleRange(0, 2, black, red);
ranges[1] = new StyleRange(6, 2, black, red);
ranges[2] = new StyleRange(3, 2, black, blue);
I've attached source code for a small sample program showing the problem...
I've made sure the above sample doesn't have overlapping region (with each
style being one character apart).
I have no fixed my code by making sure the StyleRanges are in start order
before I setStyleRanges.
I have only tested this on Windows XP, SWT 3.0 (build 3062)
If you need any more information please contact me.
Thanks
