Crash in ScriptStringOut
Created  attachment 106469   [details]
Hotspot's error log file
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Use Eclipse for some time.
No particular action is associated with the crash as it happens from time to time.
2.Eclipse crashes the VM in the method org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.ScriptStringOut, producing a hs_err_pid file.
More information:
This happened most recently for me when updating files from CVS.
However, given the stack trace is definitely not in the CVS code, I would imagine it's more of an SWT issue.
I will attach the log file.
