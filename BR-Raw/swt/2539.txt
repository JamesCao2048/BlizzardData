Implement RichText editor for SWT
The RCP will be a great platform for many different products. Some products
will need an richtext editor (e.g. Email client, CRM products, Helpdesk
systems, ...).
The best way would be, if the eclipse project provided an richtext editor. The
Look&Feel of the products would be similar and the machine resources would be
less used.
Needed Features:
-> Multiline editor
-> Different Fonts (include: Bold, Underline, Italic)
-> Different colors (Foreground, Background)
-> The text could contain Bullets (and enumeration)
-> The text could contain Tables
-> The text could contain Images
-> The text could contain Attachments
Data API:
-> Get and set HTML
-> Get and set MIME multipart (including HTML, Images and Attachments)
