Race conditions in Device.getDevice() method
Method org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Device.getDevice() is static and uses static
variables (CurrentDevice). In application with several GUI threads it is
possible (and it happens) that two or more GUI threads access Device.getDevice()
method simultaneously. This leads to situation when getDevice(), called from one
thread returns null because getDevice() in another thread set CurrentDevice
variable to null.
