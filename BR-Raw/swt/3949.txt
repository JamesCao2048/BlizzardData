Eclipse crashes when pasting URL in Java-code
This is repeatable, at least for me. I did the following:
a) Right-click on link in MSIE, select "Copy shortcut". The link I got was the
following:  http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/bycodes.html#U000A9
b) Paste it in notepad, just to check that it was copied OK.
c) Paste it in Eclipse, in the middle of a Java source code file, for further
editing (actually, it's the unicode for the (C) symbol that I wanted...) More
specifically, I pasted it after the first opening { on a class definition,
before the first instance variable declaration.
d) *BANG!* Eclipse dies with a "JVM error -10473247932489324" or something like
that.
e) On restart, I get the following message in the log file. Don't know if
that's really related to the problem, or more to problems during restart.
