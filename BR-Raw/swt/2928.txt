Increase scrolling speed based on distance from the widget
Currently the speed of selection scrolling when using the mouse in StyledText is
fixed.
This means it can take a long time to select large sections of text.
It
would be much better if StyledText increased the selection speed based on the
distance the pointer is from the edge of the StyledText widget.
