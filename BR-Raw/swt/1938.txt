Scale widget freaks out if layout() is called from a selection listener.
Build ID:  M20070212-1330
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Create a Scale widget and attach a selection listener which calls getParent().layout() on the Scale.
2.When clicking on the designated paging area the Scale now transitions all the values up to the value under the mouse instead of only the page increment as it should.
3.Removing the layout() call will restore the correct behaviour.
More information:
It seems that a call to layout during event processing generates a whole series of selection events, not ending until the value under the mouse has been reached.
For some strange reason you only get a couple of events (but still too many...) if you debug.
Probably because the focus of the window is stolen by the IDE once it hits the breakpoint.
This problem does not occur with, for example, the Slider widget although one might expect them to exhibit similar characteristics.
