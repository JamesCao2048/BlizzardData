Negative zoom factor reported from magnification gesture on Mac OS X
The magnification as reported by SWT in GestureEvent.magnification on OS X can become negative if you pinch (zoom out) sufficiently within a single gesture.
As this is a zoom factor, it should never be negative.
(This is an extreme example that the SWT reported magnification factor doesn't correspond to the actual movement of the fingers.
If you move the fingers from 10 cm apart to 5 cm apart, the magnification factor should be around 0.5.The speed of the gesture shouldn't matter, but in SWT it does.)
This can easily be viewed in Snippet 353:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/tree/examples/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet353.java
When this happens, the rectangle flips so that it is above and to the left of the fixed corner, instead of below and to the right (unless you've rotated it).
It can also be seen by adding this line to the handling of SWT.GESTURE_MAGNIFY:
System.out.println("Magnification: " + ge.magnification);
The fix is so simple, I won't even create a patch for it.
Instead, in org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control.gestureEvent(...) replace
display.magnification += nsEvent.magnification();
with
display.magnification *= (1.0 + nsEvent.magnification());
It seems the current implementation took the description from
http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSEvent/magnification
far too literally.
