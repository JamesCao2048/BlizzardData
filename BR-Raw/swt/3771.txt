TabFolder title does not handle mnemonics properly
RC2, running on SuSE with gtk2.0.6
- open Eclipse's Preferences dialog, go to page Java - Compiler
- the third tab on the page should say "Compliance & Classfiles", but instead
appears as "Compliance _ Classfiles"
- verified this works fine on win32, motif and photon
