StyledText doesn't report a text style when requesting the end of the line.
In StyledText's implementation of getTextAttributes() at line 6712 (roughly) it's possible for the method to return without returning a TextStyle object in e.textStyle.
On the Mac this causes VoiceOver to interpret a line ending as a font change because the character before and character after have font information returned for them.
Fix is simple
-- just add
e.textStyle = new TextStyle(st.getFont(), st.foreground, st.background);
before the return on line 6715.
