Checkbox in Tree or Table ignores second click of double click
When clicking quickly and repeatedly on a checkbox of a Tree or Table control
which was created with style SWT.CHECK, every second click is ignored if it is
made within the double click timeout.
This can be tested, for example, with Snippet113.
Some native Table controls (or at least controls used by Windows) show the same
behaviour (e.g.
Control Panel
-> Add or Remove Programs
-> Add/Remove Windows
Components), others do not (e.g.
in Tweak UI).
The only (seemingly) native Tree
control that I could find (in Windows Explorer: Tools
-> Folder Options
-> View)
does not ignore the second click.
IMHO ignoring the second click in Table controls is a bug in Windows (at least
in some parts of it; TweakUI gets it right) and SWT should work around it.
The
same goes for Tree controls (if it's really a bug in Windows; The only Tree
control that I could find didn't have that bug).
