embedded browser cache does not reset
Once a local filesystem image is viewed once in an embedded Browser widget, it is cached and never updated
To reproduce:
# Open the Mylyn WikiText file editor on the Mylyn WikiText User Guide.textile
# switch to the preview tab
# scroll to view a portion of the document that has an image
# replace the local file that backs the image viewed
# close the editor
# reopen the editor, switching to preview again
# observe that the image displayed is the same one as first observed, not the new image
In Carbon repeating this scenario would result in the new image being displayed
