[Accessibility] StyledText selection incorrect after caret moved event
Eclipse 3.6.1 RC2.
One of the JAWS developers sent me an email saying IAccessibleText::selection in StyledText was incorrect after he received a "caret moved" event.
It turns out that this is because JAWS runs in-process, and StyledText does indeed send "caret moved" before finalizing the selection.
When testing with AccProbe running out-of-process, this discrepancy went unnoticed, because the selection is finalized before an out-of-process client can ask for it.
