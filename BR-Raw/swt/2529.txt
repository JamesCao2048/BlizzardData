No longer possible to capture screen with new GC(display)
I think this is a regression. I do as follows:
GC gc = new GC(display);
Image image = new Image(display, shell.getSize().x, shell.getSize().y);
gc.copyArea(image, shell.getLocation().x, shell.getLocation().y);
to copy the contents of the Screen into an Image.
This is working on Windows but not on Mac.
I remember a recent change for Mac that improved performance of creating
a new GC on the Display. Maybe this is a regression? I can confirm that
it worked before.
