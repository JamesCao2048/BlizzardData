file chooser for OSX returns wrong path
When choosing a jar file to include in the library, i can select the jar file
fine but then when i click choose or double click on the file, it returns a
bogus path back to eclipse.
it adds a bunch of random directories at the
begining of the path.
if i try to select the file again it adds more
directories at the begining.
To fix it i edit the .classpath file in the
project directory and manually put in the correct path.
Restart eclipse and my
libraries are there.
Sweet product!  Can't wait for it to be in full swing for OSX!
