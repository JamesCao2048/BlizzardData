Control.print(GC) causes side effects in Windows 7 Aero
Build Identifier: 3.5.1 M20090917-0800
I have a composite with a "StackLayout" and two controls to flip between.
When I perform Control.print(GC) on the two controls, the bottom control can nolonger be seen on the screen.
This doesn't effect the code when run on Windows XP or when Windows 7 is switched to Classic mode.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new java project
2.Copy the following code and create a class SWTImagePrintTest:
----START------------------------------
----END--------------------------------
3.You will need to have SWT libraries available for this project (project properties->Java Build Path->Libraries
4.Run the application
5.Click flip/flop button.
You can see that the composite changes
6.Click "Print"
7.Click the flip/flop button, notice that the other composite is now blank/not being redrawn
8.Show the blank composite
9.Click Print again
10.Note that the top is now blank for both composites.
