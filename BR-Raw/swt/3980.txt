Unexpected KeyDown event after pressing non existing menu mnemonic
build 20020426
Run the test case below.
-press ALT+M to activate the pull down menu
-press a key other than s. A menu item with that mnemonic does not exist
-press ESC twice to back out of the menu
-SWT sends a KeyDown event with the pull down menu mnemonic as the character. I
don't think it should.
