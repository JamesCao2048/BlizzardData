org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text, method append(), bottom focusing error
When appending a line (or multiple) to the text-widget with append(), the last
lines do not get focused.
Contrary to the win32 version, the GTK version always
stays at the top of all lines instead of focusing the bottom when an append()
has been done.
