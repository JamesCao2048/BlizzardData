Build 20021105
Linux-GTK
1.Go to the step filter preference page under
"Window->Java->Debug->Step Filtering"
2.Press alt+f to create a new filter.
An inline editor (a Text) appears.
3.Press alt+f again.
The old editor is removed and a new editor is created.
However, the new editor is smaller than the original editor and there is a
line of garbage drawn under it.
The code responsible for this action is
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.JavaStepFilterPreferencePage.editFilter()
