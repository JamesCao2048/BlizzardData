[Accessibility] Mac: cannot select checkboxes in trees, lists
I have been doing an accessibility check on the Mac and have found that i cannot select checkbox list or tree items by using spacebar or return key.
I have tried both 3.1.1 and 3.2 M3 and get the same result, as follows.
Several examples to try in Eclipse:
1.Import > File System

-tab to directory tree on left, use arrow keys to navigate to an item, attempt to select items in tree using space bar

-tab to file list on right,use arrow keys to navigate to an item, attempt to select items in list using space bar
Result: checkbox is not checked when space bar is used to select
2.Help > Software Updates > Find and install...
> Search for new features to install > Next

-tab to site list, use arrow keys to navigate to an item, attempt to select an item using space bar
Result: not checked
