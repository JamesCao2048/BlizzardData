Combo doesn't take focus by clicking on it (Photon)
Open "Add a new CVS Repository" dialog.
The focus caret
should be in the first Combo "Host:".
Press "Tab" and
focus goes to the second Combo "Repository Path:".
Try
clicking on the first Combo.
It does not take focus
anymore.
If I drop down the combo list, it will take focus.
