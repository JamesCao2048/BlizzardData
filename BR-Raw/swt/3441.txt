[misc] Unacceptably poor performance using Replace dialog under SWT/GTK
This bug report is a fork of bug  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi ?
id=37683
A test have been done to illustrate the completely unacceptable performance of
the Java editor using file plugins/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT
Custom Widgets/common/org/eclipse/swt/custom/StyledText.java
A change of "a" to "a1" took about half an hour on a Linux SuSE 8.2 PC with AMD
2000+ processor with 512 Mb memory.
Eclipse was choking and used over 90% CPU.
The same test on a Windows 2000 PC with AMD 1G processor and 256 Mb memory took
less than 20 seconds.

The issue here is that Eclipse is relying on the Windows version of the
method setRedraw() to throw away all of the individual drawing requests.
This
is interesting issue and needs to be followed up with them.
It may be that
they will not be able to rely on this behavior or that SWT can provide a
partial implementation of setRedraw() to fix this particular problem.
