JRE popup menu in Run configuration dialog not reliable
RC1
- open "Run" dialog
- select any Java Application
- switch to JRE tab
- in JRE popup select a different JRE
Observe: "Apply" button doesn't get enabled; if  "Run" is pressed, application doesn't
launch with selected JRE.
Workaround: select JRE in the popup menu again; in most cases this enabled the
"Apply" button
