Steps To Reproduce:
1.Install Cocoa version of Eclipse on Mac
2.Eclipse > Preferences, Plug-in Development, Target Platform
3.Click "Running Platform" line, then click"Edit..."
4.Click "Environment" tab
Actual result:
The group box at the bottom of the dialog, labeled "Java Runtime Environment," is laid out incorrectly: It is truncated at the bottom.
The moment you begin to resize the dialog, it lays out correctly.
