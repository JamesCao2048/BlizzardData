Link.setText doesn't reset the anchor
(1) call link.setText("<a>some text</a>");
The link is shown in blue color with the underline
(2) now  call link.setText("some text");
The link is still shown the same way although it doesn't have the anchor.
It works fine if you reverse the order of the calls
- the link is not displayed first and then displayed after the second call.
Lakshmi found that it works fine in Windows & Carbon.
So its a Cocoa only bug.
