ColorSelector button does not display correctly when first visible
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20051012-1200
When the ColorSelector control is appears to show the background of the control
behind it.
Pressing the alt key or hovering over the button makes it display
its correct colour.
This can be seen on the ant preference page as well as a few others.
See
attached screenshot.
