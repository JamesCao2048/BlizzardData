Build Identifier: 3.7.2
The URLTransfer does not return the file url correctly and does not decode the url.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. on Mac OS X, create a file on local disk. The file name contains a space, for example, "a b".
2. run  http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/tree/examples/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet284.java  with SWT Cocoa
3. DND the file in to the snippet application.
4. You will find the url is not correctly. It's like file://localhost/Users/linyunz/Desktop/a%b .  The url is not decoded, also it should be file:/localhost/..., but not file://... . This kind of url could not be used by Java URL .
