mouse wheel scrolling in editor moves scrollbar thumb but not content
N20050726-0010
When using the mouse wheel inside an editor in eclipse, the scrollbar's thumb is
moved, but not the StyledText content.
The following works as expected:
- Scrolling in other views (outline...)
- Scrolling the editor by moving the scrollbar thumb directly
- Scrolling the editor by using the mouse wheel on the scrollbar
- Scrolling the editor using keys (PgDown, Ctrl+Down etc)
