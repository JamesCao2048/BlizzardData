VoiceOver won't read contents of StyledText
VoiceOver won't read the contents of a StyledText box.
-- Run org.eclipse.swt.examples.accessibility.ControlsWithLabelsExample
-- Turn on VoiceOver
-- Mouse over the StyledText
Voiceover says 'blank text' instead of reading the contents of the text box.
(This was noted in my initial checkin but I never wrote a tracking bug.)
