Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Run the attached snippet (modified snippet 151)
2.Scroll completely right
3.Make (for example) column21 larger so that it pushes column22 onwards out of the view
4.The horizontal scroll bar is not updated
More information:
Note that updating the contents of the table forces the scroll bar to be correct.
Also clicking on the scrollbar causes it to correctly reconfigure itself.
