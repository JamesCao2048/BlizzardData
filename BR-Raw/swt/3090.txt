Javadoc of Display.addFilter could be improved
I20050118
The Javadoc of Display.addFilter doesn't tell anything about filtering, it only
says that the added listener will be notified. As far as I understood it no
event is filtered ever but the listener could set doit.false and hope that all
other listeners check that flag.
