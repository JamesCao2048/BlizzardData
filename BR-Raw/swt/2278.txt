Macintosh only: values in some text fields of launch configuration dialog are slightly shifted, obscuring first character
On my Mac (OSX 10.4.7), when I bring up the launch configuration dialog via Run>Run...
or Run>Debug..., some text fields initially show up with the value in the text field shifted just a tiny bit so that all or part of the first character in that text field is hidden.
When you click in the text field, the contents immediately shift so that the entire text is visible.
Although the following repro steps involve the JDT, the actual bug is not in the JDT
-- it is somewhere else.
Perhaps the Eclipse core, or perhaps SWT or JFace, I don't know.
Repro steps:
1.Run any plain Java project, e.g.
a hello-world app or whatever.
This will have the side effect of creating a launch configuration for that project, and making it the "default" launch config (the first one that will be shown next time you bring up the launch config dialog).
2.Bring up the launch config dialog, via Run>Debug...
or Run>Run...
Results: Notice that in the "Name:" field at the top of the dialog, the name of the launch configuration is shifted just a bit, so that all or part of the first character is hidden.
Also, same thing in the "Project:" and "Main class:" fields in the Main tab.
This bug only seems to reproduce when the dialog first appears.
If you click over to any other launch config, or to any other tab of the current launch config, then the problem fixes itself.
