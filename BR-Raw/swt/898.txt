[OLE] Cannot create in-place editor for Microsoft Word documents in Windows Vista
Attempting to open a .doc file results in the following error dialog:
Cannot create the in-place editor
Reason: this is probably because there is no OLE editor registered against the type of file you were trying to open
Details: failed to create OLE client.
result =
-2147024891
This appears to only happen in Windows Vista and only for Word documents (ppt and xls opened fine).
