To input Japanese character in Java editor causes dot garbages ONLY at first.
Build ID: I20070503-1400
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Create a new java Project.
2.Create a new java class(Fig.1).
3.Insert Javadoc comment by entering /** and enter key(Fig.2).
4.Enter some Japanese word using KOTOERI, which is a default Mac OSX Japanes IME, into the java file(Fig.3).
5. Then eclipse cause strange behaviour. Line feed does not work properly, which means line feed left dot garbages(Fig.4). However I cannot reproduce such garbage after  this phenomenon unless I do not close this file. This phenonmenon will occur only at first of opening or creating a new file, I guess.
