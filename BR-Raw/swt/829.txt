Repaint cheese with RTL scrollable in bottom left corner
HEAD
The workaround for  bug 28132  does not seem to work for right-to-left widgets.
To reproduce in the ControlExample, go to the Text widget and then change it to RTL (by pressing Ctrl+Right_Shift or selecting SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT).
Bug is probably that the code in Scrollable#wmNCPaint(int, int, int) that computes the cornerRect is hardcoded to have the corner at windowRect.right.
