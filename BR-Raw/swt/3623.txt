CCombo shouldn't fire defaultSelection on mouse list selection
If you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using
the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection. It shouldn't do this. It should
fire a selection instead.
Default selection means something was selected and you should go and do
something. The typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog.
A combo shouldn't fire default selection from just selecting an entry in the
dropdown. A typical user of a combobox would be vert surprised to have the
dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected. Standard Combos won't
do this.
Because of this you can't tell the difference between just selecting an entry
using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo. Hitting
enter from the text field should be treated as default selection.
