View presentation visual problems
200403240800, Linux, using square tabs, notice 3 problems in attached screen shot:
1. Status text and toolbar should be sharing the same line.
2. Tabs need more space to the right and left of the text. Notice the optical
illusion caused by black text being too close to the line: It looks like the
center of the vertical line is faded or broken
3. Space to left of text has more space than to right of text.
