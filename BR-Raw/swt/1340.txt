block selection, getSelectionText and getSelectionTextCount should be aware of block selection
getSelectionText and getSelectionTextCount should be aware of block selection.
getSelectionText() should always return the same text a copy/cut operation set in the clipboard.
getSelectionTextCount() returns getSelectionText().length.
NOTE: in block selection , getSelectionRange().y can be different from getSelectionTextCount().
the only diferrence being that clibboard text uses system line demiliters while the text returned by getSelectionText uses model line demiliters.
