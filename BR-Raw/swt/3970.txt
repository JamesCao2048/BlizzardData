Incorrect height of widget in TextViewer
In a plugin I use TextViewers with style SWT.SINGLE | SWT.BORDER. The
TextViewers are embedded in composites that have a layout. However they are
always rendered with a height that is insufficient to show the complete string
text inside their widget, with the result that the text is partially chopped
off and unreadable. Resizing of the window that contains the TextViewers does
not have any effect. Of course the height can be adjusted by using a GridLayout
in the enclosing composite and by defining a heightHint, but I believe the
default height should allow to fully see the text in the TextViewer widget.
The problem appears when running under Linux RedHat 7.3 with Eclipse R2.0-gtk2.
The same code runs ok on a Windows 2000 machine, with Eclipse R2.0.
I am separately attaching a little plugin project that demonstrates the
problem. The plugin is a stripped down version of your Sample Plugin with a
View, where I have placed two components in the sample view, the first one
being a TextViewer and the second one a simple text. Under Windows 2000 all is
well, but under Linux the TextViewer's height is insufficient. To run the test,
simply import the plugin, compile it, run as Runtime Workbench and open the
Sample View (under the Sample Category category).
Thanks.
