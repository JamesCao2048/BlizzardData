Inconsistency in layout handling during shell.setVisible
build I20031216
On Windows and other platforms, shell.setVisible(true) forces a layout, but on
the Mac it does not.  This led to a case where there was a layout bug on the
Mac but not on the other platforms.  Although there were other problems in our
code having to do with creating some controls after setting the shell size, it
would be good if the behaviour was consistent on all platforms.
