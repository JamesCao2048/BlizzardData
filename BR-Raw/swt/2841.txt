Table not shown when there are no rows initially
I am using eclipse 3.1m7 on several platforms (linux, windows and aix) and it
only has this problem when I run on AIX ( AIX 5.1, with Motif, java 1.4.2).
The
problem was not there on 3.1m6 or 3.0.1
If I start running with no TableItems, the table does not show the column header
text (even though they were set to be visible.
Also, later when TableItems are
added, they do not show up in the table.

I have a work-around by making sure that at least 1 TableItem exists, Even if
the text in the cells are just empty Strings)
