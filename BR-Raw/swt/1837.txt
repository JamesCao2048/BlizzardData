[CCombo] Using CCombo breaks default button behaviour in RCP view
I have an RCP application.  In one of my views I had a Text control with a Button next to it and a Table under them.  I set the button up as the default button for the view's top composite' shell - using code like this:
myTopComposite.getShell ().setDefaultButton (myRetrieveButton);
This worked as I expected.  After typing in the text box pressing the <enter> key caused the button's selection listener to recieve the widgetSelected event.
Then I changed to a CCombo instead of the Text control.  The default button is still being set the same way but now after typeing (or selecting a prepopulated selectin) pressing the <enter> key has no effect.  If I use the mouse or <tab> key to put the focus on the table and pres the <enter> key things behave as I expected.
I tried Combo (instead of CCombo) and that worked fine too.  There seems to be something about the CCombo that is preventing the default button from getting the widgetSelected event when I press <enter>.
