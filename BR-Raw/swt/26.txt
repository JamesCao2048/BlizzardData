Resource leak in swt Text control
Creating an editable Text field, setting it afterwards to not editable (setEditable(false)) and then disposing the Text field results in a resource leak.
This behaviour can easily be recognised also in the source code of the Text widget.
If at creation the Text field is editable, the call to imContext() in the register() function will return a valid handle, which is then added to the widget array in the display.
If afterwards (before disposing the Text widget) the text field is set to not editable, the call to imContext in the deregister() function will return a 0 value, resulting in a resource leak.
This behaviour has been seen in eclipse 3.5.2 and 3.8.1.
