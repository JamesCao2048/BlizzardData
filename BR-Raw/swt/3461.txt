StyledText doesn't specify contents of its SelectionEvents
StyledText offers to send out SelectionEvents, but I found no specification
about the contents of the SelectionEvent. SelectionEvent says that x and y
fields are Widget-specific, but doesn't link to StyledText.
StyledText#addSelectionListener(..) also doesn't specify the contents of the
SelectionEvent.
Looking at the implementation, I found that StyledText#sendSelectionEvent()
fills the Event.x and Event.y fields from the field StyledText#selection. At the
definition of this field, I found a wrong line comment, which reads...
Point selection = new Point(0, 0);  // x is character offset, y is length
But when I look at the rest of the class, it seems as if
- x is the start character offset
- y is the offset of the next character after the selection (and NOT the length)
Therefore, I suggest:
- completing the Javadoc of StyledText#addSelectionListener()
- correcting the erroneous comment of field StyledText#selection
