Table Header stays depressed.
Create an SWT application with a Table and a push Button, the Table must have a
column header.
1. Make the push Button receive keyboard focus.  This can be achieved by
pressing the mouse button inside of the push Button, dragging it outside of the
push Button and then releasing the mouse button.
2. Press the mouse button over the Table header.  Do not release the mouse
button.
3. Press and hold the space bar.  This will cause the push Button to depress.
4. Move the mouse outside of the Table header and release the mouse button.
This causes the Table header to remain depressed.
5. Release the space bar.
This is repeatable for the headers of all the Table's Columns.
