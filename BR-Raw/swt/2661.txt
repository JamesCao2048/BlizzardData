Moveable table column and DND feedback clash on MacOS X
If you create a table and set the columns to be moveable all works fine and you
get the little "grab hand" icon on OSX when you move the column (use snippet 181
for testing, located at:
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet181.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup )
If you now add a drag / drop listener to the table as...
DropTarget dropTarget = new DropTarget(table, DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_COPY);
DragSource dragSource = new DragSource(table, DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_COPY);
.. and try to reorder columns, you now get an arrow icon with a little stop icon
next to it. It still works actually reordering the columns, but the "feedback"
while you're doing it is wrong.
(This all works fine on Windows XP).
