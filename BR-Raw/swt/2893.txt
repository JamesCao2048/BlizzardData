Close override redirect while opening another loses focus forever
I200408241200, GTK+ 2.4.4, KDE 3.2.3, Linux 2.6.7

I tried binding "Open editor drop-down" to "Ctrl+X B".  If you then press,
"Ctrl+X" and wait, a key assist dialog opens.  This dialog is an override
redirect window.  Now, if you press "B", it will close the key assist dialog
and open the editor drop-down.  The editor drop-down is also an override
redirect shell.

Focus disappears.  The second override direct shell never closes.  You can
click around, but I haven't managed to find a way to motivate keyboard focus to
come back again.
