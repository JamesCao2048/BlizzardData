overlap image transparency failure in 16bits color quality
Build ID: 3.2.2
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Open the Display's properties from Control Panel of Window XP; and confirm the Color quality is 32bits.
2.Copy the overlap.png to c:, then run the snippet code from Eclipse PDE;
3.A window is open, and you will see the green circle block is shown on window.
This is expect result as the code.
4.Open the Display's properties from Control Panel again, and change the Color quality to 16bits, then apply this change.
5.You will see the red rectangle block is shown overlap below the green circle.
this is a wrong result.
Actually, the Red rectangle block is the transparent background pixels overlap the green circle image.
It should not shown as background either 16bits or 32 bits color quality.
Code snippet is attached below.
