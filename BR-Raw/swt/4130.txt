Revert is much slower than close and re-open in java editor.
1) Start by opening an editor on the file
org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.java from the source folder "Eclipse SWT
Custom Widgets" in the project "org.eclipse.swt" in the open source repository.
2) Now, select the end of the first line, and hit a space character so that
the file has been marked dirty.
From this point, on my (fast) machine at home, it takes about 8 seconds to
perform the following steps:
- click on the close box in the editor tab.
- answer "no" to the "do you want to save changes" dialog
- double click on the file in the navigator to re-open it.
However, if I repeat steps 1) and 2), and then select "Revert" from the pop up
menu in the editor it takes > 15 seconds to replace the contents of the window
with the original. This seems odd, since reverting the file contents ought not
to be more than closing and re-opening the file.
