drag drop threshold region not calculated properly
The Windows implementation of SWT does not correctly identify the threshold
region (i.e., the area surrounding the mouse cursor outside of which movement
should be regarded as the initiation of a drag and drop operation). This is
because the threshold detection code expects screen coordinates while the
mouse event uses client coordinates. It can be fixed by adding the following
line to org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Control.java:3397. (I've tested this and it
works for me.)
OS.ClientToScreen(handle, pt);
