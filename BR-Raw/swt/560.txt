StyledText.RTFWriter ignores font style
Eclipse 3.6 RC2
I'm trying to use StyledText to create a simple Rich Text editor.
In order to extract RTF from it, I'm using the clipboard workaround.
I'm running into an issue when the style of the text is defined in the font (as opposed to fontStyle).
It seems RTFWriter only writes styles if they are in fontStyle but ignores the ones in FontData.getStyle()
I wonder if this is a bug or I am missing something.
