Display#update does not work on Windows XP
(Creating this bug report to track your progress on this issue.)
This is the problem we talked about - it seems that Display#update does not
paint under certain circumstances. As Steve said, Windows might think we are
dead when we don't spin the event loop for some amount of time.
For the record, I want to show progress while the Workbench is being restored.
This is before we actually run the event loop. The event loop cannot be run
because the Workbench is not in a good state and because the restoring of the
Workbench takes place in the UI thread. We would like to have the progress
dialog repaint though...
