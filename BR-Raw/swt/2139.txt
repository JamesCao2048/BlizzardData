custom drawn Table with SWT.Virtual items performs to much paint-events
Build ID: M20060911-0945
Steps To Reproduce:
custom drawn Table with SWT.Virtual items performs to much paint-events
NOTE: TESTED ONLY ON WIN32 PLATTFORM
1.Create display
- shell
- and a Table widget with SWT.VIRTUAL style
1.1 add 2 columns and some items to the table
2.add listeners for customdrawing:
table.addListener(SWT.EraseItem, ...
implement the drawing of an alternative background color
table.addListener(SWT.PaintItem, ...
implement the drawing of an alternative foreground output that differs from default-drawing
3.output the paint-events to console
- print index and cell content
1.bug :
when you move with your mouse over the table-widget a paint-event is signaled but curiosly no erase-event.
All paint events here are dispensable.
The effect is, that the first cell of the first column becomes repainted but not erased
-> flicker.
Note: this happens only if the table has been created with the SWT.VIRTUAL style.
2.bug :
when you are changing the selection of the table the whole table content will be drawn.
this needs a long time.
Normally only the selected and unselected items should be repainted.
