[browser] Download.java uses wrong pointer
From Javier Pedemonte:
I think there is a bug in the Init() method of Eclipse SWT
Browser/mozilla/org/eclipse/swt/browser/Download.java.
I'm not too
familiar with this code, so I decided to send you a note rather than
open a bug.
Here is the code in question:
nsILocalFile target = new nsILocalFile(aTarget);
int aNativeTarget = XPCOM.nsEmbedCString_new();
target.GetNativeLeafName(aNativeTarget);
length = XPCOM.nsEmbedCString_Length(aSpec);
buffer = XPCOM.nsEmbedCString_get(aSpec);
dest = new byte[length];
XPCOM.memmove(dest, buffer, length);
XPCOM.nsEmbedCString_delete(aNativeTarget);
String file = new String(dest);
I think the two instances of |aSpec| here should instead be |aNativeTarget|.
