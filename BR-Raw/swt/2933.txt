Tree,setTopItem can end up setting the wrong number
The folloing code in setTopItem can result in negative values:
<snip>
int visibleItemCount = (clientArea.height
- getHeaderHeight ()) / itemHeight;
int index = Math.min (item.availableIndex, availableItemsCount
- visibleItemCount);
if (topIndex == index) return;
update ();
int change = topIndex
- index;
topIndex = index;
getVerticalBar ().setSelection (topIndex);
What is happpening on QNX is the following.
I am trying to add the entry to a
tree.
It comes in and it says that the visibleItemsCount is 5 and the
availableItemsCount is 1, this results in a value of
-4 which is less than
item.availableIndex ( which is 1 ).
Further on down the line, change gets set
to 4 because topIndex is 0 and index is
-4. This is a problem because later on
gc.copyArea gets called with a deltaY of 80 when it should be 0.
