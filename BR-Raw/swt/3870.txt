en_US.UTF-8 locale not supported on Motif
Ive noticed that some people had problems with accents in several languages.
Here's a me-too.
I'm using RedHat 8.0 and cannot type accents using dead keys in Eclipse's editor
- nothing happens. Usually with other applications I can type tilde+a and get a
a with tilde (茫). In Eclipse's editor I get the tilde followed by the character
a - it seems that it ignores the dead-key combination.
My keyboard is a Brazilian ABNT-2 so it has a c-cedilla (莽). None of the dead
keys works.
I've tried to set the LANG environment variable to the following values before
running eclipse, without luck:
en_US.UTF-8
en_US
pt_BR.UTF-8
pt_BR
C
I've also tried to unsetenv LANG, no success.
Had the same problem with the downloads
eclipse-SDK-2.0.1-linux-motif.zip
eclipse-SDK-2.0.2-linux-gtk.zip
eclipse-SDK-2.0-linux-gtk.zip
please advise.
thanks
