Background of Control with SWT.INHERIT_FORCE doesn't show through with ToolItems with transparent images
Since 20051212 it is possible to set the background mode of a Control to SWT.INHERIT_FORCE which forces the background for all children.
See:

There seems to be a bug with transparent images on ToolItems, if I didn't miss
something.
The background image doesn't show.
I've attached a variant of Snippet214 and a transparent image.
If you set a background color on the parent Control instead of the background image, everything behaves as expected and the background color shows through the transparent part of the image.
I use WinXP and swt-I20051214.
