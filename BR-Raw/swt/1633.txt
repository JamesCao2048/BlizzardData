[Workbench] TVT33:TCT[Workbench] 159: ar: 13.001120 Tool tips text does not have RTL reading order
OS: Windows
Build date: 05112007
Component Name: CDT
Blocking: No
Tester Name: Noha
Steps to recreate the problem: Create a new workspace. Switch to the C/C++ Perspective: from the main menu go to Window -> Open Perspective -> Other and select C/C++
Problem description:
The tool tips text such as 'New C/C++ Project' does not have RTL reading order, however when I click anywhere else such as clicking on any of the main menus and then go back to the tool tips they become RTL enabled.
As discussed, this is probably a Platform/Base problem.
Thanks!

Hi,
Updating with screen shots.
This is a general problem for all tooltips (including workbench toolbar buttons and view's local toolbar buttons). The switching reading order behavior happens to all strings with Engish mixed in Bidi words. Platform UI please take a look.
