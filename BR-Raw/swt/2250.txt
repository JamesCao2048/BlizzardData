Bad drawing in Tree and Table
This happens in 3.2 and HEAD.
1) Run ControlExample
2) Select Tree or Table tab
3) select SWT.MULTI radio button
First problem, the tree/table is gray instead of white
4) Ctrl+select items 0, 1, 2, 1 (again) in that order, note that item draws badly (no string).
The Tree also draws badly if you expand after selecting.
