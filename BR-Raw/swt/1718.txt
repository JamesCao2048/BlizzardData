TextLayout#getBounds() should return minimal bounds also if width was set
I20080129-1400
TextLayout#getBounds() should return minimal bounds also if setWidth(int) has been called with a non-default argument.
If the width is set to SWT.DEFAULT, clients can use getBounds() to find out how wide and how high the text would be rendered.
This fails in the other case, since getBounds() then always answers the user-supplied width, rather than the real necessary width.
This makes a big difference for texts that don't need to be wrapped.
An inefficient workaround for clients is to use getBounds(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE).
