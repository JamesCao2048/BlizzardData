Clicking the CTabFolder chevron twice does not make the drop down go away
I20040420
When enough tabs are displayed for a chevron to appear, clicking the chevron
once displays a drop down list of open files.
Clicking on the chevron again
once the drop down is open does not make it disappear, instead it closes then
pops back up again.
