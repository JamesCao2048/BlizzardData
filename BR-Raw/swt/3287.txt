[browser] browser crashes on jdk 1.5 beta applets
The SWT Browser (using the sample plugin) seems to crash with
EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION using every Applet demo listed here:
http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.5.0/demos/plugin/applets.html
Namely, the Clock example, Simple Spreadsheet, Simple Bar Chart, and
GraphLayout.
