Sample project to show the problem.
This is a self-contained plug-in to reproduce a problem we have observed on our RCP application for SunOS 5.10, RHEL4, and RHEl5. This plug-in was tested on RHEL5 on gtk2-2.10.4-20.el5 (according to rpm -q gtk2).
1. Import the plug-in into your workspace.
2. Launch the second Eclipse.
3. Window > Show View > Other... > Sample Category > Sample View
4. Context menu on 'A', see item, separator, item.
5. Context menu on 'A2', see only one item.
6. Context menu on 'A', CommandOne.
7. The 'Navigator' view is shown and activated.
8. Keep the mouse in the 'Sample View' and bring up the context menu on 'A'. Take note that you should not Alt+Tab around to other applications.
9. Context menu on 'A', see only one item. The contributed handler through the plugin.xml is not present.
10. Try both left-clicking and right-clicking the different items in the table, 'A' always only shows one item. Notice that the view's tab item is not blue. The blue outline is actually still on the 'Navigator' view.
11. Select the view to activate it, granting it the blue outline.
12. Context menu on 'A', see item, separator, item once again.
Naturally, if the 'Navigator' view is on the same view stack as the 'Sample View', you would be unable to reproduce this problem.
