GDI leak in Label with transparent images (png, gif)
On win32 (windows xp), Label widget in org.eclipse.swt leaks one GDI object each
time a transparent image is set with setImage.
Cause :
in _setImage the image is set with
OS.SendMessage (handle, OS.STM_SETIMAGE, fImageType, hImage);
this message returns the old image handle and CREATES A NEW IMAGE IF hImage has
pixels with alpha != 0
( see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/staticcontrols/staticcontrolreference/staticcontrolmessages/stm_setimage.asp
)
The next time an image is set on the same label, the old (hidden) image is not
disposed and hence GDI leak.
Possible solution :
Before calling _setImage, keep the oldImage :
public void setImage (Image image) {
checkWidget ();
if ((style & SWT.SEPARATOR) != 0) return;
if (image != null && image.isDisposed()) error(SWT.ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT);
// LIKE THIS

oldImage = this.image;
_setImage (this.image = image);
}
When sending OS.STM_SETIMAGE, keep the old handle and if it's different from
handle of the oldImage, delete it
int hOldImage = OS.SendMessage (handle, OS.STM_SETIMAGE, fImageType, hImage);
// LIKE THIS

// The old image handle could have been a transparent one, created by the
STM_SETIMAGE
if (hOldImage != 0)
if (
oldImage != null &&
oldImage.handle != 0 &&
oldImage.handle != hOldImage
){
// We have an image that has been created by a STM_SETIMAGE

OS.DeleteObject(hOldImage);
}


/*
* When STM_SETIMAGE encounters a bitmap with alpha information,
* it takes a copy of the bitmap.
Therefore the bitmap that was
* created to preserve transparency can be deleted right away.
*/
if (hasAlpha && hImage != 0) OS.DeleteObject (hImage);
