[open type] Open Type table shows unmotivated ellipsis, disappears on redraw
I20051122-1300
- select text "CharSequence" in a JavaEditor
- press Ctrl+Shift+T
=> An ellipsis (...) is drawn to the right of the first entry in the list.
When I move another window on top of the dialog and then move it away, the ellipsis is not redrawn.
Dirk, do you have an idea what's happening here? If not, please move to SWT.
