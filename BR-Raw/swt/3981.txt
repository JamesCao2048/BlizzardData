Win32 org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo computeSize() is wrong
The call to GetWindowText() is passing a one-too-small length.
It should include
the space for the terminator (as per observation & MSDN)
int length = OS.GetWindowTextLength (handle);
int cp = getCodePage ();
TCHAR buffer = new TCHAR (cp, length + 1);
>>	OS.GetWindowText (handle, buffer, length);
OS.DrawText (hDC, buffer, length, rect, flags);
width = Math.max (width, rect.right
- rect.left);
should be:
>>	OS.GetWindowText (handle, buffer, length + 1);
