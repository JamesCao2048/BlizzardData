"Next Word" definition
The new "camelCaseAware" definition of a word is great, but I think it is
missing two obvious behaviors.

1) IF_I_HAVE_A_CONSTANT, it should be recognize _ as a word separator.
2) If I have a parameterList(alpha,beta,gamma), it should recognize the comma
between words as separator.
