[Program] org.eclipse.swt.program.Program.launch() will add prefix "file://" before fileName
Build Identifier: M20090917-0800
We have a application on Mac which handles urls like "notes://...", Program.launch("notes://...") used to open this application for us. But it stops work after we upgrade to SWT 3.5.1. We found in 3.5.1, Program.launch will add a prefix "file://" before "notes://" and fails when trying to open "file://notes://..."
Seems it is  a regression caused by  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=259929 .
Reproducible: Always
