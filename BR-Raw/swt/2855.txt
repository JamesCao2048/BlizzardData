[doc] Display.asyncExec example needs to check for isDisposed
The example cited in the online SWT documentation should add a test:
// do time-intensive computations
...
// now update the UI.
We don't depend on the result,
// so use async.
display.asyncExec (new Runnable () {
public void run () {
if (myWindow.isDisposed())  // check if still around
return;
myWindow.redraw ();
}
});
// now do more computations
In some products, I've noticed .log files littered with exceptions because the
asyncExec is processed after the window has already closed.
It wouldn't be a
bad idea to integrate this check into the SWT API, e.g.:
myWindow.asyncUpdate(new Runnable...);
This in turn would check if the widget still exists before executing the
runnable.
