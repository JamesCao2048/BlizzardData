Confirm dialog doesn't work in the embedded Mozilla browser widget
Eclipse 3.0 RC3, mozilla-1.4-3.0.18
Confirm dialog doesn't work in the embedded Mozilla browser widget (work in the
external Mozilla browser).
Here's a testcase:
<html>

<body>
This is a test.

</body>
</html>
<script language="javascript">
if (confirm("This is a confirm dialog"))
alert('You clicked OK');
else
alert('You clicked Cancel');
</script>
In the external Mozilla browser, the confirm dialog and the alert dialog show
up correctly.
However, in the embedded Mozilla browser, the confirm dialog
doesn't show up at all.
Studio v6's Web services tooling, more specifically, the Web Services Explorer
is depended on this fix for the Eclipse 3.0 timeframe.
