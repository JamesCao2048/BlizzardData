Omit use of deprecated GTK_ACCEL_LABEL_SET_ACCEL_STRING and GTK_ACCEL_LABEL_GET_ACCEL_STRING
When compiling with GSEAL_ENABLE flag, there are 2 warnings regarding GtkAccellabel that has no member accel_string.
Please take a look at this patch:
http://fedorapeople.org/cgit/aspektor/public_git/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?h=gtk_accel_string
I am not 100% sure that this is the exact way how it should be, but  it works.
Why I have removed:
int /*long*/ oldPtr = OS.GTK_ACCEL_LABEL_GET_ACCEL_STRING (label);
I have noticed that when I added function:
OS.gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget (label, handle);
instead of deprecated constant, "oldPtr" started producing memory leaks when I run ControlExample and also when I was running this test program:
http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0280__SWT/SetAcceleratorforMenuItem.htm
When I have removed it, issues disappeared.
If you still think this line should be there please let me know.
Also, I have   tried replicating GTK_ACCEL_LABEL_GET_ACCEL_STRING with different functions from GtkAccelLabel and GtkLabel but without any success.
