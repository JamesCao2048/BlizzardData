SWT Link Widget throws Array Out of Bounds Exception
Using Eclipse 3.1m5a creating a Link Widget and setting the text property to a
string less than 4 characters causes an Array Out of Bounds Exception.
This is
because in the parse(String s) method called by setText(String s) there is a
divide by 4 without first checking to see if the string is at least 4 characters
long.
The JavaDocs are not overly clear on the intention of a Link Widget, but it
would seem that any string (including one without any anchored links) is allowed
to be set as the text.
Therefore the setText method should allow 1-3 letter
strings (i.e.
foo).
