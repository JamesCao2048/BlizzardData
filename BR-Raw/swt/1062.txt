[expressions] Edit watch expression action is never enabled
Using I20090224-0800, also happens when self-hosting with latest debug code.
The Edit watch expression action, available in the context menu of the expressions view, is always disabled for me.  I created multiple watch expressions and tried different ways of selecting (clicking, ctrl-a, ctrl-click).
