Cocoa - Font metrics
We are using 3.5M6 x64.
We have a SWT terminal emulator that uses a Courier New Font.
We are
using GC.getAdvanceWidth('W') to figure out how much space each
character takes up and GC.getFontMetrics().getHeight() to figure out
how high each character is.
This works fine in GTK,Windows and Carbon.
With the Cocoa port it
looks like for a 12 point font the width is 2 pixels too small and the
height is 4 pixels too small.
