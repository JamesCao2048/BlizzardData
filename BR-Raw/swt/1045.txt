BlockSelection: setBlockSelectionRectangle should not clamp selection width to renderer width if client area allows a larger selection
HEAD of 20090420:
The fix for  bug 253056  works fine; I found the following problem, however:
setBlockSelectionRectangle clamps the selection location to the renderer width; this is normally wanted, but not if the client area allows for a larger selection.
Consider the following fragment in a text editor, with the brackets marking the selection.
11111111
22222[222  ]
33333[333  ]
44444444
This selection cannot be set via API, since the renderer width is only 8 characters wide.
However, the same selection can be set using keyboard interaction.
The same works if the file has the following contents, since the last line extends the renderer width:
11111111
22222[222  ]
33333[333  ]
44444444
