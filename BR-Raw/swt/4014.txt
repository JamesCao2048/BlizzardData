ScrolledComposite with LayoutManager is VERY slow in iPAQ
I've tried the examples for the ScrolledComposite from
the javadoc on the iPAQ an it is very slow. After touching
the slider it took 2 sec to move the slider to the new position
and another 6 sec to scroll the content of the widget.
I've tried the old examples (displaying 10 buttons) and the
new one (two ScrolledComposite and one button to add buttons
to these widgets).
Then I modified the old examples (deleting the LayoutManager)
and placed the buttons by myself (setLocation). This helps.
Now I can move the slider while the content is repainted.
Seems that the LayoutManager is too slow for the iPAQ.
I'm using:
iPAQ with pocketPC2002
swt-win32-2040.dll
j9
You can find the examples in the old and the new javadoc of
ScrolledComposite.
