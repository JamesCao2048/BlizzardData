Specific file name filter not working on Mac OS X
Build Identifier:
Setting the file filter to a specific file name in the FileDialog doesn't allow selecting the file. For example, having a file named "test.txt" and setting the filter to "test.txt". On Windows or Linux you can select the file, but on Mac OS X the file dialog doesn't allow you to select it. Example code:
import org.eclipse.swt.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;
public class TestFileDialog {
public static void main (String [] args) {
Display display = new Display ();
Shell shell = new Shell (display);
shell.open ();
FileDialog dialog = new FileDialog (shell, SWT.OPEN);
dialog.setFilterExtensions (new String [] {"test.txt"});
dialog.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed ()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();
}
display.dispose ();
}
}
Reproducible: Always
