DBCS: Can type into read-only Text
RC1
- Window -> Preferences
- Workbench - Fonts page
- click in bottom "Description" Text area
- type typical english text: nothing is shown, good
- type a 2- or 4-byte chinese character: it's shown, bad
I can't get a stand-alone example to do this, so perhaps this specific Text has
some obscure set of style bits that is allowing this to happen.
