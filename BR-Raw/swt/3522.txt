[KeyBindings] dialog keyboard shortcuts gone
3.0M4/linux-gtk/j2sdk1.4.2.  I start eclipse with:
-----
ECLIPSE_DIR=/usr/local/eclipse-SDK-3.0M4

exec $ECLIPSE_DIR/eclipse -data $HOME/.eclipse-3.0M4 -vm
/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.2/jre/bin/java

Resize.  Go directly into the preferences dialog.  Scroll down to Java with arrow keys,
hit space bar, scroll down to code generation.  Hit Alt-E.  Nothing.  On further
experimentation, all preferences keyboard shortcuts appear broken.  In Code
Generation/Comments I continued to try using keyboard shortcuts, and at one point
they all happened at once: I got three editors in a row corresponding to the three times
(don't learn fast :) I pressed Alt-E.  Mostly however there was no apparent result to
hitting the keyboard shortcut.
