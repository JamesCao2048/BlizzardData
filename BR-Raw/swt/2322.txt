GTK FileDialog ignores setFileName() for SWT.OPEN dialogs if no filterPath set
The GTK version of FileDialog only honors setFileName() if setFilterPath() is
also called before open(), apparently because presetChooserDialog() has its call
to OS.gtk_file_chooser_set_filename() wrapped in an "if (filterPath.length () >
0)".  However, presetClassicDialog() appears to do the right thing.  Is there
some issue with the new GTK file chooser where giving it only a relative
filename won't work?  If so, can the current working directory be used as a
default filterPath?
