Perf Fix for: org.eclipse.swt.internal.image.PngHuffmanTable.generateTable
org.eclipse.swt.internal.image.PngHuffmanTable.generateTable has a bubble sort of the Huffman table in the top of the routine.
Profiling an application opening a  window with a moderate number of PNG images (around a dozen) shows this method to be accounting for 43% of the the instructions executed in the open window scenario.
Changing the code to sort via java.util.Arrays.sort()  results in reducing the instruction counts for this method to less than 5% of the scenario total.
(email me if you want the chaged code) For the specfic scenario I'm looking at (window w/ about a dozen PNGs) the improved code is noticeably (to an end user) quicker.
