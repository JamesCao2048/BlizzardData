setEditable() method for Combo or CCombo
At present it is not possible to change a Combo or CCombo from being editable to
non-editable or vica-versa once it has been created. This can only be set when
the Combo/CCombo is created by using the SWT.READ_ONLY constant.
I have an application where I would like to change the editability of a CCombo
depending on the selection in other widgets. It seems that I will have to create
a new CCombo each time and copy the content across. It would be much more
convenient to have a setEditable() method.
