'Free' TableViewer column cannot be edited
When a TableViewer instance is created, one column is created for free if none
is specified. This works well and handles the resizing of the table, but the
code in 'activateCellEditor' ignores it when there are no explicitly created
columns.
Please give me a heads up when the fix is released so that I can test my code
before the integration build. Otherwise, all PDE editors will be broken (cannot
rename entries in lists).
