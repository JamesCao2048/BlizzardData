ToolBar only needs to resize its children if the bounds are required
ToolBar currently calls forceResize() in layoutItems().
This is required to
ensure that items with controls can update their position.
This call is
expensive, and so deferring it until someone requires the bounds is a
performance improvement.
A similar strategy to the one used for getClientArea()
of TabFolder and Group can be used.
