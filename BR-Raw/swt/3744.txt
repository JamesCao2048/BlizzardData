Can't select styles in combo example
RC2
Linux-GTK
1. Launch the ControlExample and go to the Combo tab.
2. With SWT.SIMPLE selected, try to select SWT.READ_ONLY or SWT.BORDER.
3. The checkboxes appear enabled but clicking in them only causes them to
flash.
4. Select SWT.DROP_DOWN and repeat step 2.
5. Now SWT.READ_ONLY can be selected, but SWT.BORDER still cannot.
The checkboxes should appear disabled when they're not applicable. Also, if
the SWT.BORDER style is never usable it probably shouldn't appear in the tab?
