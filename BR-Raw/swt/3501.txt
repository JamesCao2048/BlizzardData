unexpected behavior for TableItem.setBackground() when column is not left-aligned
When a table column is not left-aligned(i.e. SWT.CENTER or SWT.RIGHT is used),
calling TableItem.setBackground() will only set the background color of each
cell from where the text starts to the end of the cell, not the entire cell.
So when you select a row, instead of the whole row being colored the same
continuously from left to right, you have all these white spaces on the left of
each cell.
