[Widgets] Problems with repeating events of Spinner widgets on Linux/GTK
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090707 Iceweasel/3.5 (Debian-3.5-1) GTB5

When the buttons on a spinner with digits are a selecting the spinner jumps quickly to its maximum or minimal values on Linux using GTK version.
For Snipped190, it happens only if the increment is below 10.E.g., "spinner.setIncrement(1)" instead of
"spinner.setIncrement(10)".
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click the "up" button in the Snippet190 (with spinner.setIncrement(1)) and hold it.
2.Same happens with the up arrow of the keyboards.
