SWT Spinner selection value error
I am getting really strange values of Spinner.getSelection(). I set up the spinner in the following way (tested on Snippet190):
spinner.setDigits(1);
spinner.setMinimum(0);
spinner.setMaximum(10000);
spinner.setIncrement(1);
spinner.setSelection(0);
I get the result of selection 7 two times i.e. for 7th and 8th position (8 is never returned it jumps directly to 9). It gets even more interesting because again I get 9's twice (instead of 9 and 10). Then some numbers are returned correctly. The problem again starts at 47 - the values returned are basically "one step behind" of what they should be. I can't really see any pattern here...
Obviously the actual number (selection / Math.pow(10, digits)) is incorrect as well.
The same behaviour for SWT 3.2 and 3.3M2.
I am using 3.2 Callisto GTK2 under Ubuntu.
