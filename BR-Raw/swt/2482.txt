notifed is not a word
This is really minor, but I frequently see this phrase in SWT doc:
"Adds the listener to the collection of listeners who will be notifed...
"
Where "notifed" should be spelled "notified".
Trivial, but a quick search found 45 references to the non-word "notifed" in the SWT javadoc.
