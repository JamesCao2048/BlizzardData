Ctrl+ Clicking on PackageExplorer expands items
I200405190010, Solaris 8, CDE
Hold down the Ctrl key and try selecting different items in the list in the tree
view.
This seems to be treated as a double-click, which opens one of the
items.
What's worse is that it expands the top-most item in the current
selection that has not already been expanded.
This is sometimes quite distant
from the current selection (e.g., try a "shift" selection and then move
elsewhere and try to add to the selection using "ctrl").
