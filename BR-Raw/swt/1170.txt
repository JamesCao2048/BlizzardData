[logview] hover (tooltip) from error log view doesn't go away
to reproduce:
# display the Error Log view
# select an item that has a stack trace message and hover over it so that the tooltip is visible
# *without moving the mouse* use Command-Tab to select another application (I used Safari) that will appear covering the current mouse location
# move the mouse over the other application so that it is no longer over the screen area where the Error Log view was displayed
# Command-Tab back to Eclipse
# notice that the tooltip is still displayed as you work in different editors and views
# notice that the tooltip will only go away if the Error Log view receives focus again
This is a major usability issue since the tooltip obscures part of the screen and it's difficult to figure out how to make it go away.
