Table right mouse double click registers as left mouse click
Using the following code:
table.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
public void mouseDoubleClick(MouseEvent e) {
}

public void mouseDown(MouseEvent e) {
}
});
The mouseDoubleClick method is called correctly when a double right mouse
click is performed on a Table. However, the given MouseEvent's button always
== 1, even if the left button was not used.
However, when using a single mouse click the mouseDown method is also
correctly called. However, it's MouseEvent's button is assigned correctly to
1,2,3, etc.
To get around this I use a selection listener instead and use the
widgetDefaultSelected to capture left double mouse clicks on a Table.
However, the double click behaviour will not allow a differentiation between
left and right clicks. Is this correct behavior? ie platform specific?
