StyledText - cheese when typing in SWT.SINGLE mode
build 20020806
StyledText.handleTextChanged does not take the top margin into account when
rendering directly.
The double buffer image ends up being too small and the
bottom portion of the first line is not blitted to the screen resulting in
cheese.
