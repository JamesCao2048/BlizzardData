double-click after opening brace does not select all block
Version: 3.3.0
Build id: I20070410-1043
J2RE 5.0 IBM J9 2.3 Windows XP x86-32 build j9vmwi3223-2007020
test scenario:
- open a Java file
- at the beginning of a method, or try block, place the cursor after the opening brace {
- double click
--> only the current line gets selected, whereas I expect the whole block to be selected.
this works OK with an M6 build
