Link does not wrap without vertical fill
3.5 and I20100504-0800
The link widget does not properly wrap on Cocoa. If you open the ControlExample, select Size > Preferred, Horizontal Fill, and then make the window narrow, the Link wraps on WinXP and GTK, but doesn't wrap on Cocoa.
When Vertical Fill is also checked, it also works properly on Cocoa.
This bug can also be seen in the SDK in "Preferences > Java > Editor" and "Preferences > Java > Editor > Syntax Coloring" (links on top don't wrap).
