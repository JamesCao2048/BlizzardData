SWT/Cocoa TreeItem.getBounds() behaviour differently than on other platforms
Build ID: I20090430-2300
Steps To Reproduce:
More information:
On SWT/Cocoa TreeItem.getBounds() returns the bounds of the whole column, as opposed to Win32 or GTK where getBounds() returns the bounds of the item itself.
(we use the win32/gtk behaviour in order to track clicks in the item's icon)
