[CTabFolder] does not gain focus
I have a CTabFolder which has a few CTabItems.
Each CTabItem has a few widget
controls (for example, texts and combos).
If one of the widgets has the focus,
then the tab can not gain focus by clicking on the title of the tab using
mouse.
However, the tab can get focus if I use TAB key to tab through.
I do not see this problem with org.eclipse.swt.widgets.TabFolder.
