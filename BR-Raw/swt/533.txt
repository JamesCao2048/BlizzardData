Eclipse crashed - once again
Build Identifier: 3.6
I've lost count how many time I have filed a bug like this, and I don't even know if my eclipse crashes always because of the same reason. I know that this is starting to get on my nerves. I see that this is related to Safari and might not be fixable by the swt team. In that case I wonder if there a switch that lets me use FF/gecko instead.
Reproducible: Sometimes
