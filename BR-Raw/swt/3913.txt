GTK: Marking text using the mouse
I found this bug using the M1 and M2 releases of Eclipse for Linux-GTK.
The bug
is not present in the 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 releases.
When selecting text (marked in blue) in an editor using the mouse, and
"dragging" the mouse to select text which is not currently visible (i.e.
single
left clicking at some point in the visible text and then dragging the mouse
below the editor view), Eclipse stops responding.
If I then try to stop Eclipse,
the OS tells me that: 'The Window "Java Browsing
- Eclipse Platform" is not
responding' and I then has to kill Eclipse.
Doing this, Eclipse reports the
following error (and exits):
JVM terminated.
Exit code=1
/coll/local/bin/java
-cp /products/eclipse-2.1-M2/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
-os linux
-ws gtk
-arch x86
-showsplash /products/eclipse-2.1-M2/eclipse
-showsplash 600
-data /home/cnc/eclipseprojects
If I instead selects the text using the keyboard it works fine.
