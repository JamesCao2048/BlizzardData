Cannot use the pull down menu in GTK
2.1 build 20021017
You cannot use the pulldown menu in GTK if you invoke it from Ctrl F10 as it
will not have focus.
STEPS
1) Open the packages view
2) Hit Ctrl F10 to get the pulldown menu
3) Use the arrow keys
- no entry will be selected unless you bring the mouse
over to give it focus
