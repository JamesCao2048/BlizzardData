Logitech Revolution mouse doesn't scroll down editor when in "free-spinning" mode
Build ID: M20060921-0945
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Spend too much on a mouse.
2.Turn scroll acceleration to minimum (or this will somewhat mask the effect)
3.Scrolling down on free-spinning mode only occurs when spun at high speed, where as scrolling up works normally.
4.Spinning very fast in either direction causes strangeness and generally odd behavour with free-spinning scrolling all round.
More information:
Logitech's new mouse has a scrolling mode where the wheel spins smoothly.
This works immediately in most applications but eclipse demonstrates odd behaviour when using the mode.
