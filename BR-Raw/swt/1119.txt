[SWT_AWT] Browser.print(GC) should not use AWT component ancestor clip
Created  attachment 127883   [details]
Browser in AWT where clip does not work.
Build ID: SWT-N20090305-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1. have an AWT component with a clipped region (using JNA for example)
2. browser.print(gc)
3. The hidden areas are rendered black
More information:
If fixPrintWindow is artificially forced to true in Control.printWidget(int, int, GC), then it prints correctly.
Attached is a sample that shows the issue: after 5 seconds a screenshot is taken on a clipped area containing a browser.
You need the JNA JAR file and the JNA examples JAR file, which can be found here:
