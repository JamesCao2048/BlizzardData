[3.7.x] GLCanvas maintenance fix causes NullPointerException when changing parent on Mac
Build Identifier: M20120118-0800
I use GLCanvas in my RCP app and a common workflow is to change the parent window of the widget (often moving a CTabFolder containing the GLCanvas from one partition to another). The app uses Eclipse SDK 3.7.0 and the correct behavior is observed. The workflow causes a NullPointerException when using a recent 3.7.x stream build (e.g. M20120118-0800).
I confirmed that you can successfully change the parent of a GLCanvas in SWT 3.7.0 and 3.7.1. The (soon to be) attached code snippet can be used to reproduce the error by changing the sample project's SWT dependency. I only tested the 32-bit version of SWT; I assume the same holds true for the 64-bit version.
I suspect this defect was introduced with the fix to  Bug 343331 , which was last changed 9/7/2011 (change previous to that in 2009).
I marked this bug CRITICAL as it introduces a crash condition in a maintenance release. I expect the same fix will be required in the 4.2/3.8 branch.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two shells (shell1, shell2)
2. Create a GLCanvas and set shell1 as parent
3. Change GLCanvas parent to shell2
