Need "Full Keyboard Access" in order to traverse into Tree
Version: 4.3.0
Build id: I20120920-1300
I can no longer traverse into a Tree using the keyboard, unless I enable Full Keyboard Access for "All Controls" in the OSX System Preferences.
I should be able to traverse into a Tree even if this setting is set to "Text Boxes and Lists Only".
