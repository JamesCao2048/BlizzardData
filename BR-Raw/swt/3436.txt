Using SWT.RIGHT on a ToolBar leaves blank space
build I20040113
- changed the RCP Browser example to create its ToolBar using SWT.FLAT |
SWT.RIGHT
- the ToolBar has 4 ToolItems: Back (image only), Forward (image only), Stop
(text only) and Refresh (text only)
- when it comes up, the Back and Forward items have a fair bit of blank space
after the arrow images (see attached screen shot)
From scanning MSDN, it seems like this is platform behaviour on Windows, but
it's almost certainly not what an app wants.
I think that many RCP apps will want this style, with tool items having mixed
icons and text, with no extra blank spaces (compare with IE).
