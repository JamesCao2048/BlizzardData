Unable to expand/collapse trees in properties view
Build 20020607
Redhat 7.2, KDE 2.2-10
GTK2
- Import a plugin, such as ..core.boot
- Open the Properties view
- Highlight the plugin so you can see the properties
- Try to collapse the tree by clicking on the '-' box
It doesn't do anything. In fact, it is impossible to expand or collapse any
tree node from the properties view in GTK2 (as far as I can see). To see a tree
with more nodes and levels, follow these steps..
- Install the examples
- Create a file called 'test.usr'
- Open the properties view
- Click on 'richard' in the outline view
You'll see a tree with '+' and '-' boxes visible but nothing happens when you
try to expand/collapse them.
NOTE: You'll also notice that the children of a node aren't indented at all. On
top of this, when you click on a child that doesn't have children (no '+' or '-
'), it sometimes scrolls the view such that the selected field appears at the
top of the view, if your view is small enough vertically. And finally, if you
have properties that you can edit (such as the "test.usr" one) and you shrink
your view vertically enough to show vertical scrollbars, then when you click
on, say, a text field to edit it, the editable box that comes up is on top of
the scrollbar.
McQ: Should I file each of these as individual PRs? Some of these look related.
