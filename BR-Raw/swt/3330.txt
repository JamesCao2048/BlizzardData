Embedded AWT windows use wrong location
The code in SWT_AWT for 3.0M9 was modified slightly to change how the SWT.Move
event was handled as well as how the initial location of the embedded window
was handled.
This causes the window to not be at the 0,0 location within its
parent.
In fact the window moves away from the 0,0 location of its parent as
the whole app is moved away from the 0,0 screen location.
The problem is the
use of anything other than 0,0 in the setLocation and setBounds calls that
were added.
The problem goes away if
frame.setBounds (bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.width, bounds.height);
is changed to:
frame.setBounds (0,0, bounds.width, bounds.height);
and
frame.setLocation (location.x, location.y);
is changed to:
frame.setLocation(0,0);
