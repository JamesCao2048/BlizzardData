CTabFolder - close button doesn't appear when tab moves under mouse
Build GM2
Ensure that your perspective is full of editor tabs, but not so full that
the 'left/right' arrows appear in the tab area of the CTabFolder.
Close the rightmost tab using your mouse.
When you close it, the remaining tabs will expand a bit to fill the full space
at the top.
This means that another tab is now under the cursor.
However the
tab did not detect that it was redrawn under the mouse cursor, so it doesn't
display its close box.
Moving the mouse slightly causes the close box to appear.
