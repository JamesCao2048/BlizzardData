ImageData getPixel operation
The method "int getPixel(int x, int y)" of ImageData has several "if"s in a row,
depending on the depth.  Even if smart (the ones doing image processing) users
should not be using "getPixel" repeateadly, it's a shame that is does not use a
switch statement, which is bound to be mush faster.  Since it is not even an
"if/elsif", and the method starts with one, images of depth 8 or more, which are
very common for digital photography end up iterating over all the depth before
arriving at the desired depth.
