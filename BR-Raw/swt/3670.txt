DBCS: Set text generates Index of Bounds exception using 2.0 NLS language pack
Driver: RC2
Java : Sun Java 1.3.1_07
OS: Solaris
Language: ja_JP
I got errors in the .log file during launching the WB with NLS language
package, and WB did not launch.
Steps
1. Extract the eclipse-SDK.zip
2. Extract the NLS Language package (eclipse-nls-SDK-2.0.x.zip) under the same
directory
3. Launch the eclipse (./eclipse -vm /......)
Then I got the error dialog and got errors in the .log file. WB startup failed.
