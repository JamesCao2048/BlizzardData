Table Headers getting random images on Vista
I20060926 Beta 2
The tasks view is getting random (i.e. they are not even in the ide plug-in) extra images assigned to the table headers.
This is the only one of the marker views that has header images (it is fine in the ones we set explicitly) and it is not an issue in the others.
I will attach a screenshot
