CTabFolder should not select an item unless the first button has been pressed
In CTabFolder's onMouse(Event) handling of the SWT.MouseDown event, there is a fair amount of conditional blocks that prevents things from happening unless the first mouse button is the one that was clicked. This is not in place for tab selection. There are requests against platform to not select a part when the user right-clicks on it ( bug 60833 ) and to close it when it's been middle-clicked ( bug 258511 ). This behaviour can be observed on applications like Firefox and IE7. If I invoke Ctrl+H and bring up the search dialog, I can see that right-clicking and middle-clicking doesn't cause the tabs to switch. Can the same be implemented for CTabFolder?
