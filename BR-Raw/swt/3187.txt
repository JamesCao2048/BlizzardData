DCR - GridLayout should not treat width/height hint as minumum size when grab/fill is specified
The GridLayout manager treats the width and height hint as a minumum width even
if fill and grab is specified for the cell. But is doesn't treat it as a
maximum width. This makes it hard to design dialogs which are opened on
a "smaller" screen. Consider the following example:
- a shell with a tree and some label below the tree
- the layout is managed by a GridLayout manager.
- we specify a width hint of 500 for the tree and make it fill and grab.
Open the dialog. When you resize it (make it larger) the tree gets enlarged as
well. If you make the dialog small the tree get clipped.
When you now open the dialog on a smaller screen (600x480) the tree gets
clipped right from the beginning.
