Default behaviour for FileDialog different on Vista
I'm using Windows Vista with Eclipse 3.3M6 WPF running.
When you try to import a team project set and click the "browse" button to locate the psf file, it shows a "Save As" Dialog.
I dug into the implementation org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.wizards.ImportProjectSetMainPage and discovered that they are using the single-argument constructor for FileDialog, i.e.
new FileDialog(shell).
I modified Snippet72 to use the single-argument constructor and ran the results on Windows XP and Windows Vista.
On XP, I'm presented with an "Open File" dialog.
On Windows Vista, I'm presented with a "Save As" dialog.
The JavaDoc doesn't specify what the behaviour should be, but I imagine that it should be consistent from platform to platform.
This constructor is used around 20 different places in the SDK.
