Regression: Radio buttons fail to redraw background
[Setting "Version" to 3.2 since Bugzilla does not yet offer 3.3]
SWT-win32, v3301 (HEAD), Windows Classic Theme
- Run Snippet 214
- Click on some of the radio buttons
-> The background is not redrawn, resulting in abandoned focus outlines
and text that is getting bolder (ClearType=on)
