SWT TrayItem Image not scaling properly on Mac OSX

Scaling problem of the TrayItem on Mac 10.6.x
On my cross-platform SWT Java application, I'm using TrayItem's setImages() function to set the dock and status bar icon.
The icon is a 128x128 transparent PNG.
The status and tray icons are appropriately clipped on both Windows and Linux distributions, but on the Mac I have problems that make the status bar icon appear with strange padding on both sides like  attachment 1   [details] .
It's strange to me that this is working on all other platforms but the Mac.
For instance, on my Linux and Windows 7 boxes, this does not occur.
I believe the issue lies in widgets/TrayIcon.java in the setImage function.
There the code calls item.setLength to the width of the image + the border.
I believe this is what is causing the extra padding to show up.
This only happens on the Mac because (I think) Windows and Linux automatically crop to a square icon which Mac does not.
