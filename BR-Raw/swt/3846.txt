Cut & paste does not work in dialog text fields
Cut and paste works in the editor, but not in any text field that appears in a
dialog box.
I believe this was working prior to M4, but has not worked since
then.
When hitting one of the shortcuts (Command-C, X, or V) the help(!) menu
flashes, but no cutting or pasting occurs.
