[Mac] Using expos锟 and selecting Eclipse doesn't bring Eclipse window on top.
Build Identifier: 20090920-1017
I'm using MacBook Pro.
OS: Mac Os X  Version 10.5.8
Processor: 2.26 GHz Intel Core Duo
Memory: 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3

When using Expose on MacBook Pro and select the Eclipse window; It doesn't get the Eclipse window on top, but the upper menu (Where Eclipse - File - Edit - Source...) shows.

Notice that you need to select the other applications window before jumping using expos茅. Otherwise it will make you believe that it works normal.
