Cheese on Java Scrapbook page ruler
Bulid F1 on SuSe 7.3
1) Create a new Java Scrapbook page and open it
2) Right-click on scrapbook page editor's ruler
A tiny 3D square shows up on the ruler (it usually appears where the mouse is
but sometimes appears at a completely different place)
Looks like it might be some sort of stray widget...  It disappears when focus
is removed from the ruler.
This doesn't happen on Linux/Motif or Win32.
