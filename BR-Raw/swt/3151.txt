Platform inconsistency: drawLine(X,Y,X,Y) does nothing on the Mac
On Windows and Linux drawLine(X,Y,X,Y) draws a single pixel, but on the Mac
nothing is drawn.
For example, add the following to the paintControl method of HelloWorld5.java
from the SWT examples:
gc.drawLine(100,100,100,100);
I have since discovered there is a drawPoint() method, which does work, but this
is still a bug - drawLine should work the same across the platforms.
