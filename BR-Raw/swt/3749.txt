Disposing a toolbar does not dispose the child controls properly
GEF and others place drop-down combo controls on the Toolbar via a custom
ContributionItem.  At some point in our code we ask the Combo if it is
disposed, and it says no.  Then we try to do something, and it throws widget is
disposed exception.
The Toolbar is getting disposed, but is not disposing its child, the Combo.
