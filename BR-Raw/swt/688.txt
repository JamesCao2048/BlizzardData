[Browser] hook key/mouse event listeners earlier on Safari

patch
The key/mouse event listeners are being hooked in both Cocoa and Carbon in webView:didFinishLoadForFrame: , which seems late, particularly for pages with large images or when using a slow connection.
The attached patch hooks them in webView:didCommitLoadForFrame: , which is likely the earliest that this can be done.
