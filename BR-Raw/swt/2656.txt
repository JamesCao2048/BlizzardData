Mac: Menu Highlight Cheese
A Listener responds to a menu item selection event, which was caused by a keyboard shortcut, by
changing the active Shell (perhaps by using a FileDialog). The menu highlight is not properly cleared.
Thus, when the original Shell is once again made active, the highlight lingers until some other action
clears it. Note that the highlight only lingers when the menu item is activated via keyboard shortcut --
selecting a menu item via mouse click works properly.
This behavior was observed using SWT 3.1 on Mac OS X 10.4.2.
P.S. Perhaps this is a reason why  bug #102293  has not been resolved?
