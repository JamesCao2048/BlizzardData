Virtual table: flashes on clear
The open type dialog has a virtual table with lets say 100 elements. Now I get a
new result set, adjust the item count (lets say to 90) and clear the whole table.
This cases the table to be redrawn which can be recognized as a short flash. To
reproduce:
- take JDT/UI form HEAD
- enable VIRTUAL support in TypeInfoViewer
- start workspace
- load all Eclipse plug-ins as binary
- open the dialog
- type List
- in the text field repeat removeing t and adding t at the end. You see the
table flashing.
Is there anything I can do to avoid this.
