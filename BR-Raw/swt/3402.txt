Can't click in Content Assist window of New Class wizard
Using build I20040406, while creating a new Java class, I used the Content
Assist to choose a superclass (CTRL-Space in superclass field).
When I did so, I
could use the arrow keys to select a superclass but could not select one with
the mouse.
I am running RH 9.0.
