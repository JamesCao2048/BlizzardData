[Browser] Make sure Eclipse works with xulrunner 1.9.1beta
Build ID: n/a
Steps To Reproduce:
Have xulrunner 1.9.1 installed on your Linux system and Eclipse stops to start correctly.
More information:
While searching for a solution for the issue that Eclipse doesn't start anymore on any of my Linux machines I found some informations that Eclipse crashes with xulrunner 1.9.1 because of mozilla's interface changes.
I confirmed that this is also the reason on my system.
The thing is that I still have also xulrunner 1.9.0 available on my system which works when I specify the location to it to eclipse's vm.
Therefore why does Eclipse use the newest xulrunner instead of one which is known to work?
The /etc/gre.d registrations are correct so it should be possible to filter on a specific version.
