Expandbar treats any mouse click as a left click
Build id: I20070208-2030
Steps:
1. Open Control example
2. Choose 'ExpandBar' tab
3. Enable 'Popup Menu'
4. Right click on a title bar, such as "What is your favorite button?"
Notice that the right click is understood and a popup menu appears, but the click is also treated as a left click and causes the bar to expand/collapse. On other platforms (e.g. windows, linux), only left clicking causes the bar to expand/collapse.
