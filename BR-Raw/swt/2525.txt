Native crash in SWT when brower JavaScript closes the window
1) In Windows XP with SWT 3.2 M4 (and also M3), open a Shell that has a Browser widget.
2) In the Browser, run some asynchronous JavaScript to close the window.
Something like the following JavaScript:
setTimeout("window.close();", 5000);
The JVM will core dump with:
