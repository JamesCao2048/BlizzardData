[KeyBindings] accelerators on Mac OS X 'application menu' should not always be active
Command+Q closes eclipse on Mac OS X due to this accelerator being registered on the mac-
specific 'application menu'.
This means you can close eclipse within a dialog, which causes unpredictable results (usually
errors in the log regarding disposing of widgets..)
Command+Q, perhaps all all accelerators in this menu, should be disabled when in dialogs.
A
more complete solution would provide us explicit control over these accelerators for rebinding.
I remember Andre saying that he had a solution for this, and I know that the MRJ toolkit from
apple has some (AWT dependant) API for managing this menu.
