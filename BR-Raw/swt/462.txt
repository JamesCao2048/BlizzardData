SWT Text control with SWT.MULTI style appears incorrectly when disabled
Build Identifier: 3.6 Helios Release
Using Cocoa ws.
The multiline text control appears differently from the single line one, when setEnabled is set to false.
The cocoa multiline text control behaves exactly the same as the single line one, ideally so should the SWT control.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run the SWT controls examples
2.On the SWT Text example tab select SWT.SINGLE and toggle enablement
3.Select SWT.MULTI and toggle enablement
