[DND] Combo/Text on Linux does not fire Drop event.
Environment:
- ON: Suse Linux ED 10.
- Eclipse 3.3 M7 build to
- run the attached SimpleDnDExample.java
It has following problems:
The public void drop(DropTargetEvent event) method in DropTargetListener
instance will not be invoked when drop some strings into Combo, but it can be
invoked correctly on Windows.
The current result is: if you drop some text to combo, it appends text in the current caret position.
