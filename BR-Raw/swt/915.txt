ZIP with the html page and all referenced files
Build ID: M20090211-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
On a HTML-page with javascript (which changes the HTML-document via key listeners) two things go different (reference page with css and javascript in the attached zip)
1.Using the backspace key the char left to the cursor is blanked out, but the position of the cursor leaves unchanged.
2.Pasting text in one of the entry fields with ctrl+v puts the text into the field, but blanks out the first char.
More information:
The newest version of Eclipse (Galileo) also works like Ganymede.
In the Europa version we did not have these problems.
On other pages (not attached) the setting of the focus into the HTML-Page with javascript also does not work properly.
Seems to be a problem with javascript??
