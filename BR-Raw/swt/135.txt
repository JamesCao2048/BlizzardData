Tree and Table tooltips cut second line on Windows

Fix
Tree and Table tooltips cut text after the first line delimiter.
A prominent example of this is the EGit multi-pull result dialog in case the workspace contains pending changes in files that would be updated by the pull.
The patch ensures that tooltips show the complete text. The changes in the Snippets are NOT to be released -- I just used them to verify the fix and left them for the reviewer's convenience.
Note that Table and Tree treat line delimiters differently:
- Table just concatenates all lines and strips the line delimiters.
=> The fix does the same for the tooltips.
- Tree:
- first column: cuts the text after the first line delimiter
- other columns: concatenates all lines and strips delimiter
=> The fix enables multi-line tooltips like it already works for header tooltips. It doesn't fix the different behavior for the first column (that's a separate bug).
Other platforms:
- Mac: items show only the first line, but tooltips show all lines
- GTK: there are no free tooltips, but items are already rendered multi-line
