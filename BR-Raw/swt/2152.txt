infinite loop of repaint events on canvas view in plugin
setting up a view with a canvas, I get a infinite loop of repaint events,
if I set the background color of the canvas in the paint adapter. The problem
does not occur on WinXp.
I created a minimal example plugin, but I dont know how to attach it to the report.
However, the following lines of code in the paint adapter cause the
problem:
public class PaintAdapter implements PaintListener {
private Canvas canvas;
public PaintAdapter(Canvas canvas) {
this.canvas = canvas;
}
public void paintControl(PaintEvent e) {
System.out.println("redraw according to event"+e);
GC gc = e.gc;
Display display = e.display;
Color bgColor = display.getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_WHITE);
Color fgColor = display.getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_DARK_RED);
// this causes the trouble creating infinite number of
// repaint events
canvas.setBackground(bgColor);

gc.setForeground(fgColor);
gc.drawOval(100, 100, 100, 50);
}
}
