ImageLoader.save(filename, format) should close the OutputStream.
It appear to me that after  bug 102165  was fixed, a error was introduced for saving images using the save(filename, format) method.  This should now close the outputstream since it created it and doesn't provide access to it.
From 3.2M5, Looks like the stream should be closed after the save...
public void save(String filename, int format) {
if (filename == null) SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_NULL_ARGUMENT);
OutputStream stream = null;
try {
stream = Compatibility.newFileOutputStream(filename);
} catch (IOException e) {
SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_IO, e);
}
save(stream, format);
}
