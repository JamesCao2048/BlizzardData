TextLayout font seems not the be the system font
3.4 M6.
When custom drawing table items it seems that the font used in the TextLayout isn't the same as originally used by the Table (item).
This is hard to verify as both, TextLayout.getFont() and Table(Item).getFont() return 'null'.
However, if a paint listener is added and the item string painted, then a different font is used.
It works on Windows but not on Linux-GTK.
