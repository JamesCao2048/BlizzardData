Setting a cursor only needs a flush, not a sync
When a cursor is set, SWT currently calls gdk_flush(), which does an XSync.  It
would be more efficient (and equivalent in this case) to use XFlush().  This can
be done by calling XFlush() directly, or with gdk_display_flush(), however the
GDK call is new in 2.4.
