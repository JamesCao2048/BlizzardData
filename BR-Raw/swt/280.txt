[SWT_AWT] NPE when enabling a disabled embedded shell
Build Identifier: SWT 3.7M7
Shell.setEnabled(enable) has this code:
if (enabled && window.isMainWindow())
window can be null for embedded case and should be taken into account. Being able to disable the control hierarchy (and not setEnabled on the control itself) is a useful capability which is working on other SWT ports. I may be wrong but I think this is a regression for the Mac port.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. disable an embedded shell
2. enable it
-> NPE
