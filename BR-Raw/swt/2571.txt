Drag handle changes to four-way on click
When I hover over a cool item drag handle, it appears as a two-way horizontal arrow.  When I single click, the drag handle changes to a four-way arrow.  It stays this way -- even after moving the mouse away and back again.  It only reverts to the two-way arrow after a drag is started.
This is most visible in the draggable trim elements of the workbench window, but it also happens in the top-level cool bar.
