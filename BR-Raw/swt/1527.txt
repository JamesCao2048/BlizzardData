Disable automatic horizontal scrolling on tree item selection
I200611108-1600, Vista RC2
- create a Java project with source folder, package and Java file using longer names
- open the package explorer, with small width, expand the items and select the entries one by one
> The tree viewer scolls horizontally so that the beginning of the selected item is visible. Additionaly it also scrolls back if the mouse is over a parent item (no selection required).
I remember that behavoir also existed in older windows versions and SWT found a way to prevent it from doing this...
