Loss of focus during typing
I just blamed EGit for a situation where typing text in a text field of a dialog is disrupted by focus loss (see  bug 352253 comment 30  2nd para), but then a similar issue happened in the Java editor, so I'm asking if this could be caused by a recent change in platform UI or similar?
In the editor I see the following effect:
Everytime a keystroke changes the dirty flag (set or unset in case of Ctrl-z) the editor looses focus.
At a closer check, even plain text editors are affected.
After focus loss, none of the normal hotkeys work, only menu accelerators do (proving that the window still has the focus somewhere).
SDK is I20120828-0800, the bug in the editor seems to be really new.
FWIW: I'm on Kubuntu 12.04.
