Coolbar - odd dispose behavior
Run the attached test case.
Press the Remove button.
The remove action will remove the first coolitem.  First the coolitem's
associated toolbar is disposed, then it executes setControl(null) for the
coolitem, then it disposes the coolitem.
Note that the setControl(null) method cause an SWTException, which is odd.
