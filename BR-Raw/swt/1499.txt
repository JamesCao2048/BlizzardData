Improve performance of shell creation on GTK
We have a benchmark that did "new Shell()" that was slower on GTK than Windows.  Here is how we fixed it:
Shell creation on a single monitor system takes longer then it needs to. It calls gdk_screen_get_monitor_at_window() when there is only ever one monitor possible.  We optimized this case.
