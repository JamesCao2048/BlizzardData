Package Explorer allways centers opened file
I've got build I20021204, and one annoying feature is that when a file (File1)
is opened by double-clicking it in Package Explorer, it gets centered.
The
problem is that it takes some time to eclipse to open the file, and if I'm
trying to open more than one file in the same package, I put the mouse over the
next to be opened file (File2).
Since the Package Explorer center File1, File2
changes place and I have to move the mouse again...
I also find annoying when switching the file being edited Package Explorer
center the selected file, when the file is viewable in the list.
I think that the best behaviour would be:
- When opening a file, Package Explorer shouldn't do anything (besides opening
the file ;) )
- When switching from file in the editor, if the file is viewable in Package
Explorer, change the selection to that file, without centering it
- When switching from file in the editor, if file is not viewable in Package
Explorer, change the selection to that file, centering it
