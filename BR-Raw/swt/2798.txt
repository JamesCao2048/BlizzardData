Intro Test A.4 Eclipse crashed.
3.1 RC1.  Executing Test A4 crashed Eclipse.  I clicked Workbench basics, it
opened fine, Team Support opened fine, but Java development crashed JVM.
I restared Eclipse tried again and cannot reproduce.
This is probably a dup of some existing bug, but I have not installed any
samples.  Just to let you know.
