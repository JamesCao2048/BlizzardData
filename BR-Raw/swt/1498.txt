StyledText#setSelection() does not reveal caret with non-zero selection
HEAD
A variant of  bug 209468 :
StyledText#setSelection() does not reveal caret with non-zero selection. Steps:
- CustomControlExample > StyledText
- Size: 50 X 50
- Set/Get API
- setSelection to 16,19
- give focus to the text area without changing the caret location (e.g. click
to the StyledText tab and then press the Tab key)
=> caret is not visible (it is just after "fox", but the user does not know how far the selection extends out of the visible area)
