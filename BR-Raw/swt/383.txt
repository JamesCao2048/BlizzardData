GC with Transform crashes when rendering TextLayout with strikeout and selection
Build Identifier: 20110218-0911
On Windows (XP, Vista and 7), when trying to render a TextLayout with strikeout style and a selection on this style, the GC with a transform crashes the JVM with the following error:
#
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x09d01f00, pid=3116, tid=2340
#
# JRE version: 6.0_25-b06
# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (20.0-b11 mixed mode, sharing windows-x86 )
# Problematic frame:
# C  0x09d01f00
Apparently any transform will cause the problem, even if an empty transform.
It doesn't happen to bold, italic, underline or any other style.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a TextLayout with some text and a strike out style.
2.On paint, set a transform on the GC.
3.Draw the text layout with selection containing the range which is struck out.
