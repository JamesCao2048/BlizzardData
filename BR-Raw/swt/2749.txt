resetting clipping path doesn't work when transforms are involved
Eclipse 3.1 Release on Mac OS X 10.4.1
A clipping path set with setClipping(Path) is not reset by setClipping(null) if
a transform has been used before on the GC.
This happens on Mac OS X (10.4.1)
but not on Windows XP.
See the following code fragment:
Device device = Display.getDefault();

// create an image 100x100
Image image = new Image(device,100,100);
GC gc = new GC(image);

// fill image with solid green
Color green = new Color(device,0,255,0);
gc.setBackground(green);
gc.fillRectangle(0,0,100,100);

// set a transformation and reset it again
Transform transform = new Transform(device,1.5f,0,0,1.5f,0,0);
gc.setTransform(transform);
gc.setTransform(null);

// set a clipping path and reset it again
Path clipPath = new Path(device);
clipPath.addRectangle(25,25,50,50);
gc.setClipping(clipPath);
// gc.setClipping(25,25,50,50);
gc.setClipping((Region)null);

// fill image with solid red
Color red = new Color(device,255,0,0);
gc.setBackground(red);
gc.fillRectangle(0,0,100,100);

On Mac OS X the red rectangle is clipped to clipPath despite explicitely
resetting the clipping path.
On XP it works as expected (red rectangle fills
whole image).
Workaround: if the clipping path has been set via setClipping(x,y,w,h), a
following reset works (uncomment gc.setClipping(25,25,50,50) in the above code
fragment).
Also, if there is never any transformation set, it works without the
workaround!
