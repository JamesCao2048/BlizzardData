ExpandableWidget#setText/layout messes up StyledText in it
When StyledText is in ExpandableWidget and ExpandableWidget#setText
and ExpandableWidget#layout are called, StyledText's redraw doesn't
work so that if some refresh event, i.e. iconify/deiconify happens,
its content isn't redrawn correctly. Here is how to.
a) Install the attached plugin.
b) Run workbench
c) Window > Show view > Other ...
d) Sample Category > ExpandableWidget view
e) Open Inner section(0), then open Nested section(0)
f) Copy and Paste very long string in StyledText next to the label of "Second
label" ( You can type here instead of Copy and Paste. If so, while typing,
you will see a refresh problem so that you don't have to do g) and h) below)
g) Make sure that the pasted string is wrapped. ( So that you will see multiple
lines in StyledText. See Fig 1 in the attached picture )
h) Iconify/Deiconify the workbench window
You will see the content in StyleText is gone. ( Fig 2 )
