[cocoa, gef] Guide markers not fully visible on Cocoa
Build Identifier: I20100312-1448
Guide markers are only half visible on Cocoa
- they extend below the bottom/right edge of the ruler.
Issue is due to the following method not taking Cocoa into account when detecting Mac OS X:
> private static Rectangle calculateRulerTrim(Canvas canvas) {
> 	if ("carbon".equals(SWT.getPlatform())) { //$NON-NLS-1$
Will supply a patch changing the offending line to:
> if (Platform.OS_MACOSX.equals(Platform.getOS())) {
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a GEF editor with a ruler on Cocoa
2.Click in the ruler area to create a guide
3.Observe that the guide is only partly visible
