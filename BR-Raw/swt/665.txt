DirectoryDialog does not remember last selected directory
For 3.6m7 I fixed a bug where FileDialogs didn't remember the last selected directory on subsequent calls to open(). DirectoryDialogs have the same bug, and I missed it when I fixed FileDialog.
See the original FileDialog bug for steps to reproduce. They apply here, too.
