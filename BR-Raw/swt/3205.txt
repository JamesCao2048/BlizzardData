DirectoryDialog widget does not allow resize to smaller width
The DirectoryDialog control on Linux does not seem to allow the user to resize
the dialog to a width smaller than the longest string displayed in the dialog.
Windows does not seem to have this problem -- it both wraps the string and also
allows for resizing to a width smaller than even the wrapped string (though I
think there may be another problem here in that rezising does not repaint the
control, because if resizing on Windows to a width smaller than the displayed
string, and then resizing back wider -- the string is not repainted).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Eclipse (tried this on 3.0 and 3.0.1 RC1)
2. Open Help > Software Updates > Manage Configuration...
3. Click Add an Extension Location
On Linux, the width of this dialog is fairly large, to accomodate the long
message in the dialog.  Attempts to resize to a smaller width fail.  But can
resize width to a larger size (and height larger as well).
On Windows, the width of this dialog is reasonable, because the text has been
wrapped.  Dialog can be resized here, but text is not resized as well -- this
is not a huge issue, but when resizing width larger again, the text is not
repainted.
This behavior causes issues on lower resolutions (message runs off sides of
screen) with no remedy (other than dragging the window around so that the
entire message can be read).
Attempts to force wrapping of text prior to setMessage() for the dialog work
okay, but then the text is always centered (on Linux), and does not look
correct -- I would think this would need to be right-justified.
