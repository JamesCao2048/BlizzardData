GC.setAdvanced(false) changes line width from 0 to 2
I am doing some painting at width==2, followed by some more painting at
width==0. Then, I call setAdvanced(false). After stepping over
setAdvanced(false), the line width gets changed back to 2. I do some more
painting and expected the width to still be 0.
