TrayItem icon stays activated after invoking a pop-up menu item
When you have a TrayItem in Mac OS X that has a selection listener (icon in mac's menubar (tray) that reacts to left-click), the icon remains activated (blue) after some popup menu item that was invoked by left-clicking the TrayItem.
Also, the icon remains activated when you invoke the popup menu and navigate away to desktop
- popup menu hides, but TrayItem icon remains blue.
Clicking the icon itself toggles the activation.
Also, according to mac conventions, the activation effect (blue selection around the transparent icon) should disappear when you hover the mouse over next menubar item (i.e.
the wireless network status...).
This does not happen either.
Meanwhile the right-click (menu detect listener) works fine,
Some code and an example transparent icon is attached to test it.
I've tried a million different ways before listing this bug, so please make sure you have a working solution before telling me that this code snippet is wrong.
