UI-Thread blocked while Menu is visible
SWT: 3.2 Final
MacOS X 10.4.6 with recent Java update
Hardware: Mac Intel
I saw this using RSSOwl.
While loading some feeds, I clicked on a MenuItem of the main menu to have the entries visible.
Usually, while loading Feeds, there is a progress-label indicating progress, but while having the Menu visible, nothing happens.
The application is run from an application bundle (no java_swt bridge!) having the "StartOnMainThread" parameter supplied.
