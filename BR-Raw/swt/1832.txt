Test case
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
1.run attached test case
2.click on "Dispose Text"
-> works
3.click on "Dispose Browser"
-> get an SWTException
More information:
I have not found any indication that it is illegal to dipose a parent control in the dispose listener of a child.
In fact, I've tried some and you can do that with all of them.
The browser control however will produce an exception.
