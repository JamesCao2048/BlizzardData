[Contributions] NullPointerExceptions in MenuManager.update
Today, with no apparent cause, my Eclipse (with MyEclipse, but as will be described later, I've eliminated
MyEclipse as a cause) started displaying dialogs that "an error has occurred" when performing various
operations (opening files, closing files, committing to CVS). Checking the logs revealed that NPEs were
occurring in MenuManager.update, essentially whenever I clicked on anything.
Initially I thought perhaps something in my workspace was corrupted, so I quit Eclipse and created a
new workspace... same problem. Then I freshly unpacked a new Eclipse 3.1 and did not install
MyEclipse in it, and let it create another new workspace on startup... same problem. I also tried to
switch the default VM on my Mac OS X 10.4.2 system back to 1.4 (I use 1.5 normally)... same problem.
So I'm reporting it in the hope that somebody can either figure out what in my configuration that I
didn't manage to delete is causing the problem, or figure out what in Eclipse is causing the problem.
System information, in case it'll be useful: PowerBook G4, 15", 1.5GHz, 1.5GB memory. It was 1.25GB
memory until today, but Eclipse was working fine for a while even with the new memory, and it doesn't
seem to me that that would be likely to cause this sort of issue anyway.
