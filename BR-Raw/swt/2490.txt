TreeItem not showing text
I20060317-1315
I don't have a simple SWT test case for this yet, but the behavior can be seen using the folloing test case in the debugger (works on GTK, does not work on XP).
Debug the following program (breakpoint on first line)
public class NowYouSeeIt {
public static void main(String[] args) {
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i ++) {
Integer integer = new Integer(i);
System.out.println(integer);
}
}
}
* Step over the declaration of "integer" (it appears in variables view)
* Step over, step over (println, then "integer" disappears - out of scope)
* Step over, step over (integer is back in scope, but its label does not appear)
The "data" of the item appears to be set, cause selecting does show the proper 'toString()' in the details area.
