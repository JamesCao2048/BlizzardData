inconsistent SWT.NO_FOCUS behaviour
1) w2k:
the flag is ignored when provided as a style to a Shell instead
of some widget.
linux:
the flag is respected.
2) linux:
the flag has effect for the widget and all its children.
w2k:
the flag has only effect for the widget itself (except
if the widget is a Shell)
3) There should be better documentation about how the flag effects
focus events.
