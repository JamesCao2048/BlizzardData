JVM terminates when closing web broser with Command W on Mac OS X
- find a .html file in one of your projects.
- open the .html file with the web browser
- close that editor tab using Command W
-> JVM running eclipse terminates reproducible
It seems to be important to use Command W. Using the mouse just closes the
editor Tab.
Environment:
Eclipse 3.2M1
Safari Version 2.0 (412.2)
Mac OS X 10.4.2 Build 8C46
$ java -version
java version "1.4.2_07"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_07-215)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-50, mixed mode)
JDK 1.5.0 is installed but I believe it is not used in this case.
