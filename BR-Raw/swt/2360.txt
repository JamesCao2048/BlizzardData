CTRL+F crashes JVM in Search panel.
** Detail **
Using Eclipse 3.2 RC7, on JVM 1.5.0_04, on Linux 2.6.12-1 (Fedora Core 3)
I'm editing a Java/Swing project using CVS.
I know for a fact this has been happening since at least RC4; probably much earlier.
** Description **
After performing a Search on the project, focus the search panel which appears and try CTRL+f to find.
Guessing it's to do with loading the little pop-up find box which appears in the search pane; work ok before you perform a search, but not after.
This happens every time without fail for me, over several fresh eclipse releases.
** Steps to reproduce **
1.open your workspace, open a project.
2.perform a Search (not a find) of _any_ kind (using CTRL+H, the menus, whatever).
The search needn't turn up any results, but it must be performed.
3.focus the search panel which pops up by clicking on it
4.press CTRL+F
5.kaboom!
** Error Message **
JVM packs in with the following error (in a little dialog):
"JVM terminated.
