Control+backspace key combination does not work in Text widgets
In an input box when the control+backspace key combination is pressed the
behaviour is strange. An empty rectangle is drawn.
Reproducibility: always
Steps to reproduce:
1. Find an editor having an Text widget.
2. Write some content separated by spaces, like "asdf asdf asdf asdf" (without
the quotes).
3. Erase words with the control+backspace combination key.
Actual result:
Empty rectangles (probably representing the control+backspace key combination)
are written.
Expected result:
A word must be erased each time the control+backspace key combination is pressed.
