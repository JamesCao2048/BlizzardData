StyledText - move StyledTextRenderer#bidiTextWidth to DisplayRenderer
build 20020321
bidiTextWidth is used by the StyledTextRenderer to calculate the line start
location on bidi platforms. This is important for display rendering because of
the bidi caret inset. For printing however there is no need for a bidi caret
inset.
The current method should be moved to DisplayRenderer, made abstract in
StyledTextRenderer and just return 0 in the PrintRenderer.
StyledTextRenderer#getLastCaretDirection could then also be moved to
PrintRenderer and removed completely in StyledTextRenderer.
