Browser widget: Tab key traps focus when key listener is added
I20080508-2000
Focus handling in the Browser widget is screwed as soon as I add a key listener (KeyUp or KeyDown) to the Browser.
Steps in ControlExample:
- add key listener
- click into browser, just before the first link
- press Tab to focus first link
- press Shift+Tab
=> should: put focus to the "Browser" TabItem
=> does: first puts you into a state where nothing really has focus (Up/DownArrow keys don't scroll the browser any more).
On second press of Shift+Tab, puts focus the last link in the browser.
- click into the "Browser" TabItem
- press Tab
=> should: put focus to the browser
=> does: puts focus into a black hole.
There's no way to get the focus back from this state using the Tab key.
I think the problem is that Browser is a subclass of Composite, and adding a key listener to the composite makes it take focus.
Even with a key listener, the Browser widget should behave like e.g.
a Tree and still correctly implement focus traversal (e.g.
by passing focus to the contained WebSite control).
