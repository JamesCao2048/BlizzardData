printing to non-default printer no longer works properly
from the newsgroup:
"
I have 2 printers:
1. CITIZEN CTS-4000. This is a kitchen printer with  paper width 112 mm
2. Kyocera with A4 a paper
If in Windows I define the first printer as standard, our prints to
Kyocera are wrong! Text-Face is too big and page-size is too small.
This configuration was working with swt 3.4 but is now not working with swt 3.5.
