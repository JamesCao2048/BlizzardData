[Browser-Mozilla] document.open() fails.
Created  attachment 136685   [details]
Simple test case showing the JS document.open() bug.
Build ID: 3.5RC1
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Have some JS object with a method that calls document.open()
2. Call the object's method: the call to document.open() fails.
More information:
This is a regression: 3.5 M6 was working fine, M7 and RC1 have the problem. Also, this works fine with IE.
This is very problematic: several JS libraries make use of such call. I found the problem with an embedded FCKeditor (after several hours of stepping through complex JS...) but this can potentially affect many other libraries.
