BIDI: PopupList can't be created with explicitly assigned orientation.
Currently it is impossible to create Shell and List widgets of PopupList with
explicitly assigned orientation. As result, PopupList always has orientation of
top Shell. It isn't desirable if, for example, table, which use PopupList for
editing of it's cells, has orientation, that is differ from orientation of top
Shell.
