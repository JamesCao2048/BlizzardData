Version: 3.3.0
Build id: I20060906-1200
1. Open the preference dialog
2. Select the Java preferecne page
3. resize the dialog horizontally as small as it will go
4. slowly increase the width of the dialog (from the right hand side)
5. The radio buttons in the "When opening a type heirarchy" section do not repaint correctly.  hovering over the buttons forces them to replaint and the issue goes away.
See screenshot for an example.
