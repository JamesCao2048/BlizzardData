Selection jumps in tree
[Cocoa I20090514-2000]
Not sure if this potentially affects all trees, or only filtered ones.
Steps:
1.Open Preferences dialog
2.Make sure it comes up all collapsed, with the first item (General) selected.
If not, collapse tree and select the first item, close the dialog, and open again.
3.Expand "General".
4.Click on "Appearance"
Expected: "Appearance" gets selected
Actual: "Editors" gets selected.
