Editor popup has wrong size
Build: 20051101-0010
All of the [editor/view/perspective] selection popups in this build are sized
incorrectly, requiring a vertical scroll-bar no matter how many entries are in
the popup.  This only started happening with today's build. I will attach a
screen shot showing the same editor selection popup with I20051101-0010 versus
I20051031-0800 (which did not exhibit the problem).
