FileDialog open() returns wrong result
The snippet at the bottom opens a file dialog, leaves the user to select some
file, then prints the path of the selected file after the user presses OK.  It
gets its result from the return value of the FileDialog.open() invocation.
On all platforms except hpux this returns a full path (eg.-
"/opt/eclipse/jre/lib/rt.jar").  But on hpux only the last portion is answered
(eg.- "rt.jar").  This inconsistency is quite bad because it prevents the file
selection function on the Java -> Classpath Variables preference page from
working properly.
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;
public class FileDialogFullPath {
public static void main(String[] args) {
FileDialog dialog = new FileDialog(new Shell());
String result = dialog.open();
System.out.println("open result: " + result);
}
}
