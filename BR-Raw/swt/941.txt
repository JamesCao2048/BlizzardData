can't see text cursor after setting dark background color
3.5M7, Build ID: I20090430-2300
Steps To Reproduce:
1.set the background to a dark color and the forground to a light color
More information:
I tune my preferences so that my backgrounds are dark and my
foregrounds are light
- I don't like staring into a light all
day.
It's a pain to change all the Eclipse preferences to make
this work, but I've done it.
I can't find preferences that control the color of the text
cursor or the mouse cursor, so they disappear or are hard to see.
The text color seems to blink between my background color and
black, so it disappears completely if my background is black.
The mouse cursor (shaped like an I-beam) seems to be dark grey,
so it's barely visible.
Perhaps there are preferences that control this, but I couldn't
find them.
