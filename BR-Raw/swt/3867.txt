Color selection dialog takes a long time to display in 8-bit mode
Overview Description:
The 鈥榗olor selection鈥 dialog takes up to 15 seconds to appear
on Solaris, whereas, the dialog comes up almost instantaneously
on HPUX.
This behavior occurs on the first and subsequent
color change requests.
NOTE: It doesn鈥檛 seem to matter where you originate the color
Selection request, the delay is the same (i.e.
Color selection from
The Preferences dialog takes the same amount of time as a color
Selection request from the SWT Examples software / SWT Controls
View.
Steps to reproduce:
1.	Open the workbench Preferences dialog
2.	Select the 鈥楯ava鈥 category, and open the 鈥楨ditor鈥 preferences page
3.	Select the 鈥楢ppearance鈥 tab
4.	Select the 鈥楥olor鈥 button
!BUG!  There is a long wait time for the color selection dialog (the amount
of time is a usability issue!)
