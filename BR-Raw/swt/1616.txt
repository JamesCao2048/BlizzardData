Opening a modal dialog while an ON_TOP shell is active should activate the dialog

- run the attached snippet
- click "Show Tooltip"
=> tooltip shown
- click "Open Dialog"
=> expected (works like this on WinXP): Dialog is shown an activated, "tooltip deactivated" is written to stdout
=> was on carbon: Dialog is shown, but tooltip shell stays active
This causes  bug 223858 .
I'll try to put in a workaround that explicitly hides the tooltip to avoid  bug 223858  for M6.
