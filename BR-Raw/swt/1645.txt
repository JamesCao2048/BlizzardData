TOGGLE Buttons inherit background with SWT.INHERIT_DEFAULT
Set a custom background color and background mode SWT.INHERIT_DEFAULT on a composite that contains PUSH and TOGGLE buttons. Although both button types look the same, the TOGGLE buttons inherit the background color of the composite but PUSH buttons do not.
This will probably not happen with Windows, as Windows buttons can not take a background color.
