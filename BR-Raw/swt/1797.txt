More information:
1.We debugged into Eclipse code, and saw there is an XPCOM error within the OnStateChange callback, and in hookDOMListeners method.
2.After we use try/catch blocks to catch Throwable, we can see an exception, and this time, it won't crash the Eclipse.
3.As I suggested months ago, SWT should try to catch Java exception/throwables in the Callbacks, and notify the errors either in UI thread, or on console.
An uncaught Java exception will cause a crash of whole eclipse client.
