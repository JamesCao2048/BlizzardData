Replace GdkRegion with Cairo methods for GTK + 3.0 and higher
To avoid dependency issues I decided to put all GdkRegion  methods in one place.
(I will mark as duplicates all the patches regarding GdkRegion that I opened before this bug)
To Note: As In Gtk3 there is typedef  cairo_rectaingle_int_t GdkRectangle, I have used GdkRectangle for all the operations that required cairo_rectangle_int_t
