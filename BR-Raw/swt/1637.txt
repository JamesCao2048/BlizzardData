+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of  Bug #216103  +++
Build ID: 3.4
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Import the SWT project into Eclipse
2. Run it
3. Don't do anything, just mouse move on the pop-up window(named "SWT Window")
4. Please look at the console log.
Problem is: text2.setFocus return true. But disp.getFocusControl return null. For there is an inconsistency in the implementation of setFocus and GetFocusControl. That is, setFocus will not call SetFocusWindow while GetFocusControl will use  GetFocusWindow.
More information:
setFocus should call SetFocusWindow when the associated window is not the focus window. It will make SWT more robust.
