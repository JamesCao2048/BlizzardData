Java project with Hebrew data for import
Build ID: IES3.4 B20080207-1530
Platform: MAC OS X 10.5
1. Import java project from attached zip (you should use UTF-8 encoding)
2. Open Hebrew-named java file and examine line 9.
Result: hebrew data is treated wrongly. I am attaching screenshot of the same file on Win and Mac OSs
