Accelerators are not disabled when the toolbars and menus are on GTK
When the toolbars and menus are disabled in the UI due to a UI blocking
operation being run the accelerators are still active.
STEPS
1) Open a java editor
2) Save it using Ctrl-S - the menu and toolbars are disabled
3) Hit Ctrl-B (the build) while the menu bars are disabled - this will get
serviced even though the UI should not be accepting events.
