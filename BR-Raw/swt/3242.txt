TextLayout: font substitution support
On Windows, org.eclipse.swt.graphics.TextLayout should support font
substitution.
If the user types any text not supported by the current font on StyledText
which calls TextLayout, the text becomes blank (in Eclipse3.0M9) on Windows.
For Example, if the user selects "Microsoft Sans Serif" font on Windows, and
type Japanese text which "Microsoft Sans Serif" font does not contain, then
notepad.exe still can display Japanese text.
It is because notepad.exe supports
font substitution and finds Japanese "MS Gothic" or something like that.
(maybe
because notepad.exe may simply call TextOutW(), though.)
Since StyledText/TextLayout is implemented by Uniscribe, TextLayout should
support font substitution.
