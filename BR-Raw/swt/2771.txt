[preferences] Changing Code Formatter tab width does not change displayed tab width in open editor
I20050215-2300
- Java project with project-specific code formatter settings
- open a CU of this project
- change tab width from 4 to 2
-> expected: displayed width of a tab character is now 2
-> was: still 4
The code formatter settings are already applied on Source > Format.
Closing and reopening the editor gives the correct new width.
