Toolbar with only separator(s) should not be in tab order
Eclipse 4.2 M6
Eclipse 4.2 creates toolbars with only 1 separator tool in them to separate the toolbars.
(This simulates the old coolbar).
On Windows, tab traversal ignores the separator-only-toolbars (which is good).
On Mac, tab traverses to the separator-only-toolbar, and this is not good.
To see this, traverse in the forward direction with ctrl+tab until you reach the toolbar.
Then keep tabbing forward, and notice that there are too many tab keys required to tab from toolbar to toolbar.
