CTabFolder creates and disposes a Shell on every MouseHover
CTabFolder.showToolTip() currently does the following:
On MouseHover:
- create a temporary shell
- if there's a tooltip:
set it and show it
- otherwise:
dispose the shell
There are no tooltips for the tabs used for views in Eclipse.  As you hover over
each tab, a new Shell is created and disposed on each MouseHover event.
