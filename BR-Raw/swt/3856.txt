Info pops do not work for Red Hat 8.0.
While developing in Red Hat 8.0 using eclipse 2.0.1 with Version: 2.0.1
Build id: 200208291828
Whenever I open a help infopop by pressing F1, the infopop does not work.
The
links cannot be accessed, and the mouse does not even change cursors on hovering
over them.
Furthermore, I cannot return to the workbench to continue working, the infopop
remains "on top" of my workbench and will not go away.
The only way I can make the infopop go away is to switch Linux workspaces,
either by clicking on one of the four available in the menu bar or by pressing
<ctrl>+<alt>+<an arrow key> and then returning to the Linux workspace that
contains my eclipse workbench.
When I return using this manner the infopop is gone.
