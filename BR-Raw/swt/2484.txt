Snippet URL:  http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet212.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
The embedded image will be overlapped with text.
If change the placeholder "uFFFC" to other character(such as u0014), it will be ok.
