Slow performance updating target
I have a target platform with ~400 plugins.
I'm using dynamic classpaths.

When I go to the PDE preferences, reload a new target, click not in workspace,
and hit ok, it takes a very long time before I have control again.
Seems like some refresh is going on as well as threads in the job queue.
This
is using M7 as the development environment.
