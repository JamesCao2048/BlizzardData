gio_getMimeInfo' seems to leak a file descriptor to "/usr/share/mime/globs" on every call
When running under CDT, I can use eclipse for a while.  Eventually, (within 12-14 hours), I can no longer save modified files.  I also cannot save the workspace state upon exiting.  When looking at the "Details" area of the error box, the system complains that too many files are open.   Indeed, when I do an 'ls -al' of /proc/<PID>/fd  (where PID is the process ID associated with java/Eclipse), the system reports '/usr/share/mime/globs' is opened 878 times.
I am running Fedora 11 on x86_64 and Sun's jre 1.6.0_16.    I was able to reproduce this with a few different projects.
