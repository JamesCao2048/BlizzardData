defaultButton for a Shell is not getting unset after clicking on any button on the Shell
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5

After clicking on any button in a shell Button.gtk_focus_in_event() is setting this specific button as the defaultButton for the shell. Later Button.gtk_focus_out_event() is getting hit, but as (!OS.GTK_WIDGET_HAS_DEFAULT(handle)) is returning false defaultButton for Shell is not getting set to null.
Because of this, in Decorations.traverseReturn() the value of button is not null and hence in TypedListener.handleEvent(), KeyDown event is not getting generated. We have a set of functions that should get called in keyDown event. Because of this problem our functions are not getting called.
This happens only in Linux.
In Windows, the corresponding function is LRESULT WM_SETFOCUS () and LRESULT WM_KILLFOCUS (). Here the defaultButton for Shell is getting set to null in LRESULT WM_KILLFOCUS () and hence keyDown event is getting generated.
Note: In Linux I see that menu.defaultButton is used for setting the defaultButton instead of using the setter (Decorations.setDefaultButton). Please use the setter as this makes debugging easier.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Shell with a button.
2.Click on the button.
3.Button gets set as the defaultButton for the shell.
4.But later it does not get set to null.
Note: Happens only on linux
