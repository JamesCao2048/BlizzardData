StyledText - Scrollwheel event interferes with last caret placement
Styled text remembers the last horizontal offset of the caret in a line.
If
you are at the end of a really long line, and you press DOWN to a short line,
then UP, the caret's placement is recalled and it is at the end of the line
again.
But, if you press DOWN to a short line, then use the scrollwheel, which does
NOT move the caret, then press UP, the caret's location is not recalled.
