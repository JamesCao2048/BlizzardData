Native tooltips left around on CTabFolder
Hover over the PartStack CTabFolder inside eclipse until some native tooltip is
displayed.  For example, the maximize button.  When the tooltip appears, change
perspectives using the keybinding.
the CTabFolder gets hidden, but its tooltip is permanently displayed and never
goes away.  Even if that CTabFolder is disposed (I'm assuming) when the
perspective is closed.
