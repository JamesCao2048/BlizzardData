Command+. does not work any more in Trees
Broken in I20100119-0800 and 3.5 Cocoa, works in 3.4.2 Carbon.
Command+. does not work any more in Trees. I just get an OS beep, and the KeyDown event for Command+. is missing.
In Eclipse, this is e.g. visible in the Search view, where Command+. should step to the next match. The reverse (Command+Shift+.) still works.
In the Java Editor, Command+. still works (jumps to next annotation).
