GC.copyArea causes continuous repainting of Canvas
Using the second variant of copyArea, that specifies source and destination
within the receiver, causes a rapid continous redrawing of the canvas,
noticeable as a rapid flickering over the source position of the copyArea
command.
The attached example shows this by drawing an Image on a Canvas and then
copying a fragment of the Image to be displayed at different position
on the Canvas, using both copyArea methods.
