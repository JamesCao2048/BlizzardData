GC.drawImage() selects wrong source region
When the source and destination areas are of differing sizes, the method does not select the source region at srcX, srcY.
Thus, the wrong source region is placed in the receiver.
I have created a simple test case to demonstrate this, and will also attach screenshots using SWT.getVersion()=3139 and SWT.getVersion()=3212. The earlier version works properly, so I think we're dealing with a regression bug.
Interestingly, the same problem occurs in 3212 whether I use GC.setAdvanced(true) GC.or setAdvanced(false).
