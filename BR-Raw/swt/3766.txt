Keys preference page table column not sized correctly
build RC2
-open the Workbench/Keys preference page
->note how the first three columns are sized very small.
Column 0 has the same
size as on Windows and appears to be empty anyway.
However, the contents of
column 1 and 2 is not readable.
I also cannot resize the columns.
On Windows the columns are sized properly and I can resize them.
