cannot use icons with > 8 bit color depth
eclipse complains when you ask it to load an icon (*.ico) file having
greater than 8-bit color depth. i have tracked the error down to the
following lines in WinICOFileFormat::loadInfoHeader():
if (!((width == infoWidth) && (height * 2 == infoHeight) &&
((bitCount == 1) || (bitCount == 4) || (bitCount == 8))))
SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_INVALID_IMAGE);
this is a problem on windows as many icons are 24 bit.
