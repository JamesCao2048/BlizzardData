Quick-Typehierarchy's treeviewer cannot be collapsed with mouse
When opening a quick typehierarchy (Ctrl-T) on a type with several levels (e.g.
java.awt.Window), the embedded treeviewer shows the usual handles for closing and opening subtrees.
Clicking on such a handle opens the class next to the handle instead of opening/closing the subtree.
Steps to reproduce:
- open java.awt.Window in an editor
- select 'Window' class name
- press Ctrl-t
- click on the little handle next to the "JDialog" entry
