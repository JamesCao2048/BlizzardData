GTK: Multiple selection and right click in tree
Build 20021015
Linux-GTK
A right click on a multiple selection unselects everything and selects just the
element on which the right click was performed.
1. In the package view, select multiple elements (with [CTRL]+left button or
[SHIFT]+left button)
2. Right click on a selected element.
The element on which the right click was performed is selected (all other
elements are unselected).
The context menu displayed contains the elements for the multiple selection.
3. Select an action.
The action is executed on the selected element only.
A workaround to the problem is to use the right button with [CTRL] or [SHIFT]
for create the selection.
