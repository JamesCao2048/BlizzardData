Program.findProgram("html") returns null when there's no default command
R3.0
I used Program.findProgram("html") to find the browser and null was returned
even though Mozilla is registered to open html documents.
I debugged the code and my registry and found that I had no default command in
my registry and hence the following code in
org.eclipse.swt.program.Program.getProgram(String) fails/returns null:
1)  String defaultCommand = getKeyValue (key + DEFAULT_COMMAND, true);
2)  if (defaultCommand == null) defaultCommand = "open"; //$NON-NLS-1$
Reason: after 1) defaultCommand is "" and not null hence defaultCommand is not
set to "open" in 2). Either getKeyValue(...) should return null or the if should
read:
if (defaultCommand == null || defaultCommand.length == 0)
defaultCommand = "open"; //$NON-NLS-1$
