Vista Tracker incredibly slow
Using the Vista Aero theme try dragging a view with its own stack (for the best effect use the bottom stack in the Java perspective or anyother one with a few tabs).
You should see an XOR rect as the insertion feedback.
On my dual 3Ghz processor / 3GB box it's about 1/2 a sec per rectangle draw.
This drawing is done by the set.custom.Tracker...
My best guess is that it's getting hosed by the transparency handling (it works better if you switch to the 'Windows Classic' setup).
