Deprecated method being used in Tree, List, and Table
According to the Cocoa documentation, the method [NSTableView selectRow:byExtendingSelection:] is deprecated, and that

- (void)selectRowIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)indexes byExtendingSelection:(BOOL)extend
should be used instead.
The deprecated version is used in the following methods:
List
dragDetect(int, int, boolean, boolean[])
menuForEvent(int, int, int)
Table
dragDetect(int, int, boolean, boolean[])
menuForEvent(int, int, int)
Tree
dragDetect(int, int, boolean, boolean[])
menuForEvent(int, int, int)
select(TreeItem)
This could be a problem in the future, as it was documented as deprecated as of 10.3.
