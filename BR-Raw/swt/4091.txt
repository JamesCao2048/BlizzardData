weird Tree selection behaviour
F1 on linux-gtk:
1) open java browsing perspective
2) click on org.apache.xerces
3) click on javax.xml.parsers
4) (sometimes) observe that the types are not populated
5) click on org.apache.html.dom
6) (sometimes) observe that now both javax.xml.parsers and
org.apache.html.dom are selected.
This is not always reproducible, but it happens about 1 out of 2 times I try
this.
It seems that somehow there's an invisible multi-selection going on.
This doesn't happen on w2k.
