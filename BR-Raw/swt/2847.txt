In console pane, cannot click "Terminate" and then "Remove all Terminated launches" without clicking somewhere else in between
This is when I terminate a Java program I'm running.
The "Remove all Terminated
launches" enables after clicking Terminate, but clicking it does nothing until I
click somewhere else first.
I believe this bug has existed for a while, I seem
to remember since I first started using eclipse, with one of the 3.0 milestone
builds.
I only experience this in GTK, works fine in windows.
