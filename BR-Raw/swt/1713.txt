Shell with ON_TOP style stay behind of Shell with APPLICATION_MODAL style.
Shell with ON_TOP style is often used as tooltip window which should always stay on top of window.
But if you create a Shell with ON_TOP style while there is an active Shell with APPLICATION_MODAL style, the Shell with ON_TOP will be behind the Shell with APPLICATION_MODAL.
A demo java file is attached.
I think the root cause is: Shell with SWT.ON_TOP is a sheet window in floating window group which z-order is below the window in modal window group.
In SWT.java, the description of SWT.ON_TOP is : "Style constant for always on top behavior".
So Shell with ON_TOP style should has higher z-order than Shell with APPLICATION_MODAL style.
