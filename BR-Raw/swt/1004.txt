Gtk SWT should set window type hint for SWT.BALLOON tooltips
Created  attachment 117530   [details]
Trivial fix
As the summary says, tooltips which have the SWT.BALLOON style flag set should also have their window type hint set to GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_TOOLTIP, which allows compositing managers to animate the tooltips properly.
For tooltips which don't have SWT.BALLOON set this is done implicitly through the Gtk tooltips API, so it's only logical also doing so for the SWT.BALLOON case.
