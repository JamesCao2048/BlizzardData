Typing in StyledText is accompanied with the error bell (Cocoa)
StyledText on Cocoa isn't usable since on every key press the error bell is played.
After short debugging I had found that keyboard events sent to all Canvas-based controls are forwarded to NSWindow via super.windowSendEvent(id, event) call. NSView which is a base for Canvas doesn't handle them so the system plays the error bell.
The attached patch solves this problem by overriding sendKeyEvent(NSEvent nsEvent, int type) method in the Canvas class and making it return "false", what blocks further processing of the event.
