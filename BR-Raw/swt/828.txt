possible leak in FileDialog
From the newsgroup, should be investigated:
I'm debugging my mixed Java/C++ application and trying to eliminate
memory leaks. I'm using the leaks(1) tool in Mac OS X, and I can see a
growing number of leaked NSCFArray and AEListImpl objects. The stack
traces show they were all created in the
Java_org_eclipse_swt_internal_carbon_OS_NavDialogRun function call. I'm
using Carbon SWT (3.4.1.v3452b); is this problem known/spurious/benign?
