Disabling Controls does not prevent popup menu from functioning
Build id: I20070208-2030
Steps:
1. On a mac, open a control such as Group
2. Check "Popup Menu" and uncheck "Enabled"
3. Right click in the Group area.
Notice that a popup menu appears. On other platforms (Windows, Linux) disabling a control also prevents the popup menu from appearing.
On the mac, this is apparent with all controls that have a popup menu option with exception to: Canvas, CoolBar, ExpandBar, and ToolBar, which work properly.
