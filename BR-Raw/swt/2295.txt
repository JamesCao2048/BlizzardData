The ToolTip object is not disposed appropriately and prevents from creating another ToolTip on the same shell
the new ToolTip class in SWT 3.2 can not be disposed appropritately.
On the same shell object, if a ToolTip (I used balloon style) is created and disposed, a second ToolTip (again, balloon style) object can be instantiated but will not be displayed.
The parent Shell object keeps the OS handle of the balloon Tooltip handle, but handle is not reset when the destroytooltip() method in the Shell class is invoked.
Since the old hanlde is still lingering aorund, Shell object thinks no need to ask the OS to create a new handle again.
