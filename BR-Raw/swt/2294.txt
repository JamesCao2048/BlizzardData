Misprints in SWT Win32 code ?
While porting SWT to Win64 [ Bug #57151 ],
the following 2 strange places were found:
1. Strange usage of hImage handler (may be
super.setBackgroundImage should be called ?)
org.eclipse.swt.widgets/Scale.java:285
void setBackgroundImage (int hImage) {
super.setBackgroundPixel (hImage);
2. "sizeof" is used for (maybe) wrong object
(NMLVCUSTOMDRAW instead of NMTVCUSTOMDRAW)
org.eclipse.swt.widgets/Tree.java:1075
OS.MoveMemory (lParam, nmcd, NMLVCUSTOMDRAW.sizeof);
Are these places real bugs or... ?
