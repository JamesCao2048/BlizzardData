SWT_AWT bridge on OS X reports incorrect message with failure
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
When something goes haywire with the SWT_AWT bridge on Mac OS X, the assumption is that the SWT_AWT bridge is not implemented, and the message "need SWT compatibility pack from Apple" is tucked into the exception message. All current versions of Java on OS X now contain CHIViewEmbeddedFrame, so this message is no longer valid.
The exception handling should be more specific about what has happened, and display the appropriate message.
The impact of this bug is that it leads to FUD-like threads like this one: < http://www.instantiations.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1630 >. We also get questions on Apple's java-dev asking where they can download the compatibility pack.
