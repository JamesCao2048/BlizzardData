Tree with columns has drawing errors when resizing to a minimum
Version: 3.3.0
Build id: I20070625-1500
- Run Snippet170
- If the vertical scrollbar is visible, increase the window height to avoid the vertical scroller
- Trim the window width to the width of the columns so that the horizontal scrollbar is just not visible
- Slowly reduce the height until only 1 row is visible (excluding the column header)
Problem 1: Scrollbars start flickering at some point
- seems like the widget is undecided whether scrollbars should be displayed or not
- Leave the tree at 1 1/2 rows visible (no scrollbars)
- Expand the top node
Problem 2: The second (partially visible) row is not repainted
- Make the middle column wider until scrollbars appear
- Reduce column width again until horizontal scrollbar disappears (vertical scrollbar stays)
- Increase width once again until vertical scrollbar disappears
Problem 3: The tree is almost completely blank
The scrollbar flickering (Problem 1) consumes quite some CPU time.
It can even take several seconds to calm down while freezing the UI ( bug 205078 ).
