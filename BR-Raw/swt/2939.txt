[Browser] Embedded browser fails to handle link to text file
Build 20050413
Linux-GTK
1.Point the embedded browser to  http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/scigen/#examples
2.Click on the hyperlink "follow-up email", which links to a text file.
3.Nothing happens.
My desktop web browser (Firefox) just opens the text file in the browser.
Our
embedded browser should do the same thing.
