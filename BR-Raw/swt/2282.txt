Path Clipping does not work properly on Mac, GTK and Motif
When applying a path clipping in the GraphicsExample application, the clipping does not appear as expected.
Steps for reproducing:
- Check out org.eclipse.swt.examples from CVS
- Put the attached file in your workspace under
org.eclipse.swt.examples.graphics
- Run the graphics example
- In the tree, expand "Clipping" and select "Path Clipping"
- Select different items in the drop-down menu.
- Note: that these clipping examples appear correctly on Windows.
