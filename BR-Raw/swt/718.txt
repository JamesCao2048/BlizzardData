GIF with origin geometry wrongly render transparency on windows 7
Eclipse 3.5.1
Sorry if this is a dup, I didn't find anything similar.
Some GIF images produce wrong transparency rendering on Windows 7. Apparently, the problematic images specify an "Origin geometry" to offset the real image contents from the top-left corner.
For the affected images, ImageMagick::identify -verbose says something like the following:
Geometry: 13x14+0+0
...
Page geometry: 16x16+0+2
Origin geometry: +0+2
For normal (working) images, the output is:
Geometry: 16x16+0+0
...
Page geometry: 16x16+0+0
The images were created using GIMP.
When used as icons in a label provider, the problematic images have their transparent pixels filled with another palette color. I will attach screenshots and example images.
