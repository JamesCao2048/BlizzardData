Linux-GTK
1. Launch the ControlExample and go to the Coolbar tab.
2. Select the SWT.DROP_DOWN style.
3. In the middle coolbar, grab the sash and pull it all the way to the left
such that the pulldown menu appears for the second item.
4. Click on the pulldown arrow.
5. The item in the pulldown has no icon. The buttons in the right toolbar
(the ones with no chevron) retain their icons when they appear in the
pulldown.
