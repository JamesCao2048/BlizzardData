SWT_AWT broken on Mac OS X Leopard (10.5.8)
Build Identifier: 3.7 final
NPE at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell.createHandle(Shell.java:735)
Using the simple test case attached, there is a NPE each time one tries to create a new Shell, see the terminal output attached with stackTrace.
OS is Mac OS X 10.5.8
I've tried with:
- Java 6 1.6.0_26 - 64-bit
- Java 5 1.5.0_30 - 64-bit
- Java 5 1.5_0_30 - 32-bit
All with the same result.
Some users reported the same issue with Java 6 1.6.0_24 - always on Leopard 10.5.8
The same code runs fine in Snow Leopard 10.6.8
This is a critical issue for us since it basically breaks Leopard compatibility.
Thanks for having a look.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the sample code attached
2. NPE happends at line 32 - caused by Shell.createHandle(Shell.java:735)
