Failed to create Citrix Client v12
Build Identifier: eclipse SDK 3.4
SWT crashes when creating an OLE object of the Citrix client v12.
Yet the same code works with previous version of the Citrix client.
I also tried to create this OLE object with Microsoft C++ and it works.
This defect is probably 50% on the Citrix side but I'd appreciate if an expert could have a look.
Rather to get a fix I would be satisfied if you could give me a workaround.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. download Citrix online plugin at:  http://www.citrix.com/English/ss/downloads/details.asp?downloadId=2301299&productId=186&c1=sot2755
2.install the client
3.try this
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
Shell ret = new Shell(new Display(), SWT.SHELL_TRIM);
ret.setVisible(true);
ret.setLayout(new GridLayout(1, true));
OleFrame frame = new OleFrame(ret, SWT.NO_BACKGROUND);
OleControlSite controlSite = new OleControlSite(
frame,
SWT.NO_MERGE_PAINTS,
"{238F6F83-B8B4-11CF-8771-00A024541EE3}");
Thread.sleep(5000);
} catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
}
