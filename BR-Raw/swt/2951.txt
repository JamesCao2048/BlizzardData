linux copy-paste chinese to StyledText problem
I'm having a weird problem when I try to run my RCP app on Linux (gentoo)
which doesn't occur on the windows version.
When I try to copy and paste
chinese characters from my web browser to a StyledText widget in my app,
it pastes the character as its unicode string.
ie.
(u4f60)
However typing chinese into the StyledText and copy-pasting into
another StyledText works fine.
As does pasting from browser to a Text
widget.
Easiest way to reproduce my problem.
Use the RcpMail template and change
the Text widget in View.java to a StyledText.
Then go to a chinese site like
BBC chinese  http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/simp/hi/default.stm  and try to paste
some chinese characters in.
