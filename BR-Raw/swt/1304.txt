StyledText: block selection mode: trouble with caret and newline
I20081202-0800.
The block selection mode has troubles when I put the caret into a line and start typing: the small non-blinking caret stays (instead of the usual caret)
- even after typing
- and return does not working/is blocked.
Can be reproduced in SWT's TextEditor example.
