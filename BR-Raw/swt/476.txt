org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE.createSafeArray() does not work for cross process
Build Identifier: SWT 3.6.1
Due to a wrong flag in safeArrary was set, the safeArrary is not passed cross process successfully.
safeArray.fFeatures = OS.FADF_FIXEDSIZE | OS.FADF_HAVEVARTYPE
Actually the safeArray contain VT_UI1 but not VT_VARIANT, so the flag OS.FADF_HAVEVARTYPE should not be set up.
Without the flag, the function work well for in-process and out-of-process COM communication.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Run Snippet330 with SWT IE browser (in-process), and IBM XPD browser (support both in-process and out-of-process)
