Allow SWT to use gvfs instead of gnome-vfs
At present, SWT uses gnome-vfs on Linux/GNOME.
gnome-vfs in turn relies on HAL which is now in maintenance mode [1].
GNOME is trying to get rid of dependencies on HAL [2] and gnome-vfs [3].
Linux distributions are working to get rid of things that depend upon HAL and in turn gnome-vfs [4, 5, 6].
It would be good to allow SWT to use gvfs instead of gnome-vfs.
Compatibility with gnome-vfs should be kept for distributions which still carry gnome-vfs.
