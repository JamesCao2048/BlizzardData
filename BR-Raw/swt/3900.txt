cant type braces in java editor with italian keyboard in 2.1m1
In eclipse 2.1m1 its' impossible to type braces {} with an italian keyboard,
(in italian standard keyhboard the key combination for { is greyalt+shift+e
grave); one has to type braces using the alt+ansi code but this is very
inpractical; the problem appears in 2.1m1 for the first time; can reproduce it
on windows nt4/sp6 and windows 98SE
