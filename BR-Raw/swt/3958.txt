Background color of Graphical Editors is always black.
This bug can be reproduced by the logic example plugin.
When it is run the
entire background of the LogicEditor is black, rendering connections invisible
to the user.
The background appears correctly in windows, and in motif-eclipse.
This same bug occurs also in the plug-in we are currently developing.
Our
visualization design is similar to the logic example plug-in.
Unlike the logic
plug-in, the editor we use does not extend GraphicalEditorWithPalette, but
rather an implementation of EditorPart very similar to GraphicalEditor.
Attempts to set the background color from our custom GraphicalEditor fail.
The
call we are making to set the background color is:
protected void configureGraphicalViewer(){
getGraphicalViewer().getControl().setBackground(ColorConstants.white);
}
The same source code works correctly in motif eclipse, but I have not tested
it with windows eclipse.
This is with libgtk2.0 version 2.0.5-2 on Debian.
If
you have any questions feel free to contact me.
