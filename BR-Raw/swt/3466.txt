TableCursor always paints left-aligned text
In the case with a table that is center/right aligned, having a cursor makes
the text displayed in the cursor inconsistent with table's alignment.
TableCursor is always left-aligned and does not provide any means to allow user
to set its text alignment to match its table's alignment.
