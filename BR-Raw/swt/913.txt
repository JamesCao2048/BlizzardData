snippet
I took the SWT integration build I20090512-2000:
Once I used the carbon library and another time the cocoa. The cocoa one ignores the SWT.CENTER stylebit when you use it with the SWT.WRAP on Labels.
Full snippet is attached.
Label wrappedLabel = new Label(shell, SWT.CENTER | SWT.WRAP);
Wraps the label but doesn't center the text. Works with the carbon library.
