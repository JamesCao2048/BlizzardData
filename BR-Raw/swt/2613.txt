GLCanvas doesn't set hint for merging mouse motion events
At least on GTK, the GLCanvas doesn't merge multiple mouse motion events that
might happen to be in the event queue. Instead, it floods the listener with
lists of old events. Other widgets like Canvas do not show this behaviour.

Test case exhibiting this bug is appended. It uses a waiting event handler to
facilitate queuing of mouse motion events. You can see in the program output
that the output keeps coming long after the mouse is resting again.
