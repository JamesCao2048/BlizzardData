"Jumping" layout
I20030516
MacOS 10.2.6
Lots of relayout operations appear to be "jumpy" because an intermediate layout
becomes visible.
One good example is:
- open preference dialog
- select first node "Workbench"
- use the arrow down key to move selection to next node
Observe: on some layout changes the whole window contents (including the tree) first
moves downward and immediately jumps back to the correct position. Sometimes even
screen cheese remains in the top left corner (probably an interaction between tree
selection rectangle and a tree repositioning)
