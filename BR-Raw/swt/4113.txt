ViewForm should override computeTrim
In the current ViewForm implementation, it is not possible to calculate the
required bounds rectangle for a desired client area since computeTrim is not
overridden.
It seems to me that, in general, any control that provides a
getClientArea implementation should also override computeTrim.
This also affects the fix for 10025, where minimum dimension calculations
depend on computeTrim to correctly account for trimmings.
