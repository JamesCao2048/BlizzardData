Text widget has inconsistent font sizes on the mac
Some of the section descriptions in the plugin editor are cut off.  The fonts used in these sections also seem to be a bit large and may be contributing to the problem. I'm not sure if this should be logged against UA or PDE... screencap of one such section forthcoming.
