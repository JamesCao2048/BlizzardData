Cocoa: Cmd-A to select all doesn't work in initial "Select a workspace" dialog
Build ID: I20081211-1908
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Install Eclipse Cocoa version
2.Launch
3.When the "Select a workspace" dialog comes up, if the entire text is selected, click somewhere so there is just an insertion point
4.Type Cmd-A to try to select all the text in the edit box
Actual result:
Beep, and selection doesn't change
Expected result:
No beep, and the entire contents of the edit box are selected
