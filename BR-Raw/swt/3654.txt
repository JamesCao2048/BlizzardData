Up and Down keys not always work for Combo
It occurs only on GTK.
After creating a read only combo, and add to it several
values, by pressing the up / down keys, the value of the combo changes.
This
works almost fine with two problems, the first value of the combo and the last
value of the combo.
When i reach to the first value and press the up key, the
focus is lost, and pressing either up or down key won't release me from this
state, only using the mouse will do the work here.
Same for the last value, but
with pressing the down key.
