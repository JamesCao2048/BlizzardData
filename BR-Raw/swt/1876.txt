Click "Yes" to switch to the plugin perspective.
3.Close the automatically opened plugin/manifest editor.
[N.B.
you need to be precise from here]
4.Right click the "Foo" project and select New->Target Definition.

6.Click the radio button "Include only plug-ins designated below"

More information:
This was found on Windows Vista Ultimate (running the Aero scheme).
It's important that the last few steps are done exactly as specified otherwise you may not reproduce it.
Workaround: close the editor and reopen; it doesn't appear to happen again during this eclipse session.
(Note though, that if you exit eclipse and restart, it will again exhibit this behaviour
- by opening the target editor and following steps 5 onwards.)
