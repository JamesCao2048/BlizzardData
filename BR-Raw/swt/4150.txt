Detection of CDE as active WM is platform-specific
SWT code currently determines the active desktop by looking for defined "atoms"
or properties that are associated with the root window.  The atom that Eclipse
now uses to identify CDE is DTWM_IS_RUNNING.  This happens in
Program.getDesktop().
CDE on AIX does not define this property.  It would be nice to have a string
that AIX, HP-UX, and Solaris have in common.  Kevin Cornell and I have discussed
using _DT_SM_PREFERENCES. which appears to be a defined property for all three
platforms.
