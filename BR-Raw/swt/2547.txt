virtual tree returns null item in multi-selection from different branches
Using build I20060125-0800.
Debug simple following test case with "one two three" as program arguments:
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int[] values = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
for (int i=0; i<values.length; i++) {
System.out.println("value="+values[i]);
}
}
}
after having put a breakpoint on for...
line.
In Variables view expand both local variables args and values.
Select first item in args array and one item in values array.
Look at displayed values in details pane:
one
<unknown>
In fact as soon as you select one of the arrays item, you have an
<unknown> which appears in detail pane if you select an item in the other array...
