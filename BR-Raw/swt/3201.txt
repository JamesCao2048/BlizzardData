Program integration with KDE
The Program class provided with Eclipse/GTK uses GNOME bindings to retrieve
programs associated with a particular file extension.
Now, given that:
* there is no publicly available QT port;
* many people like me use KDE and don't even have GNOME installed

it would be nice it at least the Program class would be able to inspect and
use the KDE bindinds when looking for applications, should the current
environment be KDE.
I guess this is possible without linking the KDE libraries,
and by parsing the KDE configuration files instead...
