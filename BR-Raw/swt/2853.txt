Tables don't repaint
3.1 M7, GTK+ 2.6.4, KDE 3.3.2, X.org 6.8.2, Linux 2.6.11
If a table becomes obscured, it may not repaint properly when it becomes visible
again.
STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
------------------
1.) Open the keys preference page
2.) Move the dialog off the screen.
3.) Move back on the screen.
With these steps, the table headers will sometimes not appear, or only paint
partially.
If the table is enabled, moving the mouse over a table column header
will cause that table column header to repaint.
If the table is disabled, the
table headers will remain unpainted or partially painted.
