OpenJDK crash log
The SWT example snippet Snippet282 crashes on my machine. I open a png image file and "copy" it. When I try to paste into an external application the snippet process crashes.
I'm on Ubuntu 8.04 64-bit. I'll attach the crash logs from OpenJDK and Sun Java 6 VM. They contain all the library versions.
I have tried to paste into GIMP, Inkscape and OpenOffice.
