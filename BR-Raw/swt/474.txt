[GTK/Linux] Validation error dialog from launch configuration cannot be clicked on
Build ID: I20071120-0800
1. Open an 'Eclipse Application' launch configuration.
2. Unselect some plug-ins that are needed to launch what you are going to launch.
3. Click on 'Validate Plug-ins'.
4. Notice that the popped up dialog will not capture mouse click events. You cannot expand the tree, you cannot click the 'OK' button.
5. To get rid of it, you need to alt+tab to the 'Run' dialog, then press the ESC key to close them.
This is on Linux/GTK+. I am on Gentoo Linux running gtk+ version 2.10.14.
I cannot reproduce this on 3.3.1.1. Benny has reproduced this on 1108's N build but could not reproduce it on 1018's or 1024's.
