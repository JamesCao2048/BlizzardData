emulated coolbar height is wrong when it has multi rows of different size
Version: 3.5.0
Build id: I20080930-0921
run the new TextEditor example
drag the coolitems one on its own row
Notice the bottom of the last row is clipped off
This happens cause layoutItems() and computeSize() are not following the same rules for row height.
This happen on all platforms but windows
