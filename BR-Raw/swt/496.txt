Backspace key, delete key and tab stop working when my application is minimized
I have a swt form.
I a swt browser control displaying a silverlight application.
I have focus in a textbox.
I minimize the swt form.
I maximize the swt form.
My textbox in the silverlight application still has focus.
I can type letters.
Backspace no longer works.
I hit delete and focus is set to a tabstrip control on my swt form instead of the next textbox.
Please feel free to contact us with what additional information is needed.
