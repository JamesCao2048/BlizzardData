[Browser] Registering a function has no effect on newly opened window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2
Build Identifier: 3.6M1
Functions registered on a new browser instance (set in an OpenWindowListener) cannot be called.
Navigating seems to re-register the function but without any navigation, calling the function on the loaded page does not work.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a link using the native context menu of IE.
2. In the open window listener, set the browser instance to use on which we add a custom function.
3. Triggering that function has no effect.
