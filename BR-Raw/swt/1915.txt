StyledText.getLocationAtOffset is slow for long lines was: Long lines take too long to display when "Show Whitespace Characters" is enabled.
Build ID: I20070625-1500
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Enable the "Show Whitespace Characters" feature.
2.Open a file containing a long line of data (>100 kB works well) in a text-based editor (text editor, or XML editor in Source mode).
3.Observe that Eclipse becomes unresponsive for 30+ seconds with 100% CPU utilization in Eclipse.exe.
Turning off the "Show Whitespace Characters" feature reduces this to about
< 3 seconds.
