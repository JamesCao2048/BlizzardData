Problems with read-only text boxes on Linux
I have some UI in the WTP project where I am attempting to follow the Eclipse accessibility guidelines by turning free-standing labels into border-less read-only text boxes so that screen readers can get at them.
The text boxes are located in a tab panel. This works fine on WinXP and Vista. The text box background is truly transparent. On WinXP the gradient on the tab panel comes through correctly. However, on Linux the text box background is white while tab panel is gray. I tried setting the text box background explicitly to SWT.COLOR_WIDGET_BACKGROUND, which makes the UI render correctly on Linux (at least in my setup), but of course breaks WinXP.
Is this a bug in SWT Linux implementation? If not, is my only option to include OS-specific code branches in my UI code?
