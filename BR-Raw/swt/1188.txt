code inconsistency in Spinner
in setMinimum, setMaximum, setDigits we have calls to:
textFormatter.setMinimum(NSNumber.numberWithInt(value));
textFormatter.setMaximum(NSNumber.numberWithInt(value));
textFormatter.setMaximumFractionDigits(digits);
when the values are set with Spinner#setValues() these natives methods are never called.
checking history they were added by skovatch with this description:
222791, 222795
- Added key filtering to the text field, and a number formatter to aid in presentation.
Scott, add the calls to setValues were remove them from the other places.
Please check if they are really necessary.
thanks.
