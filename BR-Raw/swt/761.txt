org.eclipse.swt.dnd.DragSourceListener javadoc references bogus "operation" field
Build Identifier: I20091210-2100
Several of the javadocs for org.eclipse.swt.dnd.DragSourceListener reference a non-existant "operation" field.
Specifically these are:
* dragEnter()
* dragOperationChanged()
* dragOver()
For example, dragOver has:
*
<p>The
<code>operation</code> value is determined by the value assigned to
*
<code>currentDataType</code> in previous dragEnter and dragOver calls.</p>

But there is no "operation" field, and even if it is "detail", the rest doesn't makes sense anyways.
I think these are results of copy-n-paste errors.
I'm pretty sure these errors are still in the source, since the source file in the repository [*] hasn't changed for 6 months since R3.5.
