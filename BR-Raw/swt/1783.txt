Annoying Message Box "prohibit running ActiveX controls" appear in browser when accessing page with applet
Build ID: I20070625-1500
Steps To Reproduce:
This bug is caused by the workaround implemented for bug id 59506.
To reproduce; use the SWT/Eclipse browser to access a page that contains an applet.
More information:
The ShowMessage method in WebSite.java attempts to resolve this problem however it is not working on my version of IE7.  This is because lpstrText contains the following value;
"One or more ActiveX controls could not be displayed because either:
1) Your current security settings prohibit running ActiveX controls on this page, or
2) You have blocked a publisher of one of the controls.
As a result, the page may not display correctly."
and the string loaded from SHDOCLC.DLL contains the following text;
"Your current security settings prohibit running ActiveX controls on this page.  As a result, the page may not display correctly."
These strings are not equal therefore this annoying message box is always displayed.
