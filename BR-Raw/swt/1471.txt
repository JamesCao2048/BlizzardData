SWT.getPlatform() should list all valid values
3.4.
Currently SWT.getPlatform() only gives examples of possible values. As a client I should know all possible values.
Look for example at  bug 242742  which suggests to add a check for "cocoa" but I have no clue that such a value is indeed valid or that it even existed.
