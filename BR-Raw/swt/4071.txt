False "unsaved changes" notification from launch configs
Build 20020602 (F2)
I still get false "You have unsaved changes" notifications from Java
Application configs periodically. I haven't been able to create a reproducible
test case. However, it should be simple to go through the code and spot any
lingering occurances of this persisting bug.
