NPE when debugging as java application
M3 build
- in the java perspective create the following class:
public class PrintNumbers {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(1);
System.out.println(2);
}
}
- drop down the Debug tool item, Debug As -> Java Application
- the program is run fine, but the perspective does not change to Java, and the
attached NPE is dumped
