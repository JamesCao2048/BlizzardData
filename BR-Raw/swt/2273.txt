CCombo computeSize needs to max item width with text width
The following few lines of code create a CCombo that has too small a preferred
size to display all of the text:
cCombo = new CCombo(shell, SWT.BORDER);
for (int i = 0; i
< 5; i++) {
cCombo.add("item" + i);
}
cCombo.setText("CCombo");
This is because the string "CCombo" is wider than "item0", "item1", etc.
I believe the preferred width calculation needs to take the max width of the
text (if set) and the items (if set).
