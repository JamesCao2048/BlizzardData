Font loading slow for font that is not there (ie. 'Sans Serif')
I have an application that renders a BIRT chart in a Canvas with real-time data.  When I run the application on Carbon, all is well.  When I run the application on Cocoa, the application grinds to a halt.  I'm attaching screen shots of the cpu activity when running the application.  The only difference is that I've changed the launch configuration arguments from -ws cocoa to -ws carbon.
I'm not able to make my code available publicly, but can make it available to any of the IBM SWT developers.
