Multi-line Text.setSelection(int) needs to reveal the selection
Build id: I20090511-2000 on Cocoa
Run Snippet11, which creates a multi-line text, appends a bunch of lines, and then calls setSelection(30). On other platforms, the Text is scrolled to show the new selection. On Cocoa, the Text remains scrolled to the end, where it was after appending the lines.
