Summary : Thai: Java Editor can not display u0e33 (Thai character SARA UM)
Description:
When I enter u0e33 (Thai character SARA UM) to Java editor or Text editor in
Eclipse, all characters in the same line are disappeared. The editor shows only a
square character at that line.
Note: This problem has not been found in Eclipse 2.02
Steps to create the problem
1) Create new text file or java file.
2) Copy the following Thai text (8 lines) to clipboard.

3) Paste the text to Eclipse's Java editor.
4) The problem is that the line #7 that includes u0e33 (Thai character SARA UM)
are displayed as one square character.
