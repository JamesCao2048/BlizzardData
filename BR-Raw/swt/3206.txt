[Browser] SWTException when resizing CTab containing Browser
Hi,
I am getting feedback from RSSOwl users on Mac that see a "SWTException: Widget
is disposed" when a CTabItem laying in a CTabFolder is resized.
I tracked this
problem down to line 192 in Browser.java.
Whenever the Event SWT.RESIZE is
triggered, a call to "isVisible()" is made.
In there the normal checkWidget()
call results in the Exception.
On any other OS, no exception is thrown.
The interesting part is, that I am not disposing the browser unless the
CTabItem was closed.
But this exception occurs (sometimes, not in every case)
when a Browser Tab is visible and resized.
It's even sufficient to resize the
entire application (since that fires SWT.RESIZE to the Browser too).
Is this a known issue?
I think it will be difficult for me to post a code
snippet, since I am not really knowing what this is about.
I am going to ask my
users for more details.
Ben
