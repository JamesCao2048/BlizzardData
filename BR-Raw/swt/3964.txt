StyledText - Change selection color when changing background color
It's great to see that it is now possible to change background color in
Eclipse! I prefer to use a dark blue backgrund, since I find it more
comfortable to the eye, and easier to read.
However, it is at the moment _not_ possible to change the selection color in
Eclipse, which defaults to - you've guessed it - dark blue, rendering the
possibility to set the background color completely useless to me.
The best solution would probably be to let the user choose the selection color,
but at least Eclipse should choose a selection color that is distinguishable
from the user selected background color.
