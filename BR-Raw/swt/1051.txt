Context menus outdated on right-click because MenuDetect fires before Selection event
HEAD (Cocoa)
Context menus in Eclipse (e.g.
in the Package Explorer) are outdated when I right-click on an item that has not been selected before.
The bug is that the MenuDetect event is fired before the Selection event, see e.g.
the ControlExample.
Fails for Table, Tree, List (though the List widget on WinXP does not change the selection on right-click).
Expected:             Cocoa:
----------
----------
MenuDetect
MouseDown             MouseDown
Selection             Selection
MenuDetect
MouseUp               MouseUp
