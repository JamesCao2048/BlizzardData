StyledText - exception when selecting lines in WRAP mode
build 20030528
-run the attached test case
-place the cursor at or near the end of the line
-resize the shell so that the height is less
-without changing the cursor location drag select in the widget
->you get an IllegalArgumentException in WrappedContent.getOffsetAtLine.
Also,
there is strange rendering behavior.
After the resize the content is wrapped.
This is caused by the fix to  bug 20377 .
