[Printer] Printer.dispose() after cancelJob() yields lifetime supply of GLib-CRITICAL
Created  attachment 84975   [details]
Snippet demonstrating bug
Build ID: I20071101-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Run the attached snippet on Linux x86_64 (may also occur on x86)
2.Select a printer and confirm print dialog
3.Bask in the warm glow of GLib-CRITICAL **: g_io_channel_write_chars: assertion `channel->is_writeable' failed
Specifically, GTK pukes when this line of Printer.destroy() executes:
if (printJob != 0) OS.g_object_unref (printJob);
This is probably due to cancelJob() not being properly implemented at present, however in the meantime SWT should degrade gracefully if possible.
The alternative is to call endJob(), which spits out a blank page even if I haven't called startPage().
