[RC2] Single-click in popups dismisses them (was: Quick Fix trouble)
Today I started using RC2, and since then there were a number of occasions in which
quick fix didn't work. I could click on the bulb in the margin, the quick fix suggestions
came up, but when I selected one nothing happened. I could do that repeatably. In one
occasion, after saving the source file and retrying, it did work as it should. I didn't find a
regularity in this yet.
