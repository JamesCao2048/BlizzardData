Application menu does not share application name
When self hosting, the application menu in Eclipse reads "java".  This SHOULD be a simple fix - I'll attach a patch that looks like it should work.  But it doesn't.  It doesn't work in Cocoa either so there may be some magic required to update the main menu that I'm not aware of... I cant update the name of anything that is currently visible.  For instance, a simple app with an app delegate that looks like this also fails:
#import "AppDelegate.h"
@implementation AppDelegate
-(void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification*)aNotification {
NSMenu *menu = [[NSApplication sharedApplication] mainMenu];
NSMenuItem *appMenuItem = [menu itemAtIndex: 0];
NSString *original = [item title];
NSLog(@"old title = %@", original);
[item setTitle: @"Wuggu?"];
NSString *newTitle = [item title];
NSLog(@"new title = %@", newTitle);
}
@end
the title method on the item does return the new value but the menu is still rendered with the old title.
