Text.setText() triggers two ModifyEvents
I see this behaviour in Eclipse-GTK I20030916. The relevent lines of code in
setText(String) are:
OS.gtk_editable_delete_text (handle, 0,
-1);
int [] position = new int [1];
OS.gtk_editable_insert_text (handle, buffer, buffer.length, position);
The delete text method triggers a ModifyEvent.
However, if you are listening
for modify events, then the actual new text won't be set yet.
For an example,
see  Bug 43168 .
This is different than I'd expect and different than how Windows XP SWT works.
On win32, the modify event is only sent after the internal state has been
updated fully.
Is this a limitation of GTK, or an implementation problem with SWT?
