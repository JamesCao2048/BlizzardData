[Widgets] [preferences] Export from 'Formatter' preference page should add file extension
I20090803-1800
Exporting formatter/cleanup settings from the settings page doesn't add the xml file extension to the file.
* open formatter page
* have at least one custom formatter
* click export all
* enter "test" as filename
You end up with a file called "test" instead of "test.xml"
