Text with SWT.SEARCH doesn't work with east asian language pack
Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20070323-1616
While playing around with the SEARCH style i found that it didn't work at all when the windows East Asian language pack was installed.

This is a windows bug and it has been fixed in Vista, but there is currently no way for calling code to detect that the style bit is being ignored.
Would it be possible to detect that the language pack is installed and unset the SEARCH style bit?
It already seems to be doing this if it detect the OS is less than XP.
