StyledText should render tabs exactly 4 spaces wide
I20060223-1656
StyledText should render tabs exactly 4 spaces wide. In latest builds, indents of 4 spaces don't align with indents of 1 tab in some fonts (e.g. Lucida Console Regular 8). See screenshot.
This works as expected in 3.1.2 as well as in notepad.
