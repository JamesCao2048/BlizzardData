Tracker cannot draw rectangle on main menu bar or dock
Build Identifier: 3.7.2.v3740f-RCP20120529-1500
I use Tracker in a screen shot application to draw the hinting rectangle.
The lines are only visible on regular screen area, but not main menu bar nor dock.
It looks like lines are covered by these special windows.
I checked the source code of cocoa version Tracker.
I found it creates a NSWindow and draws rectangle on it.
This should be window level related.
A normal level Tracker window is not sufficient in this case.
In comparison, carbon version Tracker has no such issue.
