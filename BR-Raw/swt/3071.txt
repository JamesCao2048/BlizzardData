[browser] Default WindowEvent to handle normal window open case - feature request
In the documenation for WindowEvent is about 50-lines of code that is noted as
this is the way "..are typically handled". This makes an HTML link that opens
another window such as &lt;a href="...url.." target="_blank"&gt; work. Since
this is the typical use (as stated in the docs), why not make this the default
behavior? It's a lot of code to get in and get right.
What I actually want is for the browser to handle _blank target by opening the
system browser, as it would if I loaded the HTML into IE, not to open another
SWT browser. I was not able to get this to work.
