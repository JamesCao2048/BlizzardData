addSelectionListener(SelectionListener) of Button, MenuItem, and ToolItem should tell about RADIO
HEAD
The Javadoc of the addSelectionListener(SelectionListener) method in
Button, MenuItem, and ToolItem should tell about the special behavior when the widget has the SWT.RADIO style.
In that case, widgetSelected(..) is not only called when the control is selected by the user, but also when the radio control loses selection.
There are already a number of WONTFIX and WORKSFORME bugs about this problem, but the right fix is to document the current behavior.
