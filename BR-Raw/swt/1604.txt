ACC: SWT does not give focus to a context menu from a dialog
Created  attachment 97453   [details]
SWT snippet that reproduces the problem
I create a context menu in a dialog and call setVisible(true);  It shows up, but keyboard focus remains within the dialog (arrow keys do not arm the menu items).
This works on windows.
1) Start up the snippet
2) pop up the context menu
3) choose Cascade Item>SubItem 1
4) type 'm' to get the popup menu
Result: continued typing goes into the text widget, including arrow keys
Expected: using arrow keys would arm the menu items
