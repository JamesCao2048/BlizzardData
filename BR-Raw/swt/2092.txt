[Linux] SWT Deactivate event no longer fired when a Shell is deactivated
This is blocking TPTP's Automated GUI Recorder form recording on Shells in Linux.
Eclipse SDK Build ID: I20070323-1616
Please see attached test case.
To reproduce:
1) Import this plugin into Eclipse
2) Launch an eclipse application (to show example test case)
3) Select the Run Test Case Menu > Run Example option
4) You will see an empty shell.
5) The way this works is the SWT Activate and Deactivate events and their corresponding widgets will be printed to the console in your primary workbench.
6) Select File > New> Project and notice the activate events produced by the shell.
Now switch back to the open shell.
No Deactivate event is fired from the {New Project}shell.
7) Repeat the above with SDK build ID: I20070209-1006 and notice that Deactivate events are fired.
