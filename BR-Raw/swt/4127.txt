EmulatedWidgetTests fail on Linux
build 20020426
There are a number of unexpected errors and failures when running
org.eclipse.swt.tests.junit.EmulatedWidgetTests.
One is related to Table.remove(int[]) and another to TableItem.getImageBounds
(). The rest are in inherited tests of Widget and Control.
I did not try running AllTests.
