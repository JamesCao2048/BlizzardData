Tooltip on Link shows href
I20101025-1800 Cocoa
When you hover over a link in the Link widget, a tooltip shows the href (or redundantly the link text if there's no href).
I would not expect the tooltip, since it is also not shown on other platforms.
Such links usually contain an internal id as href, which shouldn't be shown to the user (e.g.
in Eclipse preference pages).
If the Link widget ever supports tooltips per link, then they should be configurable ( bug 88866 ).
