[Image loading] ImageLoader and Image from stream fail with certain animated gifs
Attached you'll find a project which demonstrates an SWT for an image which opens perfectly in other image programs but fails on SWT.
There's only one image loading implementation which allows to load the image which is the purely native one new Image(Display,String) but because I need to show an animated give this doesn't help me a lot.
You'll have to adjust the path to the image for to make new Image(Display,String) work for you
