StyledText - bidi - should force font script when keyboard language changed
StyledText derives whether or not to reorder text based on what the font script
is (this is what MS doc says to do when using GetCharacterPlacement).
If you
have your font script set incorrectly (e.g., Western vs.
Hebrew/Arabic), RtoL
text will be displayed as LtoR, which is confusing.
Other applications (e.g.,
WordPad) set the font script when the keyboard language is changed.
We should
do this if we can.
