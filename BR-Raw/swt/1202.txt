[cocoa] Incorrect file paths when opening .html files in an external browser
I tried running this on carbon, and this is reproducible only on cocoa.
Steps:
0.Set default browser to use external browser (safari/webkit in my case)
1.Create a project
2.add a .html file in the project
3.Open the .html file using external browser, the generated URL that I see in the *external* browser is the file path appended with the eclipse binary path appended with the actual file path:
file:///Volumes/data/eclipse-installs/eclipse-3.5M5-cocoa/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/file:/private/tmp/e/foo/tests/org.eclipse.swtbot.generator.test/junit/html/index.html
