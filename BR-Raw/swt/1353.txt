StyledText strikeout over tab space
Build ID:  I20080917-0800
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Get SWT Text Editor from examples
2. enter few TAB spaces
3. select the TAB spaces
4. apply strikeout
notice that strikeout is not shown
if we apply underline, underline is shown over the tab spaces.
Shouldn't it be consistent?
More information:
if you first apply strikeout, then underline, the strikeout appears.
