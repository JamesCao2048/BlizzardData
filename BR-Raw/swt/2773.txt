Redundant check for the pointer coordinates
In Control#gtk_motion_notify, gdk_window_get_pointer() is used to get the
coordinates relative to the root window.
However, Control#sendMouseEvent maps
these back into widget-relative coordinates.
It would be more efficient and straightforward to simply request the mouse
position relative to the target window in the first place.
The attached patch
solves this.
