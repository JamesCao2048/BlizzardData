On Mac OS X Cocoa, setClipping(getClipping()) produces wrong behaviour under some transforms.
Created  attachment 138857   [details]
Java source which illustrates problem.
Build ID: 3.5M6
Steps To Reproduce:
On SWT, on Cocoa:
1.Set up a display Transform with negative, fractional translation
2.Get the current GC clip rectangle, with "oldClip = getClipping()"
3.(optionally) change the clipping, and draw other stuff.
(Other stuff draws okay.)
4.Attempt to restore clipping with "setClipping(oldClip)"
=> CLIP REGION GETS SCREWED UP
More information:
Note that changing the initial clip region (by resizing the window) causes the effect to change.
Java file attached which illustrates the problem.
Carbon does not exhibit the same problems, though it does have a clipping  bug 151670  which means that the attached Java program also produces wrong behaviour.
The Linux version (of 3.5M6) seems to produce correct output.
