File deleted by unexpected drag and drop
Here is a strange scenario in which a file is deleted when it is selected.
1) Open the Java Browsing Perspective
2) Open the Package Explorer and place it on the far right of the editor
3) In the Package Explorer, expand a project that is shared with CVS so a
shared file is visible
4) Edit this file and make a change
5) Team>Sychronize the file.
6) Make the Sync view a fast view such that the file from step 3 is visible in
the Package Explorer while the sync view is open
7) In the sync view, modify the file but DON'T save it.
8) Click on the file in the packages explorer. The sync view will lose focus
and the user is prompted to save the changes in the sync view.
9) Say No when asked to save the changes
10) File selected in step 8 is deleted
