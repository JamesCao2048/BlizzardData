Removing the last item from a read-only combo does not clear the selection
This problem happens on Linux-GTK, Linux-motif and Solaris-motif
I have a read-only combo on a dialog.
The combo is created in the following
way:
Combo combo = new Combo(composite, SWT.SINGLE | SWT.READ_ONLY | SWT.DROP_DOWN);
An action is related to the combo.
The action removes the currently selected
item from the combo.
When the user triggers that action, I call combo.remove
(int index) to remove the item.
If the item is the only item left, then after
it has been removed, the combo does not clear the selection.
I tried calling
combo.clearSelection() and combo.redraw(), but nothing worked.
The combo does
not get repainted.
The item which has been removed is still the current
selection.
