GP when asyncExec runs from DirectoryDialog modal loop (was Crash related to new Progress Viewer)
with I20040428, on windows XP. I'll attach "dump", but was just browsing PDE
preferences, when crash occurred. From the dump, it appears related to new
Progress Viewer, but ... since on OS.winproc, will pass by SWT first? Have just
seen once (after about 30 minutes of using new I-build).
