[DnD] [WorkbenchParts] Resizing tiled editors incorrectly sizes editor parts at start of drag
Steps to reproduce:
1.open 2 or more editors and tile them vertically
2.start dragging the separator between them to resize them
As you start the resize the top editor collapses to its minimum vertical size.
You can keep dragging to resize the editors but the mouse is now in the wrong place.
This also happens when resizing horizontally, the editor on the left collapses to its minimum horizontal
size.
Once you've finished the drag, you can no longer pick up the separator between the editors and resize
them again.
