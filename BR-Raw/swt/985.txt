[clipboard] regression: pasting text from file properties to java editor seems to be in wrong format
3.5RC1 test build I20090511-2000
- worked in 3.5M7
- possibly caused by the fix for  bug 252109  (?)
- open a java file
- modify its content in any way and save it to verify that saving a file is working as expected
- right-click the file in the Package Explorer
-> Properties
- many of the texts on this page are selectable, so select one (eg.- "File (Java Source File)") and press Cmd+C to copy it
- paste it into the java Editor with Cmd+V
- save the java editor's content

-> this now fails with error dialog: "...Some characters cannot be mapped using MacRoman character encoding..."
