Text widget VerifyListener causes characters to be inserted backwards if you change them
I have a small program with a Text widget whose VerifyListener actually replaces the characters being entered.
Newer 3.2 milestones on Linux cause it to go backwards.
Here is a piece of the code so you can see what I'm doing that's triggering this bug, and I'll attach the whole program.
thoughts.addVerifyListener(new VerifyListener() {
public void verifyText(VerifyEvent e) {
if (e.character == 'b')
e.doit = false;
else {
e.text = str.charAt(count.value() % str.length()) + "";
count.increment();}}});
