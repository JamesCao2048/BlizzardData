1.Open Window
-> Show View
-> Other ...
2.Expand Basic
3.Click on Performance
4.Click away from Performance
5.Click on Performance again
When Performance is selected it shows some icon (an icon not related to the
Performance View) and when it is not selected it has no icon.
I believe the
Performance view is not setting any image for this tree item.
