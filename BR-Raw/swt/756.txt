[widgets] gtk2.18 - Blank pages in the install wizard
Using I20091230-0802 (the latest build from the API branch), there are pages missing from the Install Wizard.
In particular, after I select something to install, hit next, the
- Install Details
- Review Licenses
are blank.
(Note: Finish is not enabled either because I cannot accept the license).
