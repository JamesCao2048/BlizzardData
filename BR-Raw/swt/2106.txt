Disposed TableEditor recieves resize event and crashes
TableEditor.ControlMoved is called for disposed editor.
It calls TableEditor._resize()(in the last version "_resize" is renamed to "layout").
void _resize () {
if (table.isDisposed()) return;
if (item == null || item.isDisposed()) return;
int columnCount = table.getColumnCount();
if (columnCount == 0 && column != 0) return;
if (columnCount > 0 && (column
< 0 || column >= columnCount)) return;
super._resize();
}
But table is null, so we have a crash.
If u look at TableEditor.dispose() code u see that sometimes removeControlListener is NOT removed for the disposed editor.
public void dispose () {
if (this.column >
-1 && this.column
< table.getColumnCount()){
TableColumn tableColumn = table.getColumn(this.column);
tableColumn.removeControlListener(columnListener);
}
columnListener = null;
table = null;
item = null;
column =
-1;

super.dispose();
}
This happens in our application.
I could not reproduce this in a separate snippet.
It happened when columns were added and removed from the table a lot, editors are disposed and a resize event is fired for the table for any reason.
I know for sure that this editor was disposed.
If u can not reproduce the problem, and can not prevent from _resize to be fired on disposed editor, at least move the line:
"if (item == null || item.isDisposed()) return;"
to be first in the _resize() method.
So, that it would not crash on table.isDisposed() line.
I attach a print screen with call stack of a problem.
Thanks
