Cannot tab out of Text with SWT.PASSWORD
HEAD (same in 3.5)
The Tab key (and combinations with Ctrl and Shift) don't work in a Text field with SWT.PASSWORD. They just select the whole field instead of traversing the focus to the next control.
Bug 28524  sounds like there's special code for this on Carbon.
