Control example coolbar tab uses images in drop down
In the coolbar tab of the ControlExample, enable Item styles "SWT.DROP_DOWN".
Now make the coolbar 100x100 so that a chevron is required to see some of the
items.
On WindowsNT, menus do not support images.
When you select the menu from the
chevron of the coolbar, it is blank because there are only images in the menu
items.
