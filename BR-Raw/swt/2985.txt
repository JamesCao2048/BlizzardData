SWT.RIGHT not working on Text control on Mac OS X
On Mac OS X 10.3 it is not possible to have right aligned text within a Text
control (AKA text field).
This works on Windows XP and Linux GTK, however, I
don't know anything about Carbon, so this might just be unsupported.
Here's a small snippet showing the problem:
public static void main(String[] args) {
Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
Text text = new Text(shell, SWT.SINGLE | SWT.BORDER | SWT.RIGHT);
text.setBounds(10, 10, 200, 25);
text.setText("right aligned?");
shell.setBounds(50, 50, 230, 100);
shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch())
display.sleep();
}
display.dispose();
}
I'm sorry if this is a dup, couldn't find a bug.
Tested with Eclipse 3.1M6.
