Printing does NOT work on Mac
Build ID: I20080530-1730
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open a file with Text Editor
2. Select print from the toolbar

Notice, that it doesn't print.  The failure is in Print.java on line 367.  It throws a NullPointer exception.  The logic seems flawed because this method is trying to set the defaultFont.  What's strange is the systemFont is null, yet the way you get the systemFont is to call getSystemFont().  But, this method will return the defaultFont, which is the very thing we're trying to set originally.
