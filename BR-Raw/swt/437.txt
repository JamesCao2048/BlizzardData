[Custom Widgets] CCombo setFocus does not work
Build Identifier: M20100211-1343
When trying to set initial focus on a CCombo during creation of cotrols, it does not work.
The reason is IMHO that it does not override forceFocus() method, which is used when restoring saved focus from shell.
Reproducible: Always
