JVM dump in SWT native method
I had eclipse-SDK-N20051006-0010-linux-gtk.tar.gz running on gtk2-2.4.13-14 in
gnome-desktop-2.8.0-3
I had done some compiles and cleans, fixed some errors, closed all editors in
the java perspective, and then I did CTRL+SHIFT+T and it cored.
I'll attached the stack trace.
