CTabFolder should hide tabs in LRU order
If CTabFolder does not have enough space to render all of its tabs, it should
display the N most recently used tabs rather than the tabs immediately adjacent
to the selected tab.
This should not affect the relative ordering of tabs.
For example:
CTabItem item0 = new CTabItem(folder, SWT.NONE, 0);
CTabItem item1 = new CTabItem(folder, SWT.NONE, 1);
CTabItem item2 = new CTabItem(folder, SWT.NONE, 2);
In this case, item0 should always be to the left of item2 whenever both are
displayed at the same time.
If item1 is the least recently used tab, then item0
should appear immediately adjacent to item2 whenever there is only space for two
tabs.
