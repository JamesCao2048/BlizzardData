Copy not working.
When pressing CTRL+C or selecting "Edit->Copy" from the menu, the copy buffer is
not filled. This happens most of the time altough occasionaly the buffer is
filled (maybe one out of 100 times). If I copy some text from another
application and paste into Eclipse the text is pasted as expected.
