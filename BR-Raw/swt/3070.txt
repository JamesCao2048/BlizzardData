resizing TreeColumn leaves cheese
- run the ControlExample, go to the Tree tab
- turn on the Multiple Columns, Header Visible and Lines Visible checkboxes
- in the first example Tree on the page, resize the Name column by dragging its
right column line to span most of the available tree width (ie.- to roughly
where the Modified column ends by default)
- resize the Name column back to its original size, and the table contents will
not redraw properly, as shown in the attached image
