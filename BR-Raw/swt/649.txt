[Accessibility] VoiceOver doesn't read the title of tabs in a tab group
I20100429-1549
VoiceOver isn't reading the title of a tab.
1. Launch ControlExample
2. Turn on VoiceOver.
3. Click on a tab
You hear "selected tab xx of 25" but the title isn't announced. Compare with System Preferences -> Keyboard (for example), where the name of the tab is announced when you click on it.
This is a standard control so we shouldn't be overriding anything.
