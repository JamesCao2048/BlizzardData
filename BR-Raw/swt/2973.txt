Do not understand Javadoc of Link.setText()
3.1 M5a
Javadoc of Link.setText says:
* anchor, a single HREF attribute is supported.  When a hyperlink is
* selected, the text field of the selection event contains either the
* text of hyperlink or the value of the HREF, if one was specified.
I could not find a field or other way to access the text field of the selection
event.
Q: If I have > 1 link, how do I know in the selection event which one has been
clicked?
