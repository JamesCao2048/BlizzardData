PocketPC and eSWT example problems
v3039
Run the attached examples.
ExampleLauncher is the main class.
These are the
examples that are shipped with eSWT.
The examples were derived from the SWT
ControlExample.

1. Run ButtonExample.
Push Buttons are always flat.
Does the PPC support
beveled buttons?
2. Run CanvasExample.
Check the NO_BACKGROUND style.
Notice that a scrollbar
appears in the wrong place.
Uncheck the NO_BACKGROUND style.
Check the
NO_FOCUS style.
You can see a stray vertical scrollbar flashing on the screen.
3. Run the ComboExample.
Check the READ_ONLY style.
You can see the combo
flash up in the left hand corner of the screen.
Select the SIMPLE style.
The
combo "acts" like it is a SIMPLE combo as seen on Windows 2K (it is placed
based on a larger vertical height), but it's still just the DROP_DOWN style.

Does PPC support the SIMPLE style?
4. Run the LabelExample.
Check SEPARATOR.
The separator is barely visible.

Click HORIZONTAL and it goes away all together.
Try to set the size (via the
size menu), you still can't get the separator to appear.
Also, I take it that
the shadow styles are not supported on PPC?
5. Run the SliderExample.
Try to drag the thumb to the right.
The thumb
jumps all the way to the left.
6. Run the TextExample.
Check WRAP or READ_ONLY.
You see a stray scrollbar
flashing toward the top of the screen.
