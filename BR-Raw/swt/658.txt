QI shouldn't return S_OK for IAText if there are only attributeListeners
Created  attachment 166723   [details]
Only support IAccessibleText if there are accessibleTextListeners
Run org.eclipse.swt.examples.accessibility.LiveRegionExample.
Run AccProbe, and look at the Label at the top of the shell.
This Label implements an accessibleAttributeListener so that it can return object attributes.
The code for QI currently returns S_OK for IAccessibleText. This Label is just a plain Label - it is not an IAccessibleText (or even a ROLE_TEXT) so it returns all sorts of bogus information when AccProbe sends any of the text methods to the IAccessibleText interface.
The fix is to only answer S_OK for IAccessibleText if there are accessibleTextListeners. It doesn't make sense for an application to return text attributes without also implementing accessibleTextListener.
