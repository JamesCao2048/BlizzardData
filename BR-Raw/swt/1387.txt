More information:
This issue occurs on windows XP and Vista.
Untested on other platforms.
This issue also occurs for instances of the SWT Browser widget, NOT just the browser view used in eclipse to view html files.
It's possible to type 眉
It's possible to cut and paste the letters in
It's possible to enter it using keyboard code (Alt + 154)
I tested the same file with Firefox and Internet Explorer without any problems
I'm happy to provide further information and perform further tests if required
