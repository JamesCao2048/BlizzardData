In PerspectiveSwitcher, we are attempting to manipulate the layout of a ToolBar
that is positioned in a Shell that is not yet open.  When we ask for the bounds
of the ToolBar, we get expected values.  However, when we ask for the bounds of
one of its items, we get {-1,-1,1,1}.

Working with Steve Northover, we tried a simple fix of forcing the parent to
relayout.  This solved this immediate problem, but seemed to cause problems for
other pieces of UI code.
