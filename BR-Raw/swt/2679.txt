DirectoryDialog and FileDialog bring CPU utilization to 100%
It seems that this fix for 76195 creates problems is Eclipse 3.1. When I open
DierectoryDialog and there are pending asyncExecs the dialog keeps receiving
WM_ENTERIDLE events and that brings the CPU utilization to 100%. That makes the
DiarctoryDialog node expanding extremely slow, almost impossible to use.
