Widget in outliner gets wrapped/cropped
Build 20020602 (F2)
Linux-GTK
1.Open the outliner.
2.Close all editors.
The tree widget is replaced with a text widget (note: I'm
not sure about exactly which widgets are used) that says: "An outline is not
available"
3.Shrink the outliner such that the text cannot be fit on a single line.
4.On Win32, the text does not wrap, but instead gets truncated.
On Linux-GTK,
the text wraps, but the top and bottom of the letters get cut off.
It appears
that the containing widget isn't growing.
