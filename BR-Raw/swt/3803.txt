[Cell Editors] Can not see what value I am typing in the Properties
The "Value" field in property sheets does not scroll properly when entering a
value longer than the column size.  It does scroll but it's behind, e.g. if I
type "org.eclipse.longtestcase.abcd", after I type "d" it may only scroll up
to "a" - so I don't see what I am typing.
This happens on WinXP, but on GTK it scrolls correctly.
