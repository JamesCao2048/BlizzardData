Selection by mouse drag is out of kilter
Running on MacOSX 10.2.3
Using eclipse-SDK-I20030129-macosx-carbon.zip
Create a new plugin, say one of the defaults.
Then attempt to edit the file plugin.xml by selection lines with the mouse.
Have fun as the selection area goes out of alignment with the mouse position.
