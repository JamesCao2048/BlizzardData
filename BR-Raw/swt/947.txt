Scrollbar incorrectly fires selection events
Build RC3
I have a tree in which I'm listing to the vertical scroll bar selection events.
If the tree contains a horizontal scroll bar, but no vertical scroll bar and you use the mouse wheel to scroll in the vertical direction, you get selection events on the vertical scroll bar.
If the tree contains no scroll bars, scrolling with the mouse wheel does not fire events as expected.
