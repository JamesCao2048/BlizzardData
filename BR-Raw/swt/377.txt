Parent shell wrongly focused via Expos茅 (should activate primary modal child shell)
HEAD Cocoa
- Open a child shell with PRIMARY_MODAL (e.g.
in ControlExample)
- Via Expos茅, select the parent shell
=> Parent shell gets activated, but keyboard interaction doesn't work
=> Expected: Child shell should be active
I would also expect that the child shell is shown as a separate window in Expos茅, at least if it's MODELESS.
Works fine with the native Open dialog.
Works fine on Carbon (separate window in Expos茅, parent passes focus to child when activated).
