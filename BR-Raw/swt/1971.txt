Snippet132 using drawString incorrectly
Snippet132 has the following code at the "business end:"
String testString = "Hello World!";
Point extent = gc.stringExtent(testString);
gc.drawString(testString, leftMargin, topMargin + font.getFontData()[0].getHeight());
I'm not sure why we're adding font.getFontData()[0].getHeight() and I believe it should be removed.  drawString()'s x and y parameters are measured in pixels, but FontData.getHeight() is a measure of the font face's height in points.
On my printer there is no appreciable difference on the printout, since the printer DPI is 600 and the FontData.getHeight() returns 2 (not sure why) which amounts to only 1/300" == 0.085mm difference.  However in working with the SWTSwing folks, where printing is always 72DPI (ugh) the error in this snippet is more obvious.  An 8-point font will be drawn at an 8-point offset (about 1/8" == 2.82mm).  This makes SWTSwing's behavior appear to be wrong when in fact it is the snippet.
