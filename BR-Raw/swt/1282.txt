Builds: Eclipse SDK Mac OSX Cocoa N20081120-2000 (compared to Carbon N20081120-2000)
In the context of the SWT Controls Example, re the Label control:
Setting Alignment (to Left, Center, or Right) has no effect on Text labels (with or without Wrap style selected). (By contrast, Image labels are aligned as specified).
