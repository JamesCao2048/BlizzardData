[OSX] Printer instance unusable after cancelJob()
A Printer is unusable on OSX after calling cancelJob().  It can be used over and over with startJob()/endJob(), but not after startJob()/cancelJob().
This behavior increases the difficulty of working around  bug 179201 .
I will attach a test case that demonstrates this problem on OSX.
