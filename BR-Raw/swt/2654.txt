Antialiasing causes incorrect drawing
Using Cairo 1.0 and SWT 3.2M2, antialiasing causes incorrect drawing in some
situations.
It appears things are drawn when moving the raster when it should
not actually be in a draw operation.
The attached image and code describe this
better than I could here in words.
