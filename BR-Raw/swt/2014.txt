Enabling owner draw removes horizontal scrollbar
I20070516-0010.
1.start fresh workspace
2.create a Java project with very long name (==> scroll bar)
3.enable colored labels
==> horizontal scroll bar gone
NOTE: resizing fixes the problem BUT: in M7 this did not work and not even closing and reopening the Package Explorer helped.
