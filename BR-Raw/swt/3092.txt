EC: need api to query for Tray support
Maybe something like Tray.isPresent() ?  The motivation for wanting to know
this, as opposed to just blindly using it, is pasted below.
"
if you want to close all windows and have your program run in the
background with only a tray item to show status information and to
(re-)open the main window, you need to be sure that the tray item is
really displayed, or you risk leaving your application running without
any means to control it.
