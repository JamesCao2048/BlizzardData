Scrollbars should be disabled in ImageAnalyzer example
Build F2 (20020602)
Redhat 7.2, GTK2
KDE 2.2-10
(GTK2 only)
Open the ImageAnalyzer example.
Notice the scrollbars are enabled, and you can move them around, but they don't
have any effect. If you open a small image, like an icon, the scrollbars are
just misleading because they don't do anything.
