Shell.getAlpha() returns inconsistent values
The javadoc doesn't seem to mention it, but I am guessing that setAlpha was meant to take a value from 0 (transparent) to 255 (opaque) to be consistent across platforms.
On GTK and carbon getAlpha() returns an int from 0 to 255. On windows it returns a byte returned as an int, which can become negative.
In shell.getAlpha() there is
return pbAlpha [0];
I suggest:
return pbAlpha[0] & 0xFF;
Example code:
shell.setAlpha(254)
System.err.println(shell.getAlpha()); // currently returns
-2, should probably return 254 to be consistent.
