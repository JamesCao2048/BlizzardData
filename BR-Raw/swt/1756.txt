[Browser] execute("window.print()") not working
It seems that Browser.execute("window.print()") does not show the Print Dialog
when called out of an SWT application.
Typing "javascript:window.print()" into
Safari's URL Field however is working.
The user that reported this issue is running Safari 1.2.4.
