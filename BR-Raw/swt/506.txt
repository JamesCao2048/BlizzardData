SWT test failures on Windows 7
I've been running tests on a Windows 7 Hudson slave at the Eclipse foundation to test running the build on eclipse.org hardware.
There are a number of SWT failures and I was wondering if the SWT team could comment.
Here is the list of SWT tests
- there are 47 failures out of about 5600 tests

I'm not sure if these failures are expected on Windows 7 or if they are due to infrastructure issues on this new test machine.
thanks!
