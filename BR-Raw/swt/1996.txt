AIX 5.3 motif - Characters above u007f show as "iso8859" in some swt widgets
Build ID: I20070503-1400
Steps To Reproduce:
Download eclipse-SDK-3.3M7-aix-motif.zip
JVM = IBM 1.5 SR4 (pap32dev-20070201)
AIX env LANG=en_US
1.Cut and paste the following into a Java Class
public class TestString {
public static void main(String[] args) {
char ok = 'u007e';
char not_ok = 'u00c1';
System.out.println(ok);
System.out.println(not_ok);
}
}
2.Add a breakpoint on the first System.out and run in debug
3.Look at the 2 variables in the Variables View
>> ok should show a ~
>> not_ok  should show A accented
4.RMB on the first variable -> Change Value
>> Change Primitive Value dialog appears and is primed with the value of variable ok
5. do the same for the 2nd variable (not_ok) and you will see "iso8859-1" for the value.
>> this should be an A accent
It appears that any character above 'u007f' will show as "iso8859-1"
Any string that has one of these characters will cause the whole string to be replaced with "iso8859-1"
More information:
This appears to be related to the font but I can't say for sure.
In 3.2.2 this was worse because even the TreeItem in the Variables view will show "iso8859-1" if one or more characters > 0x7f was in the text of the TreeItem
NOTE: it is hard to say how many widgets are affected by this.  Since 3.2.2 some appear to be fixed. (JDT Variables view TreeItem seems to work in 3.3)
Without knowing the extent of the problem and the fact that complete strings fail and only show "iso8859" this has the potential to be a severe problem on the AIX platform.
