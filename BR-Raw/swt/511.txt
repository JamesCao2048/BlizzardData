GTK+ Printer getDPI returns 72 x 72
20060717
Printer.getDPI() currently returns a constant: 72 x 72.
This is even for printers that can print 300 x 300 or 600 x 600 DPI.
This may be the reason that fonts print large and lines print 'fat' on GTK+, but I needed to do this because when I return the correct DPI, 'pixel' coordinates passed to draw routines are not correct for printer. (And I do not want to change every draw routine in GC at this time).
There is some kind of 'resolution' problem that needs to be fixed. This is partly (but not completely) because of  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346245
Still need to figure out the problem here.
