Ampersands in tree column headers do not show on Windows
I had posted the following in the newsgroup:
I am trying to define a column header (org.eclipse.swt.widgets.TreeColumn)  for a tree-viewer (org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tree)
I want to label one column with a string that contains an '&' (ampersand):
----------------
...
col = new TreeColumn(tree, SWT.LEFT);
col.setText("event-type & number");
...
----------------
Apparently ampersands are filtered, at least they are not displayed at all.
I also tried '&&' but still no ampersand in the header.
How can I define a column header that DOES contain an ampersand?
Is there some "escape"?

This appears to be a platform behaviour on windows (tested on win2000),
because there's nothing in TableColumn.setText(...) that processes the
string's ampersands.
On gtk using && will put an ampersand in the title.
Please log a bug report with SWT about this difference (
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Platform  ).
There may
be nothing that can be done about this on windows, but I couldn't find a
previous report of this, so it should at least be investigated.
