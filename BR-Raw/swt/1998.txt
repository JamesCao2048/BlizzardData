[render] colored labels shifted to the right and margin smaller between icon and text
3.3 RC1.
When enabling colored labels the icon and the text get shifted to the right and the margin between icon and text becomes smaller.
The shifting is less bad than the small (almost inexistent) margin.
This does not happen in WindowsXP.
Should also check Mac.
