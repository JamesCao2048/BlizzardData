WebKit for GTK not detected.
Build Identifier: M20110210-1200
Eclipse should check for WebKit for GTK library as "libwebkitgtk.so" as well as current implementation checking as "libwebkit.so".
Recent changes in distribution of WebKit for GTK have changed the name of the library from libwebkit.so.* to libwebkitgtk.so.*
Notably, this has been seen in ArchLinux ( https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=46887 ).
This causes eclipse to be unable to use the WebKit internal browser, despite user preference.
User (with root privileges) may symbolically link libwebkitgtk.so.* to libwebkit.so as a workaround.
I am reporting this bug as "Normal" rather than "Minor" since eclipse crashes with xulrunner-2.0, which is now a final release.
Using WebKit may be the fastest fix for users of Firefox 4 and Gnome 3.0.1, and they will be further frustrated to find that also does not work.
Reproducible: Always
