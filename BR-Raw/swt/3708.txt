Bug in Decorations.setPlacement method
The setPlacement method in Decorations contains the following code:
if ((flags & OS.SWP_NOMOVE) == 0) {
lpwndpl.left = x;
lpwndpl.top = y;
}
if ((flags & OS.SWP_NOSIZE) == 0)
{
lpwndpl.right = x + width;
lpwndpl.bottom = x + height;
}
I believe this should be changed to:
if ((flags & OS.SWP_NOMOVE) == 0)
{
lpwndpl.left = x;
lpwndpl.top = y;
}
else
{
x = lpwndpl.left;
y = lpwndpl.top;
}
if ((flags & OS.SWP_NOSIZE) == 0)
{
lpwndpl.right = x + width;
lpwndpl.bottom = y + height;
}
The problem with the current code occurs when the 1st test is false (ie.
NO_MOVE is true) and the 2nd test is true (ie NOSIZE is false).
Consider what
happens if setPlacement is called with the values (0, 0, 400, 400), where the
current window placement is (50, 50, 500, 500).
The current code sets the
window placement to (50, 50, 400, 400), which violates the requested width and
height.
