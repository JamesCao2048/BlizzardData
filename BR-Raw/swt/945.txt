Trying to call a function during load, and showing that it works after load
Build ID: 3.5RC1
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Register a function to a browser.
2.Load some HTML content that invokes that function before it is fully loaded: the function call fails.
More information:
This bugs exists at least on Windows XP (IE and XULRunner) and Ubuntu (XULRunner).
When mixing various components, with JS callbacks and such, it is hard to tell whether the current state allows the Java function to be called.
This makes their use very dangerous for any serious integration.
For example, if you want some logging of the JS on the Java side, you could replace all alert() calls, but this would not work.
I originally wanted to switch to BrowserFunctions to replace my hackish window.location/window.status communication channel but I stumbled upon this showstopper.
If you could describe the exact conditions needed to call the function and if you happen to know of a way to call them at anytime using some prefix or whatever, please let me know.
