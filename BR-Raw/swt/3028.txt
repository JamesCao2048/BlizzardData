[SWT Examples - SWT Controls] Incorrect Dialog buttons creation with SWT.RETRY, SWT.ABORT, and SWT.IGNORE on MessageBox
When I was going through the Eclipse 3.1M5a examples (eclipse-examples-
3.1M5a.zip), on Solaris 9 (GTK), I realized that selecting SWT.RETRY,
SWT.ABORT, or SWT.IGNORE individually for MessageBox always create the OK
button on the dialog box.
Steps to reproduce:
1.Install Eclipse 3.1M5a on Solaris 9.
2.Download Eclipse 3.1M5a Examples and install them.
3.Launch Eclipse
4.Select 鈥淲indow
-> Show View
-> Other鈥︹.
This will launch the 鈥淪how View鈥
Dialog.
5.From the 鈥淪how View鈥 Dialog, select 鈥淪WT Examples
-> SWT Controls鈥.
This
will display 鈥淪WT Controls鈥 View.
6.Double click the SWT Controls tab and expand the view.
7.From SWT Controls View, select 鈥淒ialog鈥 tab.
and select the MessageBox.
8.Select either SWT.RETRY, SWT.ABORT, or SWT.IGNORE option and click
the "Create Dialog" button.
The "Title" dialog box comes up with an OK button.
It should have the button according to the SWT option (RETRY, ABORT, or IGNORE).
9.Select 2 options from SWT.RETRY, SWT.ABORT, or SWT.IGNORE.
Again, the dialog
box comes up with only 1 OK button.
In this case, I think 2 buttons should come
up.
10.Select all 3 options from SWT.RETRY, SWT.ABORT, and SWT.IGNORE.
The dialog
box comes up correctly with all 3 buttons (RETRY, ABORT, and IGNORE).
