Screenshots
Build ID: 3.4M2
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Run the same applications, which use menus, that have items with accelerators.
with LTR and RTL orientation.
2.Compare appearance of these menu items in different orientation.
Items are displayed differently.
More information:
Problem here is in using 't' as part of accelerator's text.
It is supposed, that some additional spaces will appear between text and accelerator
- but this doesn't work for RTL orientation.
