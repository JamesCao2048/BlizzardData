Label not wrapping
The label does not wrap correctly as I resize the shell.
public static void main(String[] args) {
Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
Label label = new Label(shell, SWT.WRAP);
label.setText("A clap of thunder burst the numbness deep Within my head, " +
"making me Start like someone roused by force from sleep.
" +
"On my feet, I strained intently to see This way and that, seeking " +
"Clues as to where I might be.
At last I saw that I was hovering " +
"On the brink of that abyss of despair Which funnels thunder from " +
"endless wailing.
So dark and deep was that valley, and the air " +
"So misty, that when I looked below Nothing showed itself, " +
"as much as I might stare.");
shell.setSize(400, 400);
shell.open();
while(!shell.isDisposed()) {
if(!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
}
display.dispose();
}
