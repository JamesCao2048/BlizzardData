[Workbench] Perspective popup menu doesn't show up on Mac
Build Id N20060425
The pop-up menu doesn't seem to appear on the Mac when you Ctr+Click on one of the perspective icons (i.e when in the Java Perspective, if you ctrk-click on the Java perspective icon, you should get a menu with options like: close, reset, customize, etc..)
