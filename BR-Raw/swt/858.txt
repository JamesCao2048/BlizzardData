GDI Handle Resource Leak

If you run the attached program and a tool that monitors GDI handles (either taskman with the 'GDI Handles' column added or procexp.exe), you will find that it leaks GDI handles pretty quickly.
The attachment is a very cut down version of a shipping program that was crashing in the field with a 'No More Handles' error.  Using Sleak, I found a couple that were mine, but it was still crashing.  I eventually got down to this, and I can't seem to reduce it any more without 'plugging' the leak.
In the code, there are lines marked "**X" where X is 1-4.  By commenting out all the lines marked either 1, 2, 3 or 4 together, the leak stops.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile attachment and use SWT 3.5
2. run taskman with the GDI Handles column added in the 'processes' tab
3. run the program
4. Note increasing number of GDI handles leaked (9-10 for every taskman update - appears to be 1 handled leaked per paint call)
Please note that while advanced graphics is not required for the features of this program, it is required in the original application, and removing it stops the leak.  It seems to be an interaction of a number of those lines, as you will see when you look at the various combinations of lines that stop the leak when commented.
