Disabling parent Composite doesn't throw FocusOut for the focused child control
On OS X when disabling the parent of the focus control a FocusOut event doesn't get fired for the control losing focus.  It looks like the issue is in the Control.forceFocus() and Display.getFocusControl(int).  When the "oldFocus" control is attempted to be retrieved from the display the display will return null because of the following check in Display.getFocusControl(int)...
if (widget != null && widget instanceof Control) {
Control control = (Control) widget;
>>>return control.isEnabled () ? control : null;<<<
}
The control is disabled so it's not returned as the focused control.  Attaching test case...
