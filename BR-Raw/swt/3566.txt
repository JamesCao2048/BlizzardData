GC.getCharWidth JUnit test failure on Win98
I20031008 on Windows 98
Test_org_eclipse_swt_graphics_GC.test_getCharWidthC
fails its assertion that the charWidth of 'a' is greater than 0.
I believe this is because the test does not set a font, and it relies on the
default font being valid.
This appears not to be the case on Win98?
Although other similar tests, like getTextExtent, getStringExtent,
getAdvanceWidth, and getFontMetrics all pass.
I will write a snippet to
investigate further.
