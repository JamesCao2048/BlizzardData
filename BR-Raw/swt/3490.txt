CoolBar loses lines between M4 and M5
I'm working with SWT since february this year, and for practice I modified
the WebBrowser example a little bit (used a coolbar with hotImage etc.).
I downloaded the last release of Eclipse M5 but my application appears
differently: no separator between the two cool item.
Steve Northover replied on the eclipse.platform.swt newsgroup that's a repaint
bug and to enter a bug report.
I've searched the most recently bugs, but didn't find reports relating to this
problem.
