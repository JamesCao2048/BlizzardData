Need a locale String from FontData
2.1
We need a way to get the Locale information so that it can be displayed.
On
Motif the FontDialog is laid out in such a way that the encoding looks like
the name and as a result it looks to the user like we have not displayed
anything.
We need to be able to display this value in the FontPreferencePage.
Something like getLocaleValue() would be fine.
