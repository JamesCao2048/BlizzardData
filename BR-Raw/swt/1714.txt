Link Widget: hyperlink parsing mangles certain input strings
The Link widget parses its text for embedded hyperlinks.
The parser code mangles certain input strings.
Code to reproduce:
Link link = new Link( parent, SWT.NONE );
link.setText( ">test<" );
displays as ">test>test<" in GTK (not reproducible with Windows, the win32 code doesn't use the parser output).
Expected: The link should show as ">test<" without any hyperlinks.
I agree that this is a rare use case, I only found it while unit-testing RAP.
However, it's a valid input string and should render as expected.
