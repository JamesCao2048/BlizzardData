Clicking on shell title bar causes activation events with null active shells
I200405140800.  Linux 2.6.4, GTK+ 2.4.0, KDE 3.2.1

I have a filter attached to the display listening for activation events.  I get
one activation event for every widget in the hierarchy.  However, it seems that
the display.getActiveShell() responds with "null" until the top-level shell
receives the activation event.  This means that while processing these
activation events, it appears as if no shell is active.

This does not happen on Windows XP.
