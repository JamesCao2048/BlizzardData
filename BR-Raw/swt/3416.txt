tracker resize uses screen coordinates instead of control
No matter what you use in tracker's first argument (display, parent shell, or control) the resulting
tracker is always displayed using screen coordinates when it is created with the SWT.RESIZE style bit.
Another problem is that the mouse responds very slowly, so that not only is the resize tracker not
where it's supposed to be, but it's very hard to use.
To reproduce use the same code as posted in  bug 40983, comment 2
