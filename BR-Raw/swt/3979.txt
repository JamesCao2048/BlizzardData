Multiple opened ApplicationWindows with statuslines show incorrect display/event handling
JFace ApplicationWindow :
When using a statusline in subclasses of ApplicationWindow AND opening multiple
instances, the event handling is not correct.
Example :
AppWindow A1 (incl.
addStatusLine() in constructor)
AppWindow A2 (incl.
addStatusLine() in constructor)
Behavior interference occurs when:

- opening muliple instances of A1

- or opening one instance of A1 and one instance of A2
