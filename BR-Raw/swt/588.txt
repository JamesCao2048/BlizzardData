VoiceOver doesn't read tooltip (help tag)
I20100706-0800
VoiceOver doesn't read the tooltip (help tag) of the current control on VO-Shift-H as described here:
http://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1124.html#mchlp2701
This also doesn't work in the Finder, but it works e.g.
in the System Preferences (Language & Text > Formats > Show all regions).
