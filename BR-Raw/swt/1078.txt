Screenshot of error dialog
After upgrading from 3.3 to 3.4, both the Open Type and Open Type Hierarchy dialogs no long work. In the screen shot provided you will see the error that appears. It just says 'Error'. No details. I've tried starting Eclipse in debug mode and nothing appears related to the dialog. I wish I have more information, but I was unable to get anything from debugging.
