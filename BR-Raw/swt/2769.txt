Foreground color gets lost when painting a Path
We have a test case which fails only on windows.
The test turns off advanced graphics, sets the foreground color to black, and
then draws a path.
The path is rendered using dark blue, the previous
foreground color used.
The class is AdvancedGraphicsTests in the draw2d.tests project.
the specific
test is "testPathDraw" which is commented out to avoid failing during our builds.
