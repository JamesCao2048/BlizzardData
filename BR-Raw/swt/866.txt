Can't print Image with alphas with transparent pixel unspecified
Created  attachment 141353   [details]
image to test
Use snippet form  bug 28766  and hard code the path to the attached test.png file
The image is not printed.
The image is converted from BufferedImage to SWT Image.
It has alphas specified and transparent pixel unspecified.
If I set transparent pixel = 0 then image is printed, but this seems to be a hack.
