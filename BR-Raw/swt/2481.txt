Eclipse freezes dismissing popup windows (Quick Fix, Spell Check, etc)
I'm a CS professor and have been programming and teaching Java since it came out.
But I've always used BBEDIT+ javac for my development on MAC & UNIX.
Now I'm learning about Eclipse with simple examples like "Hello world" but I find often that Eclipse stops responding and I have to use the FINDER "FORCE QUIT".
I'm using Eclipse 3.1 and Mac OSX 10.4.4.
What more can I say.
Mainly it occurs when I'm editing source code.
Today I've been doing JUNIT Tutorials.
So I download examples off the Internet and do cut and paste of code from the browser window.

Wish I could be more helpful but my code examples are quite simple and generally they work but then the application stops responding....
and it's the only application of the many I use that does this.
So I'll go back to BBEDIT and javac.
