Orca/Eclipse focus problems switching apps
From the orca mailing list:
-------------------
I don't know who is the guilt, orca or eclipse.
Probably both!
To reproduce try the following:
1.lanch eclipse.
I'm running build i20100504 but the problem can be reproduced with
previous versions.
2.choose a workspace.
3.Open the editor with some content.
4.Switch to another application pressing alt+tab.
5.Switch back to eclipse pressing alt+tab.
6.try to navigate the text by pressing the arrow.
for me nothing happens, Orca is muted.
The workaround is to press ctrl + tab and then tab.
Sometimes the workaround does not work and I use Plan B, press ctrl + f7
or ctrl+f8.
When Plan B does not work I use the Plan C, press the right mouse button.
Thanks!
