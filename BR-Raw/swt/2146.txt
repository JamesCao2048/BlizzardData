Eclipse gets SIGSEGV
Build ID: I20070209-1006
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open EMF ecore file (use Sample Ecore Model Editor)
2. Open Properties View for any attribute
3. Open pop-up menu for EType property
4. Using quick find select any type (for example type EString)
5. Press enter
6. Read info about segmentation fault in your shell
This way I can reproduce problem with 100% success. But sometimes I can
crash Eclipse using any pop-up menu.
