Moving a sash requires an extra click to take effect
Build F1 (20020521)
Redhat 7.2, GTK2, KDE 2.2-10
(GTK only)
See the SWT example ControlExample under the "Sash" tab.
If you click on the sash and drag the mouse then release, it doesn't do anything
except draw another sash (well, a gray bar) where you released. But then if you
click on that new sash then it resizes and refreshes everything properly.
I couldn't find any sashes in eclipse to confirm this so it's possible that the
problem is the example itself.
