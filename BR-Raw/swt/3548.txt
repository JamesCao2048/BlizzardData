Mouse events lost in shell launched from secondary application modal shell
Build 20031021
1.Started a 20031015 workspace with Eclipse build 20031021.
2.Imported all unshared projects
3.Got an information dialog saying that some plugins were missing
4.This dialog would not take any mouse input: I could not click Yes/No.
All it
did was beep.
Could not discard this dialog at all.
I had to kill the
workbench.
