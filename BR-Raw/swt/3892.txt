SWT widget org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Sash is not properly constrained when in HORIZONTAL mode.
The SWT "Sash" widget creates a sash that may be dragged by a mouse and is
either vertical or
horizontal. When created in HORIZONTAL mode, the sash can only move down
through its
container as far as the container is wide (not high).
