COMObject leakage on OleControlSite
Both constructors of  OleControlSite and OleClientSite calls the same
function : "createCOMInterfaces()".
If you create new instance of
OleControlSite, its field COMObjects (such as iDispatch, iUnknown) are
initialized two time but the first ones are never disposed.
COMObject::ObjectMap manages all instances of COMObject, so this
problem is java-side memory leakage as well as OLE resource leakage.
Any referencer of OleControlSite's instances are not garbage collected,
so this is not tiny problem.
