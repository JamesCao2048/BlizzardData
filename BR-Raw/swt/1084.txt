Combo.select() causes SelectionEvent
If I recall correctly programatic access to Combo should not cause any events
-- this was an SWT design choice.
My application enters an infinite loop on Cocoa where setting the selection causes a SelectionEvent, the event causes code in the listener to be invoked, the listener sets the Combo selection, ad infinitum.

The same issue doesn't occur on Windows or Carbon.
