disappearing checkbox with Windows XP look and feel
I have enabled the Windows XP look and feel with the instructions at
http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#xpthemes .
I am using jdk 1.4.2_09. Whenever
I have a checkbox in a list, the checkbox disappears when selected (and
reappears when deselected).
The checkbox text is always displayed correctly.
The checkbox can be toggled on/off while it is invisible.
I do not see this
behavior in the absence of a manifest file.
I see this behavior in the standard eclipse code in several places.
The most
obvious is the ProjectProperties->Java Build Path->Order and Export tab.
