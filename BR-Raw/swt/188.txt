Group client Area is wrong
Created  attachment 214870   [details]
test case
In eclipse, open the "Install New Software" dialog.
Note that the group labeled "Details" has a text area that touches (draws over) the group borders.
I attached a snippet that reproduces the problem.
The snippet has code from org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.ui.dialogs.IUDetailsGroup, but also has a smaller test case.
This bug is happening because of the change for  bug#302802 .
Lakshmi, do you understand what was the problem in  bug#302802 ?
I do not see anything wrong if I remove the fix:
widget.setContentViewMargins(new NSSize());
For me the current behaviour is wrong.
I believe we should remove that fix.
