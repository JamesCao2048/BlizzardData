Mac: Menu Cleared After Shell Restored From Dock
Create two new, non-modal Shells with MenuBars.
Minimize one Shell to the Dock (making the other
active).
Restore the minimized Shell.
The MenuBar is now AWOL.
Switching applications or Shells will
bring it back again.
Observed with SWT 3.1 and Mac OS X 10.4.2.
