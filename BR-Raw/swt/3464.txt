Broken arrows on multi page
In eclipse-SDK-N20040125-linux-gtk
(I'm developing a plug-in)
Run->Debug...
This opens the window "Create, manage and run configurations"
Select run-time workbench->run-time workbench. This shows a screen with many
"pages":
test,arguments,classpath,JRE,...
If the window is too small to show all the page tabs, two arrows are shown to go
to the other tabs.
These arrows do not work!
The same trick with many pages and arrows has no problems in other places: e.g.
when editing a lot of files in the "Java Perspective".
Sorry if I get the component wrong (again): is it debug or UI??
If someone can point me to some guidelines for determining the failing
component, I'll try to get the component name right next time :-)
