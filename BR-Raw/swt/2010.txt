Can't copy and paste into dialog text fields from some applications
I've noticed this problem for some time. I can't copy and paste a password from Splash ID (a password manager application) to SWT text fields. A paste action seems to delete the contents of the field. However, I can copy and paste into other Eclipse UI elements, such as the editor. More weird, is that I can copy and paste from other MacOS X applications, such as Safari, into the text fields.
