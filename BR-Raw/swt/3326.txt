[Menus] menu items missing on first click
linux motif version 3.0M9 (also in previous versions)
Sun JDK 1.4.2
When I first right-click on an item in the resource view (left pane in default
Java perspective) there are items that do no appear in the context menu
Today I noticed that "Properties" was missing from a project context menu.

"Close Project" is also missing on the first click.
On the second click, or if
the project is already selected, then the menu items appear
