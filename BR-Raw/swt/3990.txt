Step filter in-place text editor invisible
Build 2.0
Linux-GTK
1. Go to Window->Preferences->Java->Debug->Step Filtering
2. Click "Add Filter"
3. A checkbox appears in the tree, but there is no visible text editor.
4. Type "asdf". No text appears.
5. Hit ENTER. The text "asdf" now appears.
We need to either fix the in-place text editor or get rid of it and replace it
with a simple text-input area above the tree.
