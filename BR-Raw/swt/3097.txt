Cheese appears in table when using mouse wheel
(Note, I'm using the Windows XP manifest file)
When I use the wheel on my mouse to scroll down in the table in the tasks
view, extra lines appear all over the table. When I scroll up, all of the
horizontal lines disappear.
The scrollbar does not demonstrate the same problem.
