Strange scrolling of native table
N2003-03-05
- If you add a new entry to the task view, the native table is scrolled
completely to the right, showing an area where there is no column.
- If you open the label decorator preferences, the table is scrolled to the
right, not revealing the checkboxes to toggle decorators. You have to scroll
to the left to make them appear.
