[OLE] OleClientSite fails open document if Microsoft Word is not installed
The OleClientSite constructor which takes a File, in one particular code path, attempts to look up a CLSID for "Word.Document" (the Microsoft Word ProgID).  It's doing this to determine whether to use the default CONTENTS stream in an OLE storage, or to use "WordDocument", which is where Word puts it's own stuff.
The code is:
GUID wordGUID = getClassID(WORDPROGID);
if (COM.IsEqualGUID(appClsid, wordGUID)) streamName = "WordDocument";
If the document being opened isn't a Word document, then the code should do nothing, but the getClassID call includes this code:
if (COM.CLSIDFromProgID(buffer, guid) != COM.S_OK){
int result = COM.CLSIDFromString(buffer, guid);
if (result != COM.S_OK)
OLE.error(OLE.ERROR_INVALID_CLASSID, result);
}
If looking up the GUID fails for any reason, an exception is thrown, which aborts the whole operation.  Looking up the "Word.Document" GUID fails when Microsoft Word isn't installed.
This code path is used when you're opening a file using an editor other than the default editor that's registered - this is a supported operation, and should work.
The fix should be simple - catch and suppress the exception thrown by getClassID(WORDPROGID), since this call can be expected to fail when Word isn't installed.
