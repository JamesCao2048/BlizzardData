StyledText scroll not working with PageUp/Down keys.
When all contensts are selected in StyledText, PageDown or PageUp keys does not
scroll the client area so that the caret is shown in the window.
Behavior of ArrowDown and ArrowUp keys looks good.
With TextEditor:
1) Open the text file which is large enough to show a vertical scrollbar.
2) Scroll down to the middle of the file.
3) Edit
-> Select All
4) Push PageUp key.
