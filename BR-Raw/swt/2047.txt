Link widget calculates incorrect width when "&" is part of text
Build ID: M20060629-1905
Steps To Reproduce:
Try this:
Link link = new Link (parent, SWT.NONE);
link.setText ("Me && I");
The calculated width is incorrect and the "I" gets clipped.
(you can put the <a> link brackets around it, but that doesn't matter).
The text displayed is correctly: "Me & I"
More information:
This happens for Windows under the conditions of v6 controls. The fix for this case should be quite simple: in Link.computeSize, you need to add "DT_NOPREFIX" as a flag to "OS.DrawText (hDC, buffer, buffer.length (), rect, flags);"
Alternatively you could let the SysLink control tell you the preferred size. See LM_GETIDEALSIZE.
The problem occurs because parse() is called on "Me && I", which correctly produces "Me & I", the display string. However, OS.DrawText will convert the & into a mnemonic, shortening the string to "Me  I" (with an underline).
Since the SysLink control is being used to render the full text and does the "<a>" and mnemonic parsing anyway, seems like the safest fix would be to use LM_GETIDEALSIZE and let it tell you the size.
