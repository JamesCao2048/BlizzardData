Shell opened on KDE3.2.x does not paint
When a workbench window is first opened, it does not paint any of its contents
(e.g., menu bars, cool bars, tool bars, composites, etc.).  By moving or
resizing the workbench window, a paint occurs and the contents become visible.

This occurs using I200404270800 and GTK+ 2.4.0.  It does not occur on similar
machines running GTK+ 2.2.x.
