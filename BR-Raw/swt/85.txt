TreeViewers throw NPE's on collapsed multi-selections
If you select multiple elements in the Package Explorer and then collapse the tree using the *toolbar button* (not the + on the tree itself) then you will start seeing multiple NPEs reported. Changing the selection in the tree causes the problem to go away.
