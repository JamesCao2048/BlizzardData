Right click on Tree does not honor the SWT.FULL_SELECTION style
The Property View uses a Tree with the FULL_SELECTION style bit on. If you left-
click anyhere the entry gets selected. However, if you RIGHT-click then the
selection only occurs if you are over the rightmost label's text.
To repro:
Open the Property View
Select a file in the Package Explorer / Navigator
Left click to select a row
Right click on some other row (outside the label text)...no sel change.
In this particular case it is causing at least one defect ( Bug 103547 ) to occur
in the Property View...
