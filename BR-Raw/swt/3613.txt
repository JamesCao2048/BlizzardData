Exception causes Members view to become empty
Occasionaly when I switch between editors, I get an exception and the Members
view no longer shows any contents even when different Java files are selected.
Closing and opening the Members view fixes the problem.
I am running Eclipse GTK
I20030813 on Red Hat 9.0.I will attach the log file.
