[browser] Curious behaviour on target=_blank links
Hi,
I am using the SWT browser widget to display HTML and let the user navigate
through the WWW in my application.
Earlier the browser ignored clicking on links that would open in a new window
(with having target="_blank").
I've now found out the OpenWindowListener which could solve my problem. Playing
around with it, I came up to this snippet, which shows a very strange behaviour:
public static void main(String[] args) {
Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
shell.setText("Main Window");
shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
Browser browser = new Browser(shell, SWT.NONE);
initialize(display, browser);
shell.open();
browser.setUrl("C:/index.html");
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch())
display.sleep();
}
display.dispose();
}
static void initialize(final Display display, Browser browser) {
browser.addOpenWindowListener(new OpenWindowListener() {
public void open(WindowEvent event) {
event.browser.getUrl();	//Comment / Uncomment
this line!
}
});
}
The file "index.html" is a local HTML file with a simple link that uses
target="_blank".
Having the "event.browser.getUrl();" commented, nothing happens. But when
uncommented, after clicking on the URL it opens in my system default browser
(IE).
I am also wondering, why the WindowEvent event does not provide information
about the URL that the new browser-window will load?
Regards,
Ben
