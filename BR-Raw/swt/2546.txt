Checkbox tree selection makes checkbox hard to see
build I20060119
- edit a launch config
- on the plugins tab, select Choose Plug-ins...
- select an item and toggle its checkbox
- the change is very hard to see due to low contrast between the selection and checkbox (black over dark blue)
I'm using the Windows Standard appearance settings on Win2K.
