Tooltip for CTabFolder shows up on wrong monitor
I200403260800
Using a dual-monitor setup on Windows XP.
Open Eclipse with at least one editor and let the mouse hover over the editor's
tab. Notice that a tooltip opens showing the current filename.
Now move Eclipse to another monitor and try the same thing. Notice that the
tooltips will always open on the same monitor, regardless of which monitor
contains Eclipse (that is, they will display correctly on one monitor but not
the other).
This seems to be an issue with CTabItem and CTabFolder. For your reference, the
problematic widgets are created in
org.eclipse.ui.internal.presentations.EditorPresentation.
