DBCS: input special symbol breaks input method on ja_JP
Trying to input special symbols using kinput2 (default linux input method for
ja_JP on Linux) breaks the input method on the widget.
Steps
1) Focus a Text widget
2) Start input method (Shift+Space)
3) Open Auxiliary Control Window (Insert)
4) Choose a symbol and press enter
5) Close the input method (Shift+Space)

Bug:
- The symbol is insert on the widget twice
- Warning on the console:
(<unknown>:22311): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: gsignal.c:1972: handler `69' of
instance `0x81321b8' is not blocked
- From now on any input (SBCS or DBCS) that goes thru the commit won't be insert
on the widget.
For the StyledText inserting symbols does not work but attemping to do so does
not cause the input method to stop work.
Works on Motif.
