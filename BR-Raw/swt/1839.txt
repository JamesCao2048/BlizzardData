StyledText#setSelection() does not reveal caret at end of line

StyledText#setSelection() does not reveal caret at end of line. Steps:
- CustomControlExample > StyledText
- Size: 50 X 50
- set caret to before "One"
- Set/Get API
- setSelection to 58,58
- give focus to the text area without changing the caret location (e.g. click to the StyledText tab and then press the Tab key)
=> caret is not visible (it is just after "One Two Three")
This problem is also visible in Eclipse text editors when you press the End key on a long line. The "native" End key behavior in StyledText is OK.
