[SWT_AWT] SWT_AWT.new_Shell(display, Canvas) crashes the application with "Invalid memory access"
Build Identifier: SWT N20101016-2000
When a window of a web browser is opening, we create a new Swing JFrame and add a Canvas which will contain the new web browser.
Calling new_Shell(xx) crashes the application.
This means that all window opening causes the issue, so this impacts web browsing, HTML editors relying on popup windows, etc.
Reproducible: Always
