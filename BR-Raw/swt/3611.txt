Text - No Verify/Modify when a modifier key is down
Eclipse 3.0M2
It's not possible to create classpath variables with underscores. The dialog displays the error
message "A variable name must be entered". When you remove the underscore and re-add it, the
message has disappeared but the created classpath variable will not be created as specified.
Sometimes the underscore is missing, sometimes characters at the end of the variable.
