[Browser]Can't visit sharing folder in internal browser if path depth>2
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
Open internal browser, try to visit a sharing folder in another machine: e.g.
input url "file://<machine ip>/<folderA>/<folderB>/<folderC>" in browser.
There will be no authorization dialog prompt up to let user input username and password, and internal browser will tell user "This program cannot display the webpage" after hang a few minutes.
But if the path depth
< 2, e.g.
visit  file://<machine ip> or file://<machine ip>/<folderA>, everything will be ok.
