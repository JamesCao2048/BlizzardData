OLE part have a access violation exception
First time to report a bug here -- and new to eclipse.
This bug is relating to the OLE part, so only appear on Windows platform.
I am trying to put some ActiveX control in my application, and I need to get a
IDispatch property of an OleAutomation.
I call OleAutomation.getProperty(), this function will then invoke the
underlying IDispatch.invoke(), and later call into Variant.setData() to copy the
result into the Variant structure.
In the Variant.setData() function, there is something as:
case COM.VT_DISPATCH : {
int[] ppvObject = new int[1];
OS.MoveMemory(ppvObject, pData + 8, 4);
dispatchData = new IDispatch(ppvObject[0]);
dispatchData.AddRef();
break;
}
This is for when the return type is VT_DISPATCH, then create a IDispatch object
and AddRef() to it. Unfortunately, ppvObject[0] can be null. In this case,
AddRef() crash the system.
I believe, this part of code should be:
case COM.VT_DISPATCH : {
int[] ppvObject = new int[1];
OS.MoveMemory(ppvObject, pData + 8, 4);
if (ppvObject[0]!=null) {
dispatchData = new IDispatch(ppvObject[0]);
dispatchData.AddRef();
} else {
dispatchData = null;
}
break;
}
BTW I like SWT very much.
