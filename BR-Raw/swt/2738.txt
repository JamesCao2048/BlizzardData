SWT bugs: GDI Handles leak
Running Eclipse SDK
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050617-1618
Some GDI objects are allocated but never released eventually causing
SWTError: No more handles
(1) Class:    org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Image
Method:   int[] createGdipImage()
At the very end of creating an icon, the following code lines:
if (iconInfo.hbmColor == 0) OS.DeleteObject(iconInfo.hbmColor);
if (iconInfo.hbmMask == 0) OS.DeleteObject(iconInfo.hbmMask);
should be simply changed to:
if (iconInfo.hbmColor != 0) OS.DeleteObject(iconInfo.hbmColor);
if (iconInfo.hbmMask != 0) OS.DeleteObject(iconInfo.hbmMask);
(2) Class:    org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC
Method:   void fillGradientRectangle()
These two Colors are allocated:
int fromGpColor = Gdip.Color_new(data.alpha
<< 24 | rgb);
int toGpColor = Gdip.Color_new(data.alpha
<< 24 | rgb);
However, wrong parameters are passed for their release:
Gdip.Color_delete(fromColor); //this is the text color value not Handle!
Gdip.Color_delete(toColor);//this is the background color value not Handle!
Please note that the above leaks happen every time the screen gets painted an
an icon is there or a shape with gradient fill is enabled.
The leaked handles
add up quite quickly and crash Eclipse.
