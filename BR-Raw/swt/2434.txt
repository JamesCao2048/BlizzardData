[64] Crash when pressing ENTER after having entered value in "Search" form
SUSE Linux Professional 9.3
1 GB RAM
I am starting eclipse with a minimal bash script:
#!/bin/sh
EXE=$HOME/local/eclipse/eclipse
JAVA=/home/kjk/local/jdk-1_5_0_05-linux-amd64/bin/java
$EXE -vm $JAVA -showLocation $*
I am not using an external help browser.
Recipe:
- Select "Help Contents" from the "Help" menu
- Write any word in the "Search" field
- Press ENTER
In 100% of the cases, Eclipse crashes with this message:
# An unexpected error has been detected by HotSpot Virtual Machine:
#
#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00002aaaaae4ac75, pid=17632, tid=46912501717760
#
# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (1.5.0_05-b05 mixed mode)
# Problematic frame:
# C  [libc.so.6+0x6fc75]  memmove+0x85
(I will soon try to attach the .log file)
The reason for my not choosing severity "critical" is that the workaround is
simple: Click the "GO" button instead of pressing ENTER.
