"Alt+Space" traversal cannot be blocked
Using snippet #25 on Windows XP, pressing "Alt+Space" generates the following:
DOWN: stateMask=0x0, keyCode=0x10000, character=0x0 '0'
By clicking back on the shell, a subsequent event is triggered (note, if 'Alt'
is still held, then the stateMask=0x10000):
DOWN: stateMask=0x0, keyCode=0x20, character=0x20 ' '
Attaching a listener to SWT.Traverse events on the display registers a
mnemonic traversal.
However, setting "event.doit=false" has no effect.
The
system menu is still displayed.
Using snippet #25 on Linux-GTK (GNOME), clicking back on the shell does not
send a subsequent event.
DESIRED RESULTS:
"Alt+Space" should send a SWT.Traverse event that can be cancelled by
setting "event.doit=false".
If the event is not cancelled, then the key
events sent should be consistent across platforms.
