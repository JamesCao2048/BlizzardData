Setting font for Table headers does not work
Assigning a new font to a Table sets the new font for the rows within the table,
but leaves the Table headers as they are.
It DOES work under Win32, though.
I looked in the SWT source code (for Win32) for tableéº“s setFont() method, and
found the following ...
Maybe something similiar needs to be done for GTK, too ?
public void setFont (Font font) {
checkWidget ();
super.setFont (font);
setScrollWidth ();
/*
* Bug in Windows.
Setting the font will cause the
* table area to be redrawn but not the column headers.
* Fix is to force a redraw on the column headers.
*/
...
doing the native stuff ...
