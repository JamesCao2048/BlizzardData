GTK: X pointer grab when resizing a table column
Build 20021009
Linux/GTK
1.Open the stack view.
2.Position the mouse on the border of a resizable column.
3.Press the right button.
4.Quickly, move the mouse and release the button.
The cursor image remainds the resize image and no input events are managed.
I
have to kill the vm from a consol.
