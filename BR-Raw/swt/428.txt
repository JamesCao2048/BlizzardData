Control.setTouchEventsEnabled(boolean)/isTouchEnabled() not consistent
In the new API in Control.java to enabled touch events, the setter name is not consistent with the getter (TouchEvents instead of Touch).
Also, traditionally if an API starts with is* in Control.java, it means that the state of the widget parent is checked.
This is not the case for this API, so it should be getTouchEnabled() instead of isTouchEnabled().
