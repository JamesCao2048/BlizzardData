Build F1 (and F2 too)
Steps:
1) Start ControlExample
2) Choose the "List" tab
3) Click on "Set Font" and choose a smaller font (manually type in a size if
necessary
-- you need to do this to get anything smaller than 8 pt in Win32)
4) Click on "Preferred" radio button, even though it's already selected
5) Uncheck "SWT.H_SCROLL"
6) Notice that the List widget gets bigger
7) Check "SWT.H_SCROLL"
