[Widgets] Embedded native view can not receive Enter key event on Mac.

Build Identifier: 3.5.1
Due to the changes in Display.textInputProc() for bug  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=194887 , embedded native view can not receive Enter key event from on Mac.
For 3.4.2, the Widget widget = getWidget (theControl [0]); in textInputProc() returns null.
So SWT does not handle the event.
With the patch for 194887, Widget widget = getFocusControl (theWindow, false); will return a SWT composite, and in SWT composite , it will filter out the Enter key event.
So the event could not be passed to the native view.
Reproducible: Always
