gc.setTransform() makes fonts scale strangely when printing
The use of transformations seems to have strange influcence on the scaling of
fonts. When I add the following two code lines before writing out text using
gc.drawString(), fonts get scaled about 4 times as large as it should.
Transform transform = new Transform(device);
gc.setTransform(transform);
As far as I understand, these two operations should be a no-op. If look at the
values in transform, these are
Transform {1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0}
I tried calling "gc.getTransform(transform)" as well, but this call returns an
equal transform object as calling "new Transform(device)".
