Need to suppress "untitled window" on GTK
20040210 New Look and HEAD
Any time that we create another window we get something in the system tray with
the title "untitled window". We need a way to prevent this due to the following
cases:
1) The detached windows in New Look
2) The Progress floating window
3) Floating toolbars in new look
