[DND] Navigator DND does not work
build 20021001
Dragging items in the resource navigator does not work. The drag icon appears,
but there is no drop location feedback.
NavigatorDragAdapter.dragStart checks whether the drag source actually has
focus. Display.getFocusControl returns null even though the tree viewer does
have focus. When I comment out this check and dragStart lets the drop operation
continue the drop adapter still does not get a dragEnter event.
Package view DND no longer works either.
Did SWT change anything wrt. Motif DND that could have broken this?
