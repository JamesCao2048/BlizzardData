[DND] Cannot drag and drop files between the Finder (ie. Cocoa and Carbon apps)
Just entering a bug based on Scott's comments so that it's not lost.
Comments from Scott:
At this point I鈥檓 aware of only one known problem. Cocoa apps don鈥檛 have a way to provide a list of files to the Finder using HFSFlavors like you have in Carbon. Instead, you place an NSArray of file names on the dragging clipboard with a flavor of NSFilenamesPboardType. Other Cocoa-based apps can understand that format, and I verified it works, but the Finder and other Carbon apps do not, so they don鈥檛 recognize the drag data. I don鈥檛 know what functionality is expected of FileTransfer across platforms, so I don鈥檛 know if the Carbon behavior was accidental or deliberate. Cocoa lets you do HFS promise file drags, but I don鈥檛 think that鈥檚 the same thing. I鈥檒l do what I can to follow up with folks at Apple.
