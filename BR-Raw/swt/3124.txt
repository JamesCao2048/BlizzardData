Sash no longer draggable when too small
Hi,
see this snippet:
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
final Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
SashForm form = new SashForm(shell, SWT.HORIZONTAL | SWT.SMOOTH);
form.setLayout(new FillLayout());
Composite child1 = new Composite(form, SWT.NONE);
child1.setLayout(new FillLayout());
new Label(child1, SWT.NONE).setText("Label in pane 1");
Composite child2 = new Composite(form, SWT.NONE);
child2.setLayout(new FillLayout());
new Button(child2, SWT.PUSH).setText("Button in pane2");
Composite child3 = new Composite(form, SWT.NONE);
child3.setLayout(new FillLayout());
new Label(child3, SWT.PUSH).setText("Label in pane3");
form.setWeights(new int[] { 30, 40, 30 });
shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch())
display.sleep();
}
display.dispose();
}
}
Grab the second Sash (right to the button), move it as far as possible to the
left (the button becomes very thin). Try to grab the same Sash again. Notice
that its not possible.
Note: Bug does not occur when not using SWT.SMOOTH
Suggestion: Its possible to size the button thiner, as without SWT.SMOOTH. I
guess when using SWT.SMOOTh the button becomes that thin, that the Sash itself
becomes invisible. The SashForm should not allow to resize the Sash to a smaller
value than possible when not using SWT.SMOOTH.
