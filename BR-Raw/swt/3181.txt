That error means that an NSURLConnection object was released, but code
was still trying to work with it.

Yes, I think the resource load delegate callbacks are probably too
low-level to allow a loadRequest right inside one that replaces the
page that you're being called back about.
Generally the resource load delegate is not what you should be using to
change what clicking on a link does, though.
That should be done with
the policy delegate.
