rssowl: controls are clipped
- select "EclipseZone: News", right-click > Properties
- on the General tab note that the second-last line of controls is clipped along the bottom
- interesting to note that this does not happen for these controls if a folder's properties are viewed instead, the only difference between the two cases is the presence of the "Link:" row of controls at the top
