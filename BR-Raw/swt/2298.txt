ComboViewerTest dies with BadMatch error
Our ComboViewerTest in org.eclipse.ui.tests dies about test 6 with:
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
(Details: serial 7863 error_code 8 request_code 1 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the
--sync command line
option to change this behavior.
You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
