Saving a docx file fails silently due to not killing WINWORD process on close
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Editing a docx in the in-place editor and saving appears to work, but after closing and reopening the file you will not see the changes made.
If you check running processes, you will see WINWORD still running after closing the editor.
If you manually kill the process after closing the editor, any changes made will be there when reopening the file.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a docx with in-place editor
2.Make changes and save
3.Close editor and reopen [changes will not be there]
4.Check running processes for WINWORD [still running]
