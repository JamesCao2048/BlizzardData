When shell is created with SWT.NO_TRIM, windows does not show it on task bar
When shell is created with SWT.NO_TRIM, windows does not show it on the task bar.
Thus we can t switch tasks to get to this shell.
It works fine under Linux. It looks like a windows limitation ? The issue is
that having no trim for windows is something nice, but still we don t want to
'lose' the application.
Additionnaly, if the window has a non rectangular shape, when the shell is
minimized, it is minimized as a window limited to a top bar, with the top bar
being 'cut' to the region of the shell. It does not look clean.
