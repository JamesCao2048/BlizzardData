Save As.. dialog is not seeded with selection's file name
Cocoa issue.
This is verifiable by attempting to view an attachment for a bug on Eclipse.org that has been uploaded as (application/octet-stream).
When the Save As..
dialog comes up the file name text field is blank, while on Carbon this field would have been populated by with the original file's name.
