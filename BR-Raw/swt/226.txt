Tooltips not appearing properly
Build Identifier: 4.2 Build id: I20120429-1800
Tooltips all over Eclipse (toolbar icons, view icons, basically wherever tooltips appear) are flashing for less than a second and disappearing immediately. This is after fix for  bug 46025  was committed but I'm still not sure what is causing the problem.
The problem also seems very similar to the behavior reported in  bug 354126 .
Reproducible: Always
