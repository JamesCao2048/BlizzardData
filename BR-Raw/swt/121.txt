Skip gtk_check_version for gtk 3.0+.
This will effectively allow trying to start against any major version of Gtk bigger than 3. Considering that it would be fairly hard work to compile/link against such version trying to run is not a problem. It's done this way because gtk_check_version returns false if the major version is different no matter higher or lower but we need a way to try running against multiple major version from the java side.
