Improve SWT performance over GTK window system
There are several places in SWT over GTK that may be improved w.r.t performance.
I am going to attach a document describing such places and suggested
improvements for them.
I would like community to review the rpoposal, comment on it and add other
problems that relate to the subject if any. Once modification proposals are
finilized and approved our team would like to implement it in SWT 3.1.
