CLabel not correctly captured by WM_PRINT
I use WM_PRINT to capture offscreen controls in one of my application. I notice
that all the controls I use are well captured, except CLabel : the font is not
taken in account (but images, background color and foreground color are).
See my attached image and have a look at a sample java project I wrote to
explain the problem.
