Shell doesn't send SWT.Move

Registration of the windowDidMove()
Shell doesn't send SWT.Move when it's being moved.
It has a correct implementation of windowDidMove(), but this method is never called because it isn't registered.
The attached patch adds an appropriate string to the Display.initClasses().
