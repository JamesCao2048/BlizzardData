Cocoa port has no org.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts equivalent
Eclipse Carbon ships with the org.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts flag turned on and I like to add it to me self-hosted workspaces as well.
I feel that Eclipse benefits from the smaller fonts on OS X.
The Cocoa port doesn't have any small fonts support so far.
Is that intentional?
