block selection: handle multi-line paste
in a paste operation with a multi-line text each line should to be inserted to the correspondent line in the block selection.
Special cases.
m = number of lines in the clipboard text
n = number of lines in the block selection
n > m: n-m last lines in the block selection will have no text inserted in it.
m > n: m-n lines past of last line of the block selection will have the text insert at the closest offset where the left edge of block selection insertects the line.
text inserted in the StyledText through StyledText#insert(String) should follow the same rules.
