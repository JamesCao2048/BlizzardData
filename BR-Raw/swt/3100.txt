Control.redraw() invalidates children on Linux-GTK
The code for redraw() on Linux-GTK calls redrawWidget (..., true) which causes
the children to be repainted as well.
This behaviour is not consistent with
Windows, and seems to be in error:
public void redraw () {
checkWidget();
int /*long*/ paintHandle = paintHandle ();
int width = OS.GTK_WIDGET_WIDTH (paintHandle);
int height = OS.GTK_WIDGET_HEIGHT (paintHandle);
redrawWidget (0, 0, width, height, true);
}
I think it should use redrawWidget (..., false) instead.
