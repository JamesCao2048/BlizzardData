Eclipse Cocoa: drag and drop in Package Explorer sometimes incorrectly shows icon indicating illegal drop target
Build ID: I20081211-1908
Steps To Reproduce:
1. Package Explorer: Top Level Elements > Working Sets, and create a working set, e.g. "my working set"
2. New Java project "foo"; it will show up in the "Other Projects" working set
3. Drag project "foo" onto "my working set"
Actual result:
Sometimes, the cursor will be shown with a "don't drop here" circle-with-slash, indicating that you aren't allowed to drop it.  (See screenshot.)  But if you do drop it, it moves just fine.
Expected result:
Mouse cursor should correctly indicate whether it is over a valid drop target.
