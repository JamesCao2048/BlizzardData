Add Menu.setRedraw(boolean) API
On windows, when the workbench removes a number of menu item and adds a number
of menu item, it causes the menu bar to flash a lot. I hack the Menu class to
have a setRedraw(boolean) method, and by doing so, it eliminated the flash we
were seeing.
Is it possible to have this API? It is important to overall feel of the
workbench. Can this be fixed for 2.1?
