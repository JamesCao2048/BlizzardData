Interactive text selection lags on Linux-GTK+
The highlighted text selection in the Eclipse editor often lags behind my mouse
on my P3-733.  If I rapidly select some text in the editor, the caret seems to
follow directly with my mouse movements, while the highlight block trails
behind.  Since the caret can keep up, the problem does not seem to be with the
event propagation or mouse motion hints.
The responsiveness can be improved by flushing GTK+'s outstanding repaints after
processing each mouse event.  StyledText handles mouse move events by calling
Control.redraw() for each line of text that has changed.  This uses
gdk_window_invalidate_rect() to invalidate the region internally in GTK+.  This
will not generate an expose event until the GTK+ event loop goes idle.
The following patch in StyledText.handleMouseMove() improves the situation on my
machine.  Note that update() also flushes any expose events from the X server,
which is not necessary in this case since all of the invalidations are done
internally using gdk_window_invalidate_rect().  However, since this operation is
interactive, I am not sure this really matters.
