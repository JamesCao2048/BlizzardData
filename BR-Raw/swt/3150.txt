Selection in open type dialog does not work
I200411010800, I200411021200, GTK+ 2.2.1

This problem is specific to GTK+ 2.2.1. It does not occur in GTK+ 2.2.4 or the
GTK+ 2.4.0 series.
Open the "Open Type" dialog, and type in part of a class
name (not a complete class name).
Normally, this should select the top item.

Currently, it selects nothing.
