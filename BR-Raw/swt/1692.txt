Transform.setIdentity() method is needed
I suggest to add Transform.setIdentity() method. Since all Transform modifiers (multiply, rotate, scale, translate) modify existing transform matrix I think setIdentity() is a necessity. I suppose a typical UI developer might not be familiar with transform matrices and would be completely lost as to what arguments to pass to Transform.setElements(float,...) method.
