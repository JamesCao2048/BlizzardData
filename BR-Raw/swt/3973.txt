2104: Converter contains references to Converter.class
in 2104 (and in HEAD), in Motif, the class org.eclipse.swt.internal.Converter
contains 3 references to Converter.class.
This doesn't work on CLDC 1.0, which
does not contain the class NoClassDefFoundError.
This NoClassDefFoundError
class is referenced in the expansion of the compiler construct XXX.class.
See  bug 21706  for another example of this.
