Problems implementing MenuItem.setText (worked around for English)
On the Mac the menu accelerator text isn't specified as a string but via a bitset similar to
SWT's accelerator used in MenuItem.setAccelerator. In addition the accelerator's string is
set as a side effect of setting the accelerator itself. So they are always in synch.
Therefore in the SWT Mac port I was ignoring the accelerator part of the string given to
MenuItem.setText(...) and I was using the bitset from MenuItem.setAccelerator(). I was
relying on the assumption that both should be in synch. However this assumption is now
broken. MenuItems on which an accelerator string has been set with setText  typically
have the accelerator 0, other menu items where the accelerator is not 0 have no
accelerator string set.
For the Mac port this means I have to parse the string given to MenuItem.setText.
However, since the string is already localized parsing isn't feasible.
How can I solve this dilemma?
BTW: why are SWT's clients allowed to play dirty tricks with accelerators? I'm not sure
that I can get accelerators to work on MacOS X (without introducing wads of bogus code).
