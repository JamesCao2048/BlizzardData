ScrolledComposite vertical scroll problem with StackLayout
I have an org.eclipse.swt.custom.ScrolledComposite composite which has an
org.eclipse.swt.custom.StackLayout layout. I have multiple controls on the
scrolled composite. If the first control I add to the scrolled composite does
not need a vertical scroll bar, later calls to set the content to a control
that does need the vertical scroll bar do not produce a working scroll bar.
I looked at the source for scrolled composite and immediately saw the problem:
the vScroll() method bases its calculations for the location off the first
child of the composite, not the current content control. hScroll() correctly
uses the content variable to get the location, etc.
To get this to work, I rewrote vScroll() in the same style as hScroll():
private void vScroll() {
if (content == null) return;
Point location = content.getLocation ();
ScrollBar vBar = getVerticalBar ();
int vSelection = vBar.getSelection ();
content.setLocation (location.x, -vSelection);
}
This fixes the problem.
* I can't think of a reason why this method was written differently than hScroll
().
* I can't imagine that a lot of people are ever going to discover this problem.
* No idea if this still exists in 2.0
