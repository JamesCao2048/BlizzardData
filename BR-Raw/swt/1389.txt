Wrong cursor when editing
This happens in Eclipse.
Open the console and a java editor.
Give the Java editor focus, the move the mouse over the console and notice the I-beam cursor.
Give focus to the console.
The I-beam changes to the default arrow.
Move the mouse over the editor, then back into the console.
The I-beam is back and stays now.
The I-beam should not go away.
