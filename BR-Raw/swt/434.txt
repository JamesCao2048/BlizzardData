[refactoring] Cocoa only: Preview page in org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring.RefactoringWizard shows no changes when empty space is clicked
Build Identifier: 20100917-0705
In Cocoa, when the refactoring preview dialog shows a tree and changes underneath, clicking on the white or empty area next to the tree causes selection to be reset and changes to go away.
This is not the case in windows and it may not be immediately apparent to the user as to what happened.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Keep the cursor over a method name in a Java file.
2.Choose Source
-> Change Method Signature.
3.Click on Add.
4.Click on Preview.
5.Click the white area under "Changes to be performed".
Notice that selection of the tree went away and "No preview available" is shown.
This is unexpected and confusing.
