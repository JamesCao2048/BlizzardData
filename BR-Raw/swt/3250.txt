Setting a ToolItem's control to a Button doesn't work in Linux GTK
In a ToolBar, setting a ToolItem's control to a Button doesn't work in Linux
GTK.  I was under the impression that it should work, since it worked in
Windows and adding other SWT controls such as Text worked.
A workaround was to add the button to a Composite first.
