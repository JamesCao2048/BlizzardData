Seen on both Solaris and Linux GTK
Run the control example, go to Canvas. Click on H_SCROLL and V_SCROLL.
Set background color and foreground color to something noticeable.
Turn off H_SCROLL and V_SCROLL -> color goes away.
Turn them back on -> color comes back.
Turn them off and turn on BORDER -> color comes back.
