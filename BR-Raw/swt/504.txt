textcelleditor text control lost focus after setfocus on cocoa when text is empty
Build Identifier: I20100921-1024
Problem exhibited in Eclipse 3.6 and 3.6.1, only under Cocoa builds (32 and 64 bit).
I tried overriding the TextCellEditor to change doSetFocus to not call setFocus and in this case, the text control appears as normal and does not defocus/dismiss.  Of course there is no cursor in the text control.  However, I do note that if "tab" is hit at this point, focus will go to the text control and it does not defocus/dismiss.
I also tried a variety of other tactics including modifying the enablement of the control, using other select mechanisms instead of setFocus/selectAll.  I also tried doing the setFocus in an async display runnable, and other actions in the runnable.  I also tried changing the text content to temporarily not be empty in doSetFocus. (and change it back immediately after setFocus, or later in async runnable)
Only one thing worked to behave "somewhat correctly":
in doSetFocus, avoid calling setFocus.  instead, create a timed display runnable to call setFocus later.  if (later <= 550 milliseconds) this doesn't work.  if (later >= 700 milliseconds) it seems to work reliably.  if (later == 600 milliseconds) it works sometimes.
Is this perhaps related to  Bug 313208
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a Tree, use a TextCellEditor for editing the cell
2. Click on the cell to activate the editor for a cell which has an empty string as value
3. The text control appears and has normal behavior
4. Deselect the editor by clicking in the empty part of the Tree
5. Click on the same cell again
6. The text control appears and the cursor flashes
7. After about 50 milliseconds the text loses focus and disappears
