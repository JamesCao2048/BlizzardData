SWT.MULTI does not work for SWT Text control using Mac OS X Cocoa.

Zip file of several Java source classes.
Nothing else.
SWT.MULTI does not work for SWT Text control using Mac OS X Cocoa SWT library in one moderately complex situation which is provided.
The Java code uses SWT directly.
I am attempting to create a large editable text control (300, 300 pixels or so) with SWT.MULTI
-
Works fine with non-Cocoa 3.4 library.
Works fine without SWT.MULTI using Cocoa 3.5 library.
Breaks badly with SWT.MULTI and org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx_3.5.0.v3550b.jar.
I've attached a zip file with several classes.
I apologize that I couldn't make it smaller.
To test, put the source files into a Java project in the package named "ext".
Run main() in "ext.Test" without any parameters, specifying the above Cocoa SWT jar in the build path.
When you attempt to type characters they show up at the wrong place, outside of the control.
In source file DesktopChannel.java at line 178, uncomment the Text instantiation line to instead use only SWT.BORDER as the style, and comment out the next line using SWT.MULTI.
All works fine.
Interestingly, if you don't give focus to the Text control, it gets even stranger with SWT.MULTI.
Comment out the "c.setFocus(timeNotes);" statement at line 38 of TimeExpenseEntryFunction.java and it doesn't work at all with SWT.MULTI, but works fine without SWT.MULTI.
Again it all works fine using a non-Cocoa SWT jar.
