Components in SWT_AWT don't show in Workbench.
It you put back some of what was removed from SWT_AWT.java between M5 and M6
then things work again.  Specifically the code below.  Will also attach
a sampple plugin project that shows this.
parent.addListener (org.eclipse.swt.SWT.Resize, new
org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Listener() {
public void handleEvent( org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Event
e) {
final org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Rectangle rect =
parent.getClientArea();
java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable ()
{
public void run () {
frame.setSize (rect.width,
rect.height);
frame.validate ();
}
});
}
});
// part 4: This was just removed and is a problem.
parent.getDisplay().asyncExec(new Runnable() {
public void run () {
if (parent.isDisposed()) return;
final org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Rectangle rect =
parent.getClientArea ();
java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable ()
{
public void run () {
frame.setSize (rect.width,
rect.height);
frame.validate ();
}
});
}
});
