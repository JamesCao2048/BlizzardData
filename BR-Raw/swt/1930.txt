Text SWT.MULTI with backgroundimage don't show deleted characters
A multiline textarea with a backgroundimage does not show the deleted characters until a mouseclick out and again in the textarea.
Steps to reproduce:
1.create a textarea with SWT.MULTI, SWT.WRAP or SWT.V_SCROLL (textArea = new Text(top, SWT.MULTI  | SWT.WRAP | SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.FLAT);)
2.add a background image (textArea.setBackgroundImage(new Image(Display.getCurrent(), getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/bg.png")));)
3.at runtime add some characters
4.delete some characters with backspace or delete
--> the cursor moves back but the characters are not removed
5.click on another item
6.click back to the textarea
--> the characters are now removed
