Display#post(Event) confuses mouse buttons 2 and 3 on Cocoa
Display#post(Event) confuses mouse buttons 2 and 3 on Cocoa.
To reproduce, use Snippet142 but click the right mouse button:
event.button = 3;
The console says that button 2 has been pressed.
With button = 2, the console says button 3.
This works fine on Windows 7 and GTK.
If you change Button to Text in the snippet, you see that button 3 correctly opens the context menu.
