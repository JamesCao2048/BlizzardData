Text#getCaretLocation() replaces selected text by " " iff caret is after last character
I20051004-0800
- select the last few characters of a Text such that the caret is at the very end
- call Text#getCaretLocation()
=> Selection is replaced by a space.
=> Neither selection nor text should be changed.
This can easily be reproduced in Eclipse:
- have:
void m() {
new java.util.ArrayList();
}
- select "new java.util.ArrayList()"
- Refactor > Extract Local Variable
- press Ctrl+Space
