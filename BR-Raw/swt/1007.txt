[Browser] crash when showing text entry prompter
- crashes with xulrunner >= 1.9, previous xulrunner versions don't crash
- run Snippet128 with Browser style SWT.MOZILLA
- point it at a page with the following content:
<HTML>
<BODY>
<script>
var userName
userName = prompt("What is your name?","Name goes here")
alert(userName)
</script>
</BODY>
</HTML>
- press OK in the resulting dialog and a crash will occur (the dump shows the crash happening in the event loop)
