modified Snippet131 to show the bug
Please run attached snippet on GTK.
Do a right click on the shell, and you should get a menu where the upper half is empty.
You get arrows for scrolling the menu, if you do so, you can scroll the menu to a state, where no arrows are neccessary.
I'll attach a screenshot as well.
It is even easier to reproduce, if you increase the number of MenuItems, so that the menu doesn't fit on the screen.
This is very similar to  bug 71844 , but while I cannot reproduce it with the plugin provided there, it is reproducible with the snippet attached here.
I suppose it is the number of MenuItems which makes the difference.
