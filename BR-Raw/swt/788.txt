Code Comments in detail
1.Java
-- Create a socket and add listeners to detect keyboard events, will pop up a  NO_FOCUS shell when event detected.
2.C++
-- Create a gtk plug window, and reparent it to java socke via gtk_plug_new(), there is a button in the plug.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Java process, you could get the socket id from console
2.Launch c++ process, input the socket id you get from java console
3.Mouse click button to give plug's button the focus
4.Press "Enter" on the button.
5.Expected
-- Focus should not lost from Plug's button, because we new a NO_FOCUS shell from Java, but actually focus moved to the 2ed control of Java.
