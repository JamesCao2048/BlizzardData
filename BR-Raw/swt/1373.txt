Can't get a context menu on a tree item
Right-clicking on tree items isn't working in the 10/25 nightly build.
It _is_ working on the code editor, so  it's not completely broken, but I seem to remember this working as of Friday.
1.In any workspace, expand a project.
2.Right-click on a folder or a file
Nothing happens.
