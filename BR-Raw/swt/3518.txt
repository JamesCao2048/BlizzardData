List.getFocusIndex() does not answer -1
Run the snippet below, click on the empty list, and it prints its focus index
as 0 even though it has no items.
Same happens if you have a list with items
and then do a List.removeAll().
According to the javadoc these should answer
-
1, which is what (for instance) gtk does.
public static void main(String[] args){
Display display = new Display();
Shell shell = new Shell(display);
shell.setBounds(10,10,100,100);
final List list = new List(shell,SWT.SINGLE); // SWT.MULTI does the same
list.setBounds(10,10,80,50);
list.addListener(SWT.MouseDown, new Listener() {
public void handleEvent(Event event) {
System.out.println(list.getFocusIndex());
}
});
shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
if (!display.readAndDispatch())
display.sleep();
}
display.dispose();
}
Looking at the implementation of getFocusIndex(), I don't think that
LB_GETCARETINDEX ever answers
-1. Perhaps we should just answer
-1 whenever
the list contains no items.
