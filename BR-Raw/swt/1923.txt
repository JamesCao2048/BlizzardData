ExpandBar does not scroll properly
Build ID:  I20070625-1500
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Create an ExpandBar, with more items than what can fit the screen.
A scroll bar should automatically appear.
2.Suppose you have a disability and cannot use the mouse.
Use the arrows keys to adjust focus to each ExpandBar item.
3.The item you want is currently not on screen.
Notice that as you move focus beyond the last viewable ExpandBar item, the scroll bar does not adjust.
This is a bug.
More information:
Certain people with disabilities cannot use the mouse to access ExpandBars scrolling functionality.
Currently, there is no way for them to access items beyond the initial viewable set.
