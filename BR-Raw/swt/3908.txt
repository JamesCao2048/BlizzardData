org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.drawString() fails to draw euro sign
When you call org.swt.graphics.GC.drawString() with the text string containing
euro sign, drawString() fails to draw it and the trailing characters.
For example, if you call drawString() with 'ABC$DEF' ($ stands for euro sign),
you will have only 'ABC' rendered and '$DEF' is lost.
