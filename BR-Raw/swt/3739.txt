[StyledText] ContentWidthCache initialization
build R2.1
bug 35943  documents a problem where apparently the font/line height is 0. This
causes improper initialization of StyledText, namely of the ContentWidthCache
during setContent/reset/calculateContentWidth.
In a normal operating scenario the lineHeight should never be 0. It is
initialized in the StyledText constructor via initializeRenderer.
We may want to remove the lineHeight check in calculateContentWidth and always
initialize the line cache.
In addition we should consider adding a range check in
ContentWidthCache.calculate like it already is in ContentWidthCache.reset.
