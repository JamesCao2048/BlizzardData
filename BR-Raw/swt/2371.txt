Cheese in Tree with text that spans columns
Run Snippet240.  Resize "Column 1" to be larger.  Notice that the text in column 2 is incorrect now.  This is different from what happens in Table (see Snippet239).
The following works around the problem but has some flash:
tree.getColumn(1).addListener(SWT.Resize, new Listener() {
public void handleEvent(Event e) {
if (tree.getItemCount() > 0) {
TreeItem item = tree.getItem(0);
Rectangle bounds = item.getBounds(2);
Rectangle area = tree.getClientArea();
tree.redraw(bounds.x, area.y, bounds.width, area.height, false);
}
}
});
