computeTrim and getClientArea are inconsistent in CTabFolder
According to SWT documentation, given a desired client area, computeTrim should
return a bounding rectangle required to produce that client area. Bounding
rectangle height taken into account in CTabFolder.getClientArea (line 613) is
greater one row of pixels than the one calculated in CTabFolder.computeTrim
(line 348). This is inconsistent. It also affects the patch to fix 10025. The
workaround is to manually correct the bounds returned by computeTrim.
