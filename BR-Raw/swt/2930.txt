org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC: Transform has no effect to images with transarent colors like GIF/PNG
GC.setTransform(Transform) has no effect to those images that contain
transparent color index, like PNG and GIF.
I tested JPG, PNG (with and without transparent color index) and GIF (with
transparent index).
Transform has no effect to those transparent images.
