[GTK 3] Text alignment inside GtkLabel is invalid
When you pass to the label SWT.RIGHT, SWT.LEFT or SWT.CENTER in GTK2 it aligns Label properly, when you run same code with GTK3, it aligns label incorrectly.
To test it:
1.Open HelloWorld2.java
2. Change label constructor to this:
Label label = new Label (shell, SWT.RIGHT);
When you run with GTK2: label/imabe is aligned to the right
When you run with GTK3: it still aligned  to the left
My Findings:
Label.createHandle  line:
if you change line:
handle = gtk_box_new (OS.GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, false, 0);
to
handle = OS.gtk_hbox_new(false, 0);
It works with both GTK2 and GTK3.
If you change orientation to Vertical:
handle = gtk_box_new (OS.GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, false, 0);
it seems to work too.
Possible causes: sizing of widgets ? incorrect packing in gtk_box_new ?
