Table.getItem(Point) uses incorrect calculation on Motif
In all Motif versions of SWT, the method Table.getItem(Point) does not work
correctly if the index of the top item of the table is anything other than
zero.
Thus it does not work correctly if the table is scrolled down.
The method
will almost always return null.
The bug is in the line:
int index = (point.y
- getHeaderHeight ()) / itemHeight
- topIndex;
The final minus sign should be a plus sign.
The line should instead read:
int index = (point.y
- getHeaderHeight ()) / itemHeight + topIndex;
The method works correctly on Windows.
I have not tried GTK.
