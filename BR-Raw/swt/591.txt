AIOOBE calling IAHyperlink methods
Created  attachment 174033   [details]
test case that shows the failure
Run the attached snippet, which sets up a hyperlink listener with a name and description.
Run AccProbe, and try to look at the IAHyperlink name and description.
There is an array index out of bounds calling "method5" which is IAccessibleHyperlink::getDescription.
The number of parameters is incorrect
- it should be 2, but instead, there are 0.
