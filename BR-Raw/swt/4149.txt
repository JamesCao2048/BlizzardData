Esc traverse does not go up hierarchy
Build 20020226
I'm trying to hook Esc so that it activates the current editor.
(I tried doing this using an accelerator a while back, but that doesn't work
since it steals it from other places, e.g.
renaming a file).
I'm now trying to use a traverse listener on the shell, however it never gets
notified of Esc.
It looks like the traverse handling for Esc does not go up
the parent chain.
Is this as intended or a bug?
Is there any way for me to hook Esc from a parent widget, yet still have
children handle it if they need to?
