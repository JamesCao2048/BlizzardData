Coolbar - delete item behavior problem
Build 2.0.1 20020807.
1.Run the attached test case.
2.Press the Delete/Add button multiple times.
This removes the second item,
then adds it back.
Notice that the item is not added back in its original spot
and keeps sliding over as you press the Delete/Add button.
On Windows, this behavior does not occur.
On Linux, when the item is deleted
the space that it occuppied is added to the first item, so adding the item back
at its original spot doesn't work as expected.
The emulated behavior should be
like the Windows behavior.
