Dialog displays small sometimes in GTK
This problem seems similar to  bug 100328  but I was asked to file a new bug. The
problem is that we have a dialog that allows the user to display a child dialog.
That child dialog sometimes displays small. We have not observed this behavior
on Windows. I am using kubuntu linux with the GTK libaries
ii  kwin           3.4.0-0ubuntu1 KDE Window Manager
We are using a jface dialog and using hints on the GridData to size the
components within the dialog so are not sizing it ourselves
