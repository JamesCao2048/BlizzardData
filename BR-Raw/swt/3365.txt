[Browser] Exception error messages are not very meaningful
When using the SWT Browser in Linux it seems that the "SWTError: No more
handles" error is used for several different situations that don't really mean
there are no more handles.  This makes it very difficult to debug problems.
Would it be possible to use more meaningful errors that will help users deduce
what the real problems are?
