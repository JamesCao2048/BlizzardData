Ctrl+SPACE is not a valid keybinding assignment for actions on native widgets
The keybinding preferences should not allow you to assign CTRL+SPACE as the
keybinding to actions which are invoked when a Tree or Table has focus.
This is
the platform keybinding for toggle selection.
For example, assign Navigate->Go Into to CTRL+SPACE, and then try to invoke in
the package explorer.
It seems to work every other time and of course
interferes with platform accelerators
