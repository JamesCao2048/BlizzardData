Performance issue in Table.RemoveAll()
Method org,eclipse.swt.widgets.Table.removeAll() removes items from the
beginning of a Vector, but it should remove the items from the end instead since
Vector is shuffling the items all around the place when removed from the top.
This goes for the rest of places where all items are removed from a vector.
