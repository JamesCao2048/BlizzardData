Don't flush X exposes for a SMOOTH Sash
For a Sash that uses SWT.SMOOTH, we don't need to flush the Expose events from
the X server since we do no XOR drawing.
This will also make view resizing
smoother since we won't keep waiting for the X server.
I tried this change and I like the effects, however it may show some temporary
artifacts during resizing that may be more objectionable than the old behaviour
in some configurations.
I would like to make this change now to get feedback.
