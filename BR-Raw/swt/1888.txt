Expanding/Collapsing tree nodes in Quick Windows closes window
- on Mac open the Quick Outline on some Java CU
- expand/collapse any node wioth children
Observe: a single click expands/collapses the node *and* closes the window.
In addition single clicking on any tree item closes the window too (I'm not sure whether this is the correct behavior).
