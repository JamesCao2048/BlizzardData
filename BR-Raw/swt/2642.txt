pango_layout_context_changed called too often
StyledTextRenderer often updates the tab size of the layouts cached by
DisplayRenderer, even though they usually don't change.
Each time this is
called, it now triggers a call to pango_layout_context_changed() which
invalidates pango's line cache.
This causes pango to do a lot of work.
A possible fix is to only update the tab sizes in pango if they have actually
changed.
