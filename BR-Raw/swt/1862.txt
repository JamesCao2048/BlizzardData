Keyboard selection does not work with context menus on Leopard
Eclipse 3.3.1 on OS X 10.5 Leopard
If you bring up a context menu ... say the Source menu [Command-option-s], scroll down to say Override/Implement methods, and press enter, the action is not selected and instead, the editor gets the enter key.  I've also noticed that when you press the up and down arrows to select a menu, the editor cursor moves as well.
