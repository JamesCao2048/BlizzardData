StyledText - Printing could end pages twice
build R2.1
In StyledText.Printing.print() we have a test to see if we need to call endPage
on a partially printed page when printing is done. We also close pages while
printing lines when a full page has been printed.
The test to close a partial page could theoretically close the page again when
it was already closed based on completing a full page. The test is off by two
lines. In practice this is unlikely to happen since the page size would have to
fall right between these two lines.
The effect would be a blank page inserted after every printed page.
