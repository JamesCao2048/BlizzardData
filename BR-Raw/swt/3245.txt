Receiving duplicate key events per non-printable key [BBAWT]
Run the attached testcase on PocketPC.
Place focus on the Text widget, then
bring up the soft keyboard and press the Enter and Tab key.
What you get are 2 KeyDown events plus 1 KeyUp for the Enter key and only a
single KeyUp event (no KeyDown) for the Tab key.
For comparison, on win32, you
get a single down and up for the Enter key and nothing at all for the Tab key.
I tested this using the Windows CE (ARM PocketPC) download from eclipse.org
which more specifically is swt-3.0RC1-win32-ce-arm-ppc.zip (which is based on
version 3054).
