ExpandItem header should set cursor to CURSOR_HAND in Windows
SWT 3.2rc2, Windows XP sp2
All of the ExpandBar controls I've seen in XP visually indicate that an ExpandItem may be expanded/collapsed by changing the cursor to the hand cursor when the pointer moves over the ExpandItem's header.  The SWT version doesn't do this, but it'd be nice if it did - apart from consistency with Windows, it's really useful.
In addition, some of the Windows ExpandBars change the colour of the ExpandItem's text (and the chevron) to indicate the same thing.  The one in Control Panel does, but the one in Search Results doesn't - I think the rule could be that it should change colour unless you've explicitly specified a Color via setForeground(), but I'm not so sure on this one.
While I'm at it, I'm not sure the SWT ExpandBar can currently emulate the one in Windows Search Results in other ways: that one has both the ExpandBar's background and its ExpandItems' backgrounds set to the same Color.  I just gave this a quick try in 3.2rc2 and I end up with grey ExpandItems with a plain chevron (not the round one), and the font is suddenly different too.
