Cannot get simultaneous left and right mouse button in SWT.MouseMoveevents on Mac
Build Identifier: 3.6.1.v3659
If I attach a Listener for SWT.MouseMove events to a SWT Canvas, on Windows I can success fully query the event state mask for simultaneous left and right mouse buttons. On Mac the state mask never contains both the flag for button1 and button3. If they are clicked the same time button1 is the only one in the statemask.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Execute the attached file
2. press left, right, and both mouse buttons while moving
3. On Windows it will print "Hit!" for the last case. Not so for Mac
