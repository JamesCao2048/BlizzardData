Mouse wheel does not fire selection event on Scale
Add a selection listener the Scale in SWT Snippet 45 that prints the selection event.
If the scale is moved using a mouse drag gesture then selection events are printed.  If the mouse wheel is used to change the scale then no selection events are printed.
