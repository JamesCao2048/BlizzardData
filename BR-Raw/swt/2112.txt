List.setTopIndex() should not leave excess space at bottom
On OS X, when CCombo calls list.setTopIndex and the number of items in the drop down is smaller than visibleItemCount, the list turns on its scrollbars and ends up in a strange looking state.  There is an easy fix for this -- specifically, checking to make sure that top index <= (list.getItemCount() - visibleItemCount).  I'm attaching the one line fix for this.
