StyledText - caret does not move when widget shell is not open
build R2.0
The caret does not move horizontally when the widget has not been made visible
yet (i.e., its shell has not been opened) and API is called that should move
the caret.
To reproduce add the line
text.invokeAction(ST.COLUMN_NEXT);
to the SwtStyledTextUseCase.createWorkRegion
Observe that the caret is still at offset 0 when the user case is started. When
cursor next is pressed the caret is at offset 2.
The problem is that StyledText.showLocation returns scroll == true when
horizontal scroll was called even if the horizontal scroll does not actually
occur because the passed scroll distance is 0.
