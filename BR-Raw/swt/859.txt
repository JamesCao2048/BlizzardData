Program.findProgram("txt") returns null on Snow Leopard
findProgram does some extra work for text edit in order to be sure that the app knows how to handle the extension. On Snow Leopard the TextEdit plist file has changed and the extra checking fails.
Using LaunchServices code directly (like Carbon port) works correctly.
