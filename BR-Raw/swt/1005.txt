Form Feed (f) makes StyledText go crazy

text file with FF

A Form Feed (f, 0x0c) character makes StyledText go crazy:
- open a file containing an FF in a text editor or paste it to the CustomControlExample
- move caret to line with FF
=> StyledText content becomes right-aligned.
It goes back into place when StyledText is resized.
The editor stays mostly usable, but the current line highlighting draws cheese.

A real-life example of this can be seen in org.xml.sax.helpers.AttributesImpl from /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Classes/classes.jar: The FF is two lines after the { of the class declaration (you can't miss it when you just hold Arrow_Down).
