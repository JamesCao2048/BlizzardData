Redraw problems on resizing Tree column
Tree cell contents are not redrawing properly in 3.2M1 where:
- the tree has visible column headers, and column resizing is enabled
- only one column exists
When the right hand edge of the column is dragged leftwards, it draws over the
cell contents, but the cell is not redrawn. Some content is still visible
outside the cell.
This is a new bug which does not occur in v3.1. Illustrative screenshots to follow.
