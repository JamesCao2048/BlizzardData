Clipboard data is lost on exit (Should implement the freedesktop.org specification for clipboard management)
Build Identifier: M20100211-1343
When you quit Eclipse in X11-based systems, you lose any data that was on the clipboard. You can find more information about this bug and how to fix it at  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ClipboardPersistence .
Note: I've marked it as critical because it does cause loss of user data. However, it only causes loss of data in the uncommon use case of copy -> do not save -> quit -> paste, so downgrading the severity might be appropriate.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Pre-requisite: Machine running an X11-based window manager, without extended clipboard manager such as Klipper. Tested on Ubuntu Lucid.
1. Copy text in Eclipse. You can copy this text from IDE, help documentation, dialog boxes, or any other UI element.
2. Paste it to another window, this works as expected.
3. Quit Eclipse.
4. Try to paste, there is now nothing in the clipboard.
