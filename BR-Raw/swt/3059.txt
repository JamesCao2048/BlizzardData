DND in the FileViewer example resets tree selection
RC2
Linux-GTK
In the FileViewer example, expand the tree a few levels and drag a file from the table on the right to somewhere in the tree on the left. No matter where
the drop occurs, the selection is reset to the filesystem root. A client
application wouldn't want to lose the user's context this way. The selection
should remain on the item that was dropped onto.
