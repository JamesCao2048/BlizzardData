drop text in Text widget duplicates text
gtk 2.8.17 on FC5
swt HEAD
Take snippet78, replace the Label by Text(shell, SWT.SINGLE).
Run the snippet, selected the 'Text' from the first widget, drag and grop on the second widget.
You will get 'TextText'.
Now go on the other direction, You will get 'TextTextTextText'.
I think we have our DropTarget *AND* the native drop target from the gtkentry in action here.
VI: Correct me if I'm wrong.
The framework you added to Control#gtk_button_press_event, Text#dragDetect is there specifically to stop the native drag, right ?
(Isn't here any easy way to do it?
Like return 1 in the drag_data_get or drag_start?)
If you need code to stop the native drag.
Where is the code to stop the native drop ?
is it not need ?
