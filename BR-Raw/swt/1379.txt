[flex-hierarchy] Mac: Using down arrow to quickly move down some tree controls causes them to jump back to top
Build ID: I20071101-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Mac only.
I have not seen this happen on Windows; I have not tried Linux.
2.This is a timing-sensitive bug, so you need to set your keyboard repeat rate to the fastest it will go, under Mac's System Preferences > Keyboard & Mouse.
3.In Eclipse, make a new Java project, and add this sample code:
public class J {
public static void main(String[] args) {
nest(0);
}
private static void nest(int i) {
if (i<200)
nest(i+1);
else {
Integer[] m = new Integer[100];
for (int j=0; j<100; ++j) {
m[j] = new Integer(j);
}
System.out.println("Breakpoint here");
}
}
}
4.Set a breakpoint on the "Breakpoint here" line, and debug.
5.In the Variables view, click on the disclosure triangle to expand array "m"
6.Click on the first array element.
7.Press and hold the keyboard's down-arrow to move down the array at full speed.
Actual result:
It will scroll correctly for a while
-- perhaps 20 or 40 elements
-- and then suddenly the selection will jump all the way back to the top of the Variables view.
It will then continue down, getting farther than it did the first time, but then eventually will jump to the top again.
Once you have made it to the bottom of the list, and all the elements have been read in, all navigation within the list will function correctly.
Expected results:
Selection continues to move down until it reaches the end of the array.
8.Try the same thing in the "Debug" view.
I have had less luck reproducing the problem there, but I have seen it on occasion.
I don't think this bug has anything to do with the debugger; I suspect it is a JFace or SWT issue.
More information:
This does not reproduce every time, but I can get it to happen fairly easily.
It is similar to  bug 185673 , but is not the same bug.
That one has been fixed; this one still reproduces.
(This one also reproduced in 3.3, but I don't think it reproduced in 3.2; I may be wrong about that though.)
Bug 185673  had to do with preservingSelection() in TreeViewer.replace(); it seems like this one might involve that code as well, because the behavior
-- jumping to the top of the list
-- is similar.
I find that the problem reproduces most easily after restarting Eclipse.
So if it reproduces for you but then stops reproducing, try restarting.
