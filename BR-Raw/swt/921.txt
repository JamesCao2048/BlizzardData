[swt-win32] System menu of a NO_TRIM shell on Task Bar
Build ID: I20090611-1540
Steps To Reproduce:
A NO_TRIM shell has no system menu on the task bar, the shell does not yet react to ALT+F4, which closes the shell on MS Windows.
but we almost always need that if the shell has an entry in the task bar.
