The file search provides a search history. Using the cursor up/down keys you can scroll through the history.
After activating the "Regular expression" checkbox, you can use the "Content Assist", e.g. by pressing <ctrl>-<space>.
Now, using the the cursor up/down keys, you can scroll through the completion proposals.
But, this also scrolls through the search history. Your new search query gets messed up ...
Same happens with page up/down, but not with the <end> or <pos1> keys or with the mouse.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. fill the file search history with some (different) search strings
2. activate the "Regular Expression" checkbox
3. activate the "code assist" using <ctrl>-<space>
4. use the cursor up or down key to scroll through the different proposals
