setBackground of text redraw incorrect with xp style
When using the XP style the Text widget seems to fill a rectangle smaller than
the allocated area for the Text widget.  When setting the background color it
has a small gutter inside the border that the color wasn't applied to.  It can
be remedied by mousing over the widget or when the window is redrawn.  I'll
attach sample code and screen shots of the behavior.
