[SWT Mac OS X] path.addString does not appear to handle unicode properly
Build Identifier: Version: 4.2.0 Build id: I20111209-2100
In an attempt to render Japanese Kanji characters (which are essentially Chinese Han characters) using SWT's Path#addString, I discovered that none of them were rendering properly. As an example, the kanji for the number 5 instead renders as what appears to be "<". Note that this only applies to Path#addString and not to GC#drawString, which renders kanji characters properly.
I will attach a screen shot and the code to reproduce it.
Note that I have attempted to run the code I will attach to this bug on a different platform (Linux x86_64, Version: 3.7.0 Build id: I20110613-1736), and it works properly; that is, both lines show the kanji character, none show the "<". This is therefore almost certainly a platform-specific issue.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Execute the code I will attach with the SWT library.
2. Observe that the two lines output on the shell which appears do not output the same character; one of them is incorrectly what appears to be "<".
