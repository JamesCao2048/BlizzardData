1 - Run the Car's coolbar example on:
/Car/coolbartest/CoolBarIconTest.java
2 - Resize the window to be bigger
3 - Drag the last Item to the next row
4 - Remove the Item on index 5 (ie. the item that you just dragged)
5 - The coolbar do not resize, so there is a extra row empty where you just
removed the item.
