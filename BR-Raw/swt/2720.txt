[Browser] Clicking in web browser (editor) does not dismiss fast view
If I have a fast view open, and I click in a regular editor or other view, the
fast view correctly gets dismissed.
However, if I have an internal browser widget editor open and I click in it, the
fast view does not get dismissed, and I have to click in some otehr view to get
it dismissed.
