[Program] Program.findProgram does not pick up customized applications for file extensions
Program.findProgram always seems to use the Open action for a file extension,
even if the user has selected a different program using "Open With->Choose
Program" in Windows Explorer and saying "Always use the selected program to
open this kind of file".
It isn't obvious to me where this customization is stored in the registry so
that findProgram could check for it.
The customization is apparent in Folder Options:File Types accessible from the
Windows Explorer Tools menu.
If you look at an extension that has been
customized, you'll see a "Restore" button rather than the "Advanced" button.
Is there a workaround?
