Shell focus problems after closing sub-dialog
I20100516-0800 Cocoa (works fine on WinXP)
Steps in the SDK:
- in a new project, open Properties dialog and go to the Builders page
- click New
- click OK
- click OK
- double-click the newly created Ant builder
- click Cancel
=> now, the Properties dialog is broken:
- Tab or Ctrl+Tab don't move the focus
- when you Command+Tab to another application, the Properties dialog still looks active (colored trim buttons), but it isn't. When you try to Command+Tab back to the dialog, it doesn't take focus.
- when you try to click OK or Cancel, the first click does not press the button. But the second click works as expected.
I didn't find a good pattern to tell where or why this happens, but it happens consistently for some dialogs. Another case in the SDK is when you add a resource filter and then double-click to edit a filter.
