Bug 29274 – Surface non-java projects as model non-java resources
Build 2.1 M4
From EG's note:
Now that more projects that we work with do not have the java nature (e.g.
an
update-site project, the documentation project) it becomes more annoying that
the PackageExplorer doesn't show non-Java projects.
The JavaCore API already supports to get at non-Java resources inside a
JavaProject.
I was therefore wondering whether we could also surface a
corresponding JavaModel .getNonJavaResources or JavaModel.getNonJavaProjects.
Similarly the delta would be handled in the same ways as for non-Java resources.
I did a quick prototype by just surfaceing IProjects in the PackageExplorer as
well.
It works pretty well, with the exception of the deltas.
