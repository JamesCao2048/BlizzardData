Bug 384595 – [1.8] Modifiers other than final or annotations should not be accepted for lambda formal parameter list
BETA_JAVA8
package p;
interface I {
}
public class Action<T> {
public void f1(static Object o) {}
public void foo() {
I in = (final int x, static strictfp public Object o) -> x;
}
}
here the lambda expression should have an error similar to the error at f1, according to JLS 15.27.1 (The syntax for formal parameters with declared types is the same as the syntax for the parameters of a method declaration (8.4.1))
ECJ currently accepts all modifiers
