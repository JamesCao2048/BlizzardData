Bug 420038 – [1.8][compiler] Tolerate illegal type annotations on array dimensions of class literals for now for compatibility.
BETA_JAVA8:
The following program is tolerated by javac 8b108;
// --
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;
@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface T {
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Class<?> c = int @T [].class;
}
}
I believe oracle compiler is definitely at fault - this issue has been reported
to them  until we hear confirmtion, we should turn our error into warning for now.
