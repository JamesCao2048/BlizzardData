Bug 385132 – [1.8][compiler] syntax error says "ARROW" or "COLON_COLON" where it shouls say "->" or "::"
If one of the new tokens '->' or '::' is misplaced the compiler currently
reports
Syntax error on token "ARROW", ...
Syntax error on token "COLON_COLON", ...
For all other tokens it shows the token verbatim, not by its name.
I found that this is caused by failure to list these tokens in the $names
section of the grammar (at the very bottom).
Adding these lines fixes the issue:
ARROW ::= '->'
COLON_COLON ::= '::'
