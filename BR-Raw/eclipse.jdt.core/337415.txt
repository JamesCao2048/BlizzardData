Bug 337415 – External folders project is not created
Created attachment 189164 [details]
Workspace for recreation steps
When the preferences and the project are imported using ANT script, the external folders project is not created causing potentially dangerous behavior (f.e.
no delta can be computed, so each build is a full build).
The steps to reproduce the behavior are:
1.
Import the projects from attached zip file
2.
Inside the Data project there are two launch configurations.
3.
Execute the "Headless Import"
4.
Refresh the Data project.
runtimeData folder contains new workspace, check in the .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.core if the external folders project exists.
Two other projects are ant tasks responsible for loading the preferences and importing the project.
The second launch configuration ("Verification") launches Eclipse which uses the same workspace as the headless one, so it is possible to check if the classpath variable has been correctly loaded.
