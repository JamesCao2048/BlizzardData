Bug 14597 – rearrange source code
hello,
I would suggest the following feature ; be able to rearrange the source code.
Why this feature? For instance you sorted your method view in the java browsing
perspective to have the methods in alphabetic order.
You add then a method .
Presently, it will be inserted in the source code where you write the code.
The
rearrange feature would enable the user to place its method automatically in
the right place.
regards
Xavier
