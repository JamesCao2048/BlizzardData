Bug 429279 – [1.8][index] Java 8 search support degrades indexing performance.
Manoj has collected some profiles that show that ~70% of time spent
in indexing goes into the new method SourceIndex.indexedResolvedDocument.
We need to find ways to speed this up:
Some obvious candidates looking at the profile (Manoj - please attach)
- Disabling task tag processing
- Setting a bit in those methods that have a functional type and only
populating those methods's bodies in the parse tree (others will have the
skeleton built by diet parser)
etc.
