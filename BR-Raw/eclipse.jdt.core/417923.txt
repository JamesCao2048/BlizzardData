Bug 417923 – [1.8][dom ast] white space requirements for ArrayType NASTFlattener and ASTRFlattener
In the ArrayType implementation specify the white space requirements
Ref bug 413569 comment 18 last two items (reproduced below)
- ASTRewritingStatementsTest file, testBug400568_a_since_8 has two additional white spaced after removal of annotations on dimensions.
To be changed?
- TypeAnnotationsConverterTest -  String [] [] [] [] - do we need these spaces if there are no annotations on dimensions?
