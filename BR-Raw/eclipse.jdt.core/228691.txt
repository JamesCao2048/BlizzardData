Bug 228691 – JDT impl of com.sun.mirror.util.Types.isAssignable() returns false for wrapper to primitive assignment
Created attachment 97473 [details]
Jar file with annotation processor.
Build ID: M20080221-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Enable annotation processing on a current project.
2.
Add the attached jar file to the annotation processing path.
3.
See the errors.
4.
Run the same code with Sun's apt, which correctly allows wrapper to primitive assignment.
More information:
The issue here is that Types.isAssignable is returning false when passed a ClassType of "java.lang.Integer" and a PrimitiveType of Kind "INT", respectively.
 Types should correspond to what's acceptable at the *source* level, not at the binary level for four reasons:
1.
 The annotations occur in the source, and are annotating source transformations.
2.
 According to the "Overview" section of he Mirror API, it's intended to model the language, as opposed to the VM structures.
 At the language level, autoboxing and unboxing now allows both int -> Integer and Integer -> int (and of course, the other primitives as well).
 Types.isAssignable() should allow that assignment.
3.
 It's consistent with the reference APT implementation.
4.
 Types.isSubtype() is an appropriate method to use when the opposite meaning is desired.
