Bug 110596 – [assist] don't rank java.lang types lower if a simple name duplicate exists
3.2 M2
TYPE_REF proposal ranking...
I noticed that String is ranked lower than StringBuffer and (worse!)
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in the following situation (| = caret):
class X {
St|
}
which is especially unlucky in this situation:
class X {
CharSequence cs= St|
}
Since I cannot refine the proposal list any further by typing in more characters
(since String is a prefix of the higher-ranked proposals), this means the only
way to select the proposal is by using the arrow keys / mouse.

The reason why String is ranked lower is that there are other types in the type
universe that have the same simple name, which causes the
AcceptedType.mustBeQualified flag to come true.
This seems "unjust" for
java.lang types.
Types that do not require imports should be treated almost like
already imported types.
