Bug 43212 – catch variable not recognized by code-completion
3.0 I20030916
The following code does not work with code-completion.
The exception 'e' doesn't
seem to be resolved so that when I type 'e.' + ctrl+space there are no
suggestions given.
However, if I type a method name I know exists and save the
file compiles without errors.
Here is the snippet of code that causes problems:
public class AnonymousClassTest {
private Job fetchLogEntriesJob = new
Job(Policy.bind("HistoryView.fetchHistoryJob")) { //$NON-NLS-1$
private ICVSFile remoteFile;
public void setRemoteFile(ICVSFile file) {
this.remoteFile = file;
}
public IStatus run(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
try {
remoteFile.getLogEntries(monitor);
} catch (TeamException e) {
====> this line doesn't resolve ===> return e.;
}
return Status.OK_STATUS;
}
};
}
