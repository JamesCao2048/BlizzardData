Bug 406392 – [1.8][compiler][codegen] Improve identification of lambdas that must capture enclosing instance
BETA_JAVA8:
For the ER described by the bug 406319, we need to reliably identify those
lambda methods that cannot be static.
Presently the "method can be static"
diagnostics and analysis still has some issues and can stand for further
clean up: See that in the following program we don't suggest that foo could
be static when in fact it could be:
// ----
public class X  {
int f;
void foo() {
class Y {
int p;
{
class Z {
int f = p;
}
}
};
}
}
