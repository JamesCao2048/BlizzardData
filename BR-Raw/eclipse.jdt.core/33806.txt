Bug 33806 – Code assist failure: assignment of double in for loop hides previous variables
Build id: 200302270800
The following code exhibits a code assist failure due to the assignment of the
double variable inside the for loop.
 Any attempts I made to reduce the test
case further made code assist work, so I assume that this is nearly the smallest
test case.
On the line after the "/* code assist here */" comment attempt code assist on
"loc", "ba", or "fie" (should return "local", "bar", and "field" respectively).
All will fail, it appears as though the for loop + double is tripping up the
code completion engine.
public class Test {
Object field;
public void foo() {
Object local= null;
double bar= 0;
for (;;) {
bar = (double)1;
}
/* code assist here */
}
}
