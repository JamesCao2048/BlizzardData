Bug 10499 – DOM/AST: need a way to access the IMethodBinding of a ClassInstanceCreation
Build 20020226
How do I access the IMethodBinding of the constructor represented by a
ClassInstanceCreation node ? We need this method binding since a constructor
can throw exceptions.
I think there should be a method resolveBinding() -> IMethodBinding.
