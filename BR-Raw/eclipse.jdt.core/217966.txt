Bug 217966 – Flags#toString API deserves improvements
Source based, v_835.
On the documentation front:
- this refers to JLS2, which is dated;
- this is talking about public, private etc.
as flags, whereas the language
spec calls them modifiers;
- the notion of 'standard string representation' is somewhat odd since the same
doc must confess that the ordering of modifiers, while inspired from the JLS,
is a design choice (it is compatible with the spec, but the spec does not
prescribe a fixed order).
On the design front, the need for the API client to modify the flags when they come from a method is clumsy.
There might be better solutions, but passing an extra parameter that tells which type of element the flags come from and reacting to it would be an obvious first step.
