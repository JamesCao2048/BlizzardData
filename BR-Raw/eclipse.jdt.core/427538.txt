Bug 427538 – [1.8][infrastructure] Enable CompletionTests18 & ResolveTests18 to run with rtstubs18.jar
Presently writing completion and selection tests from user provided problem
snippets is a pain because these tests run against minimal version of libraries
(JCLMIN) that don't even have java.lang.String in some incarnations of them.
For example given:
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
public class Bug419048 {
void test1(List<Person> roster) {
Map<String, Person> map =
roster
.stream()
.collect(
Collectors.toMap(
p -> p.getLast(), //[1]
p -> p            //[2]
));
}
}
one needs to transform all the symbols that originate from JRE into local
types or otherwise rewrite the test into shape.
Historically the UI project has maintained their some of their tests against
a stubbed version of JRE and recently Markus created the JDK8 version of it.
See http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=4505fb3550ef580808061e75a5a925cfe9d3b9d2
We need CompletionTests18 and ResolveTests18 to similarly run against
a version of library that has all the types in tact (but for method
bodies which are stubbed out) to make it easy to write tests.
