Bug 177683 – NPE in internal.util.Factory.createErrorClassType()
There are several methods in org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.internal.util.Factory such as createErrorClassType(), createErrorInterfaceType(), etc.
 These methods are implemented like this:
public static ClassType createErrorClassType(final ITypeBinding binding)
{
return createErrorClassType(binding.getName());
}
The problem is that the caller (e.g., MethodDeclarationImpl) may be calling the method precisely because the binding is null.
We need to search for calls to these Factory methods and figure out whether a different (known non-null) binding can be passed in or whether the Factory methods should be null-protected (e.g., if null, use some standard name).
This bug is present in v3.1.2, 3.2.2, and 3.3.
