Bug 23573 – AST: clone & source locations
20020911
This isn't specifed, so my questions: Are source locations also copied to a
cloned node (using ASTNode.copySubtrees) ?
It seems to be for some but not all nodes.
I would be happy if the source locations are copied.
(The spec says that properties are not copied; what of course makes sense).
