Bug 420084 – [1.8] static interface method cannot be resolved without receiver when imported statically
This is already allowed for static method imports from classes and the same should be allowed from interfaces too.
Consider these two units:
--------------------
package a.b;
public interface J {
static int foo(){return 0;}
}
--------------------
package a;
import static a.b.J.foo;
public interface I {
static int call() {
return foo();
}
}
--------------------
Invocation of foo() is rejected with the following error but should not be:
This static method of interface J can only be accessed as J.foo
