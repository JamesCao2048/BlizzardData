Bug 432605 – [1.8] Incorrect error "The type ArrayList<T> does not define add(ArrayList<T>, Object) that is applicable here"
Created attachment 241880 [details]
An excerpt showing the error
The attached code fails to compile with ECJ but compiles successfully using javac.
Some type information appears to be lost in the nested method call because extracting part of it into a new local variable makes the error go away.
Tested using Eclipse SDK
Version: Luna (4.4)
