Bug 334652 – Javadoc content not found for non-static inner class constructors
We have an eclipse product where we have projects that have java
build paths that include a Classpath Container that directs out to an external
jar.
The classpath container code attaches javadoc to that jar, and we have a
class like this:
package some.package:
public class SomeException extends Exception
public abstract class SomeClass
public final class InnerClass extends SomeException
when our end-users are typing
InnerClass ic = new InnerClass([CTRL-SPACE]
they just see arg0, arg1 and no javadoc.
Note that the CLASS javadoc for InnerClass appears as they hover over the type
string "InnerClass".
If they hover over the "new InnerClass" portion, they will
see:
some.package.SomeClass.InnerClass.InnerClass(SomeClass arg0, String arg1,
String arg2)
which might be where the trouble stems from; technically, yes, the first
argument is the pointer to the containing class, but shouldn't the javadoc
layer know to unwind that? (I can look at the html file on disk that the
javadoc setting resolves to and I can see the constructor documentation in the
html)
I ventured an educated guess that this might be related to bug 151500 but was asked to file separately.
