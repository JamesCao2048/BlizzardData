Bug 453635 – [compiler][null] Update NullReferenceImplTests and friends
Bug 453483 requires changes to the bit operations in UnconditionalFlowInfo.
This routinely requires verification using NullReferenceImplTests (which are not part of regular builds & tests).
The test harness given there and in NullReferenceImplTransformations supports several strategies for updating and comparing these elements:
- a human readably description of all transitions in each of the major bit operations (as comments)
- a hex-encoded tabular definition of those transitions
- the current implementation of those operations
Additionally, karnaugh maps can be created for developing more compact implementations.
It turns out, that tests and implementation have slightly diverged, thus reducing the feasibility of comparisons:
- tabular definitions are incomplete.
Based on a notion of transitive closure one state (0x1C) was considered unreachable, but previous bugs have proven this to be wrong - perhaps due to added UFI-operations that do not participate in the implementation tests.
Operation mergedWith was already amended, the others still have to follow suite.
- tabular definitions as well as textual description (comments) are not ordered in the same way as the generator output, making it difficult to compare whether definitions re-generated from the current implementation match to the previously captured definitions.
- re-generating definitions marks all textual descriptions of ThreeDimensionalTransformation (incl.
subclass) as "CHECK", because it is not correctly detected when a transition actually matches the previous tabular form.
