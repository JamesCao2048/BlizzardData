Bug 405066 – [1.8][compiler][codegen] Implement code generation infrastructure for JSR335.
BETA_JAVA8:
This ER will be used to implement the infrastructure support for generating
code for lambda expressions and method references.
Among other things:
We need to add capability to generate:
- ConstantPool sections for MethodHandles, MethodType, InvokeDynamic
- Attribute section for BootStrapMethods
- Adding of InnerClass reference for MethodHandles.Lookup
The patch at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=400875 has
support for these.
The infrastructure portion needs to be separated out,
reviewed and released.
