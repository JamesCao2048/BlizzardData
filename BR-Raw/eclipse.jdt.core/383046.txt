Bug 383046 – [1.8][compiler] Error getting reported on the lambda expression if there is a subsequent parse error
###
interface IX{
public void foo();
}
public class X {
IX i = () -> 42;
int
}
###
In this test case, there is an expected error at the incomplete int.
However, there is also an error on the correct lambda expression.
