Bug 399770 – [1.8][compiler] Implement support for @FunctionalInterface
BETA_JAVA8:
Per 9.6.3.8 FunctionalInterface [New]
The annotation type FunctionalInterface is used to indicate that an interface is meant to be a functional interface (9.8).
If an interface is annotated with the annotation @FunctionalInterface but is not, in fact, a functional interface, a compile-time error occurs.
This facilitates early detection of inappropriate method declarations appearing in or inherited by an interface that is meant to be functional.
Because some interfaces are functional incidentally, it is not necessary or desirable that all functional interfaces be annotated with the @FunctionalInterface annotation.
