Bug 420041 – [1.8] @Deprecated on an annotation type not preserved in generated class file
1.
Have an annotation and it's container as below in a project, let's say A:
@Deprecated
public @interface FooContainer {
Foo[] value();
}
@Repeatable(FooContainer.class)
public @interface Foo {
}
2.
In the same project have this in another unit:
@FooContainer({@Foo(), @Foo()})
public class Main {
}
You see the deprecated warning about FooContainer.
3.
Create another project whose build path includes the bin folder of project 'A'
4.
Create a similar class in the new project as step 2.
5.
Notice no warning about FooContainer being deprecated.
