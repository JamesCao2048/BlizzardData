Bug 23162 – DOM: clients should be able to control if bindings are available even if AST is modified
2.x
Now that we have AST rewriting we more and more start to modify existing ASTs.
After the first modification all bindings associated with nodes are null.
Since
we want to walk the tree and modifiy it in parallel clients should be able to
create an AST that keeps bindings even if the AST gets modified.
New nodes
simply don't return bindings.
