Bug 497603 – [compiler][inference] type inference bug
Created attachment 262999 [details]
example code
The attached code does not compile with ECJ in 4.6: "Type mismatch: cannot convert from Iterator<Object> to Iterator<Iterator<String>>"
However, it compiles fine with javac 1.8.0_92 (and used to compile with ECJ 4.5).
