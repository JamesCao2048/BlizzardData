Bug 31230 – Code assist on variable names: uses prefix and suffix together
20030106
1.
configure the field prefix to 'f', and the suffix to '_m'
2.
code assist on private Vector
-> fVector_m
I think a better solution would be if code assist offers several suggestions:
fVector, vector_m, vector, (fVector_m)
I think it is important that also the non-prefixed field is suggested.
(vector)
