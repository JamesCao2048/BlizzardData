Bug 414380 – [compiler][internal] QualifiedNameReference#indexOfFirstFieldBinding does not point to the first field
Trying to find the token and sourcePosition that correspond to QNR#binding I wanted to use QNR#indexOfFirstFieldBinding but observed that this field is reassigned for *every* field in the chain.
So either the name or the usage of this field is wrong.
In bug 392384 I'm temporarily adding another field indexOfFirstFirstFieldBinding so I can test that errors are reported at the desired location.
That change may need to be reverted via this bug.
