Bug 421536 – [1.8][compiler] Verify error with small program when preserved unused variables is off.
BETA_JAVA8:
The following program triggers a verify error: Inconsistent stackmap frames at branch target 9, Current frame's stack size doesn't match stackmap.
// --
interface I {
I foo();
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
I i = () -> null;
} catch (NullPointerException npe) {}
}
}
// --
The try/catch blocks seem to be required to reproduce.
