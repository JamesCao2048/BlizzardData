Bug 427216 – [Java8] array to varargs regression
I'm using the experimental Java 1.8 support via http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT/Eclipse_Java_8_Support_(BETA)
One of the daily updates this week broke basic array to vararg method calls:
public class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
foo(args); // ok in 1.7 and 1.8
foo(java.util.Arrays.asList("1").toArray(new String[0])); // broke in 1.8 somewhere this week
}
private static void foo(String...
args) { }
}
Error message (there's only a Runtime error, it compiles fine):
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.util.List.toArray([Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;
at Test.main(Test.java:8)
Workaround: Add a cast.
E.g.: (String[]) in this case.
I did regular updates last week, and this week only on Friday.
So I unfortunately can't say which update caused the regression.
It would be great if the 1.8 update channel kept older versions so people can downgrade again if necessary.
