Bug 382355 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler accepts erroneous default method
BETA_JAVA8:
The following program should be rejected since an default method is never
allowed to be override-equivalent with a public instance method of the
class Object (as it is pointless since it will never be chosen for dispatch
ever).
It is not rejected as of now.
//----------
interface I {
public String toString () default { return "";}
}
