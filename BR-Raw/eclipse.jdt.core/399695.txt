Bug 399695 – [1.8][compiler] migrate parser to other syntax for default methods
Looking at a 0.6.1 spec I finally can see that the parser work around bug 380194 comment 4 is now obsolete:
We need to move from
void foo() default { stmts; }
to
default void foo() { stmts; }
sigh.
At least this might in turn obsolete bug 383973, let's see.
