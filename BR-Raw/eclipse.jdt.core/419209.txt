Bug 419209 – [1.8] Repeating container annotations should be rejected in the presence of annotation it contains
The spec says:
It is a compile-time error if a declaration is annotated with any annotations of
a repeatable annotation type T and more than one annotation of the containing
annotation type of T.
Assuming FooContainer is itself a repeatable annotation type with a containing
annotation type of FooContainerContainer, one might expect the following code to be legal:
@Foo(1) @FooContainer({@Foo(2)}) @FooContainer({@Foo(3)}) class A {}
But this code is allowed by eclipse compiler.
