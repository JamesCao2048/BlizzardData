Bug 400745 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler incorrectly allows shadowing of local class names.
BETA_JAVA8:
Amends to JLS7 read:
"It is a compile-time error if the name of a local class C is used to declare a new local class within the scope of C, unless the new local class is declared in the body of C or within another class whose declaration is within the scope of C."
So the following program should be rejected, but is not.
// --------
interface I {
void foo();
}
public class X {
void foo() {
class Y {};
I i = ()  -> {
class Y {};
};
}
}
// ---
javac complains:
X.java:9: error: class Y is already defined in method foo()
class Y {};
