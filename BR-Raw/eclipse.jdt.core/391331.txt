Bug 391331 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler should replicate annotations with mixed SE7 & SE8 targets
BETA_JAVA8:
From EDR draft section 2.3:
@Target({ ElementType.TYPE_USE, ElementType.METHOD })
public @interface SillyAnnotation {  }
If @SillyAnnotation were written before a non-void method, then the
annotation would apply to both the return type and the method declaration.
The annotation appears twice in the AST during annotation processing,
and it appears twice in the classfile.
...
If you write @SillyAnnotation
on a void-returning method, then it applies only to the declaration,
because it is not written in a type annotation position.
We need to add support for this part of the specification.
