Bug 403147 – [compiler][null] FUP of bug 400761: consolidate interaction between unboxing, NPE, and deferred checking
Bug 400761 has introduced some more diagnostics for NPE due auto-unboxing.
This solution should be checked for completeness in two dimensions:
- are all relevant AST nodes covered?
- does the analysis create correct results within (nested) control structures that demand deferred checking?
Hopefully, this will also simplify the code a bit, by reducing code duplication.
