Bug 426652 – [1.8][inference] inference loops infinitely on unconstrained inference variable
On this example:
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.toList;
public class Y {
Object o = toList();
}
inference never terminates, because some inference variable has neither lower nor upper bounds, and hence no progress is made during resolution.
One could argue, that this rule
* Otherwise, where Î±i has proper upper bounds U1, ..., Uk, Ti = glb(U1, ..., Uk).
implicitly includes the case of k=0, where glb() is probably assumed to answer j.l.Object.
