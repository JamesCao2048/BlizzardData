Bug 402812 – [1.8][completion] Code Completion problems with static/default interface methods.
BETA_JAVA8:
Java 8 allows code carrying methods in interfaces in the form of static methods (not inherited by subtypes even though public; They can be accessed only
statically using the declaring interface's type reference.) and default instance
methods.
There are various issues in completing on these method names as shown
by the snippet below:  | indicates cursor position.
// ---
interface I {
static void staticMethod() {}
default void defaultMethod() {
stat|  // no proposals here
}
}
public class X implements I {
public void foo(I i) {
i.defaultMethod(); // proposal for defaultMethod offered here
I.stat|  // no proposals here.
this.d| // no proposals here.
}
}
