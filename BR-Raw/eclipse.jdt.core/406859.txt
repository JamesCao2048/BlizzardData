Bug 406859 – [1.8][compiler] Bad hint that method could be declared static
BETA_JAVA8:
In the following program, the compiler hints the user that X.foo could
be declared as static.
This is wrong and will result in the code not
continuing to compile:
// ---
interface I {
void foo(int i);
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
X x = null;
I i = x::foo;
try {
i.foo(10);
} catch (NullPointerException npe) {
System.out.println(npe.getMessage());
}
}
int foo(int x) {
return x;
}
}
