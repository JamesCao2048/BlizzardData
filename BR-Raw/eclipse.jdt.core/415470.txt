Bug 415470 – [1.8][compiler] Type annotations on class declaration go vanishing
BETA_JAVA8:
When the following program is compiled:
// --
import java.lang.annotation.*;
import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.*;
@Target({TYPE_USE}) @interface TypeAnnotation { }
@Target({TYPE}) @interface Annotation { }
@Annotation @TypeAnnotation class X {
}
// --
@TypeAnnotation does not seem to make it to the class file.
JSR308, section 2.3 expressly allows such usage.
Excerpt:
"A type annotation (one meta-annotated with @Target(ElementType.TYPE USE))
is permitted to be written anywhere @Target(ElementType.TYPE) or
@Target(ElementType.TYPE PARAMETER) would permitâ€”that is, on a class,
interface, or enum declaration, or on a type parameter declaration.
Strictly
speaking, these are declaration sites, not uses of a type.
However, it is
convenient to write a type annotation at a type declaration, as shorthand
for applying it at all uses.
For example, @Interned class MyClass { ...
} could
indicate that all uses of MyClass are interned, even though for other classes
some instances may be interned and other instances not interned."
