Bug 488441 – [content assist] Substring proposals have incorrect relevance
public class Try18 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
n|
}
}
- Press ctrl+space after 'n'.
=> Proposal for 'main(..)' (substring proposal) has a higher relevance than some other Types starting with 'n'.
----------------------------
public class Try18 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
y|
}
}
- Press ctrl+space after 'y'.
=> Proposal for 'Try18' (substring proposal) has a higher relevance than other Types starting with 'y'.

Substring proposals should always be less relevant than applicable prefix proposals.
