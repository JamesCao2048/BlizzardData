Bug 383949 – [1.8][compiler] Explicit this parameter illegal in lambda expressions
BETA_JAVA8:
The following program is illegal, but compiles as of now:
// ----------
interface I {
int foo(X x);
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
I i = (X this) -> 10;
}
}
In a lambda, 'this' has the same meaning as in surrounding context.
While bug 382727 would also fix this, there is value in special casing
this and issuing a more specific message:
"Explicit "this" parameter declaration is illegal on lambda expressions"
