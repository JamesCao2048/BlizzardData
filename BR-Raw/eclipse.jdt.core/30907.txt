Bug 30907 – Code assist doesn't work in first case statement of a switch statement
Using 0129, try the following test case:
1) Create a new Java Project P.
2) In P, create the following interface:
public interface Inter {
int INT = 0;
int FLOAT = 1;
}
3) In P, create the following class:
public class A {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int i = 0;
switch(i) {
case Int<cursor here>
}
}
}
Try to use the code assist where <cursor here> is located.
You won't have any
completion.
Now replace:
case Int<cursor here>
with:
case Inter.INT:
case Int<cursor here>:
And using the code assist again, you will got some completions.
I should be able
to get the same completions the first time.
This is pretty annoying.
From my perspective, this needs to be fixed for 2.1.
