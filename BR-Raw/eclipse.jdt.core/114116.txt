Bug 114116 – [assist] name suggestion for collections
3.2M2
code completiom nicely suggests names for arrays:
Report[] <--CODE ASSIST> will suggest reports
it would be nice if it worked for collections too.
Set<Report> <--CODE ASSIST>  suggests set which is not useful.
reports would be
much better.
I do understand that colletions are not any special from other generic classes
and only some generics are containers but the collections are much more used and
having this completion would be very useful.
