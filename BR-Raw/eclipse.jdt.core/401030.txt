Bug 401030 – [1.8][null] Null analysis support for lambda methods.
BETA_JAVA8:
This may be broken.
LambdaExpression.resolveType is an amalgam of
MethodScope.createMethod
SourceTypeBinding.resolveTypesFor
AbstractMethodDeclaration.resolve
I may not have hooked up all portions needed for null inheritance/analysis
since some of this code was too dependent on the method binding having an
associated AbstractMethodDeclaration.
In particular, the call to SourceTypeBinding.createArgumentBindings is
not there.
Please see Scope.isLambdaScope, Scope.isLambdaSubscope, scope.namedMethodScope
et al which may help with an alternate implementation.
