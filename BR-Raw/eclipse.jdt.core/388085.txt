Bug 388085 – [1.8][compiler] Type annotations on a wildcard type argument are not supported
From the JSR 308 specification:
"An annotation on a wildcard type argument appears before the wildcard, as in MyClass<@Immutable ? extends
Comparable<MyClass>>."
This needs to be supported by the ECJ.
A simpler example is:
class MyClass<@Immutable ? extends Object> {}
