Bug 29621 – Wrong Delta When Adding to Filtered Folder
Build I20030115
1.
Start fresh workspace
2.
Add J project "Test"
3.
Add source folder "src"
4.
Add folder "icons" to "src"
5.
Ensure only "src" is on the build path and exclude folder "icons"
6.
Add file "my.txt" to "icons" folder
==> the delta which is sent out looks like:
Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN}
Test[*]: {CHILDREN}
src/icons/my.txt[+]: {}
There should be a resource delta.
