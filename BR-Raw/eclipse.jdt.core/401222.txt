Bug 401222 – [1.8][compiler] Conditional operator expressions results differ from 8b76
For the program below javac 8b76 reports:
C:\jtests>C:\lambda-8-b76-windows-x64-05_feb_2013\jdk1.8.0\bin\javac -cp c:\jtes
ts X.java
X.java:5: error: incompatible types: bad type in conditional expression; int can
not be converted to List<String>
List<String> l = x== 2 ? (List<String>)(null) : 1;
^
1 error
while eclipse BETA_JAVA8 head and javac7 report that Object cannot be
converted to List<String>
This difference needs to be investigated.
