Bug 385293 – [1.8][compiler] compiler accepts normal modifiers on type arguments
Type references like
T<final X>
T<@Marker static X>
are silently accepted.
Parser.modifier is never read in this context.
Either the grammar should be changed not to allow normal modifiers in this position or we need to check and report any stored modifiers.
