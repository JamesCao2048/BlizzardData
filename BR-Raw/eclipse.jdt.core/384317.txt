Bug 384317 – [1.8][compiler] More smarts needed in Scanner.jumpOver()
BETA_JAVA8:
(1) As it stands now, Scanner.jumpOver can wastefully look ahead until EOF on
some ill formed programs (parenthesis imbalance early on).
We need to build
some ways to fail early.
A black list is one possible way already exploited
while looking ahead at '<'.
(2) In the same method, we are reusing the counter `found` for various
token classes.
It needs to be understood whether this is kosher to do.
