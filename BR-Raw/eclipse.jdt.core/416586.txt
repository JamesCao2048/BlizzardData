Bug 416586 – The doc for TagElement#fragments is confusing
While generifying API tools I came across some use of TagElement#fragments and while trying to update our code I realized IDocElement is not an API (or even visible) class - which is mentioned in the API docs as the list type:
* @return the live list of doc elements in this tag element
* (element type: {@link IDocElement})
*/
public List fragments() {
...
}
The doc does mention what kinds of nodes (implementations of IDocElement) can appear in the list, but it does not make sense to mention a private class in the API docs.
Consumers basically have to do the following:
List<ASTNode> fragments = tagelement.fragments();
when they are expecting to be able to do (according to the docs):
List<IDocElement> fragments = tagelement.fragments();
