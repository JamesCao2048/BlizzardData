Bug 292087 – anonymous class in array member initializer confuses content assist
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/4.3; Linux) KHTML/4.3.1 (like Gecko) SUSE
Build Identifier: I20080617-2000
One (commented) example is worth a thousand words:
public class Test extends Thread {
private class Nested extends LinkedList<String> {
// here content assist works correctly
private Runnable member[] = { new Runnable() {
public void run() {};
}
// here it thinks you're not in the array initializer anymore
};
// here it thinks you're not in Nested anymore
}
// here it thinks you're not in Test anymore
}
Reproducible: Always
