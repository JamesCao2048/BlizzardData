Bug 391895 – [1.8][dom ast] Annotation support for extended dimensions
BETA_JAVA8:
Internally, the compiler splits the declarations with multiple field/local
variables into multiple declarations.
On the DOM side, these are managed via
fragments with possible extra dimensions property.
The extra dimensions may
carry type annotations and we need to add support for that.
