Bug 28951 – Source attachment rootpath field missing in UI
In 2.1 M4 the source attachment no longer shows the field root path.
For this
reason, source attachment will not work.
I had projects created with older
version of Eclipse and those are functioning alright.
I was reading in bug: 27018, that the UI field for rootpath is no longer
necessary.
With my source jar files it is still necessary.
I edited the .classpath file manually to add the rootpath field, and after
restarting Eclipse, I can see corectly the attachment.
My source jar files have the rootpath src/java.
