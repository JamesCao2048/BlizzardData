Bug 430136 – [1.8][model] JavaElement.JEM_LAMBDA_METHOD should not use '*' and '>' as memento delimiter
JavaElement.JEM_LAMBDA_METHOD should not use '*' and '>' as memento delimiter.
I just saw that the fix for bug 425134 had to make adjustments in MementoTests.
That's not good.
Existing JavaElement handles should stay as stable as possible, see Javadoc of IJavaElement#getHandleIdentifier().
'*' and '>' were already used by existing mementos, and such stored mementos cannot be parsed any more now.
I see that most "safe" ASCII characters are already used as token delimiters or in token data, but these look free:
&')`
Forbidden character groups:
- identifier characters
- characters used in Signature (at least for parameter type signatures)
- , is IMO risky as well (often used by clients to separate data)
We should also have a test for lambda type and lambda method mementos.
I don't think these will be stored often (since they are inherently unstable), but they can be used locally (e.g.
to put an element on the clipboard, or for hyperlinks in Javadoc hovers).
