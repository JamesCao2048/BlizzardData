Bug 423685 – [1.8] poly conditional expression must not use lub
Consider an example like this:
class A{/**/}
class B extends A {/**/}
class G<T> {
G<B> gb=null;
G<? super A> gsa=null;
G<? super B> l = (true)? gsa : gb;
}
The conditional expression is a poly expression (appears in an assignment context) and hence should apply this rule from 15.25.3:
"The type of a poly reference conditional expression is the same as its target type."
ECJ, however still seems to use lub computation based on which the assignment is rejected.
Avoiding lub in situations like this is important because lub(capture1,capture2) doesn't produce good results, whereas the new rules are much more permissive.
