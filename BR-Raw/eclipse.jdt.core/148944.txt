Bug 148944 – need to render resource folders in JARs
3.2
Before fixing bug 142530, resources in JAR files were shown in package fragments also for folders that weren't legal package fragments.
We had discussion here about the fix, and found that rendering the resources as flat list is not a good solution.
We suggest to turn back the fix and accept the problematic package fragments, or better, add a new element for folders in JARs.
To be backward compatible I suggest to add a new interface that still implements IStorage:
interface IJARFileResourceEntry extends IStorage {
isFile(): boolean    // true if file, false if folder
getParent(): Object  // either a IJARFileResourceEntry or a IJavaElement
getChildren(): IJARFileResourceEntry[]  // empty if entry is a file
}
or if you don't mind adding two interfaces:
IJARFileResourceFile and IJARFileResourceFolder
I think this the best solution and also fixes our problem of not being able to reveal such elements (bug 142048)
