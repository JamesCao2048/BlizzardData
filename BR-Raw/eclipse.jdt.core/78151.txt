Bug 78151 – 'Insert single proposals automatically' should not insert without prefix
200410260800
- Have a new CU New.java:
public class New extends /*caret*/ { }
- Press Ctrl+Space with the cursor at the indicated location.
=> Was: 'New' is inserted.
=> Expected: Proposal popup with single completion is shown, even if 'Insert
single proposals automatically' is checked.
