Bug 420660 – [1.8][api] Make "effectively final" state of local variables available
Make the "effectively final" state of local variables available.
Should be easy to do in IVariableBinding.
Would also be very handy in ILocalVariable if possible.
We could sneak this into getModifiers()/getFlags() with an internal flag, but I guess it's better to add a boolean isEffectivelyFinal() API instead.
