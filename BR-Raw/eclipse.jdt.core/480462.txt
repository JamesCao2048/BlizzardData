Bug 480462 – [null] Cannot add external annotations to Guava libraries
Created attachment 257450 [details]
full error log
I'm trying to add external annotations, using the procedure at [1], to Guava libraries.
I've done it successfully for JVM classes before, like Map.get() as I described in Bug 467305.
Now I'm trying to do the same thing with com.google.common.collect.Table#get for example, but it does not work, I select the "Annotate" option but no pop-up shows up.
The following error is added to the Error Log however:
Error during computation of Annotate proposals: The type javax.annotation.Nullable cannot be resolved.
It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
I've attached the full stack trace of that error.
Guava uses its own set of Nullable/Nonnull annotation that they ship under the "javax.annotation" package, maybe this is what is confusing JDT?
