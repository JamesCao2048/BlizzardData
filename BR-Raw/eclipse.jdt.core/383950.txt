Bug 383950 – [1.8][compiler] Type annotations must have target type meta annotation TYPE_USE
BETA_JAVA8:
From the spec:
"If an annotation is not meta-annotated with @Target
(which would be poor style!), then the compiler treats the
annotation as if it is meta-annotated with all of the
ElementType enum constants that appear in Java 7"
This would mean that the following snippet should not
compile: but it does at the moment.
// ----------
@interface Marker {
}
public class X  extends @Marker Object {
}
