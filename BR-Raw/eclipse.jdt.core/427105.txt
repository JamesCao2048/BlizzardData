Bug 427105 – [1.8][builder] Differences between incremental and full builds in method contract verification in the presence of type annotations
Brought from bug 426515, comment #15
The following files should be in their own files:
I1.java
public interface I1 {
public String bar2( String s, @Marker List l1, List<String> l2);
}
-------------
A.java
public class A implements I1 {
@Override
public String bar2(String s, @Marker List l1, List<String> l2) {
return null;
}
}
Doing a clean build, you can notice there's no error.
But when you touch A.java in the editor, the reconciler reports an error.
