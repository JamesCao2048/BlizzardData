Bug 334315 – [compiler] Problem types with missing superclass or superinterfaces should use Object for missing types
When a type has a missing type binding for its superclass, it should dump java.lang.Object for the superclass, otherwise the class will never be able to load.
The user will get a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError.
The problem occurred for Andrew who was debugging some code where the ant task superclass was missing.
This prevents the problem method to be called and help the user to find out that the code didn't compile.
