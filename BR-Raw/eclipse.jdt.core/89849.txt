Bug 89849 – [1.5][assist] Completion in switch proposes already written enum constants
Using 3.1 M6 candidate: I20050330-0500.
Have following code:
public class E {
static final String BLANK = "    ";
void foo(Colors color) {
switch (color) {
case BLUE:
case RED:
break;
case <complete here>
}
}
}
enum Colors { BLACK, BLUE, WHITE, RED }
When I complete where indicated, I got all Colors constants although I would
expect only WHITE and BLACK to proposed.
