Bug 110797 – In case of multiple task tags on a single line, the tasks view does not show the complete line for each tag
Build is Build id: I20050923-1000 (aka 3.2 M2).
If for example I have the following line in my code:
// TODO FIXME need to review the loop
I will get the following items into the Tasks view:
TODO
FIXME need to review the loop
(plus file and line info).
I'd rather get something along the following:
TODO FIXME need to review the loop
FIXME need to review the loop
or:
TODO need to review the loop
FIXME need to review the loop
I could go for a single tag per line and that's it.
But I believe that multiple
tags can help when people rely heavily on the source code as the central
artifact of the project (say for example you have a series along the urgency,
and a series along the subdomains like DATA, BUSINESS_RULE, REGULATORY, etc.).
