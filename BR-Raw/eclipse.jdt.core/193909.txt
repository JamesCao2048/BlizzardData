Bug 193909 – improve content assist after 'instanceof'
3.3
The following code is quite common:
Object x= selection.getFirstElement();
if (x instanceof IType) {
x.get|code assist
Code assist should suggest methods of Object ('getClass') and of IType ('getFullyQualifiedName').
If a method of IType is selected, a cast should be added to x (and IType imported if necessary)
if (x instanceof IType) {
((IType) x).getFullyQualifiedName
