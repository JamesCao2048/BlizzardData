Bug 399791 – [1.8][dom ast] AST APIs should support code carrying interfaces (static & default methods)
BETA_JAVA8:
Interfaces can have default methods and static methods beginning Java 8.
We should stop tagging the AST as being malformed (see org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ASTConverter.buildBodyDeclarations(TypeDeclaration, AbstractTypeDeclaration, boolean)) and add tests to verify that the construction
looks ok.
