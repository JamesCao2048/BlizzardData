Bug 494831 – Formatter ignores whitespace rules for diamond operator
As of 4.5.2, formatter no longer respects "before opening angle bracket" whitespace setting for generic type parameter references.
For example, in 4.5.1, the formatter would produce:
List <String> list = new ArrayList <>();
with this setting enabled, as expected.
As of 4.5.2, this happens:
List <String> list = new ArrayList<>();
while this still works as expected:
List <String> list = new ArrayList <String>();
I have verified that this bug was introduced in 4.5.1 -> 4.5.2 by checking vanilla Eclipse installations of 4.5.1 and 4.5.2.
Should be easy to repro: just download latest Mars version (4.5.2), set the formatter to add whitespace before opening type parameter bracket, and try running it on code using the diamond operator.
