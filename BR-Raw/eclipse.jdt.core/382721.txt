Bug 382721 – [1.8][compiler] Effectively final variables needs special treatment
BETA_JAVA8
(1) The following program which does not compile under 1.7-
should now begin to compile with Java 8:
// -------- 8< -----------
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
X x = new X() {
void foo() {
System.out.println(args);
}
};
}
}
The proposed amends to 8.1.3 allow for a local class including anonymous
classes to use effectively final variables from its surrounding context.
(2) Likewise, we need to also allow lambda expressions to reference effectively
final, definitely assigned local variables, formal parameters or
exception handler parameter from the surrounding context (in addition
to finals)
