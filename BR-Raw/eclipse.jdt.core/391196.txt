Bug 391196 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler rejects type annotations in valid locations
BETA_JAVA8:
The following program should compile, but does not.
(note that javac also
erroneously reports one error, while we report 2 more):
// ----
@Marker public class X {
@Marker public int foo(){
Object o = (@Marker String) null;
}
}
@java.lang.annotation.Target (java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface Marker {
}
Per EDR section 2.3:
"A type annotation (one meta-annotated with @Target(ElementType.TYPE USE))
is permitted to be written anywhere @Target(ElementType.TYPE) or
@Target(ElementType.TYPE PARAMETER) would permitâ€”that is, on a class,
interface, or enum declaration, or on a type parameter declaration."
Also
"A type annotation may appear before a constructor, in which case it
represents the object that the constructor is creating (which is not
the same as the receiver of the constructor)."
Fix should go in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.Annotation.resolveType(BlockScope)
