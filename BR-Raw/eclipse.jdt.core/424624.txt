Bug 424624 – [1.8][null] if a static-object with annotation @NonNull is used, a warning is shown
A static class an a static fina object of this class are declared with @NonNull.
In another class the static object are used in as methode-argument that are annotated @NonNull.
The compiler shows the warning "Null type safety (type annotations): The expression of type '@NonNull Test3.Test3aa' needs unchecked conversion to conform to '@NonNull Object'" by the use of Methode "test1" in class "Test4" (see Attachment)
The warning says "Test3.Test3aa" but the Objectname are "Test3.Test3a".
