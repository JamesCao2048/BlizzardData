Bug 152135 – [breakpoints] Hovering on conditional breakpoint should show condition
For breakpoints that have a a condition enabled, it would be great, if I could see the condition without having to open the "breakpoint properties" dialog.
One way to do this is using the mouse hover tool tip popup thingy.
This is really useful when you have set a breakpoint more than a few hours ago, and are not sure of the condition.
Thanks

PS: Great Job with Eclipse 3.2...
With 3.x, Eclipse got to a point where I have started pushing people towards Eclipse.
