Bug 25890 – code assist displays static members on non-static expressions
I think the javac compiler complains when I try to access static fields of a
class using a concrete object.
However, eclipse proposes static fields as
suggestions in code assist.
This is very annoying.
For example, take the org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.Expression class.
It inherits many static fields.
But when I have
Expression exp = ....
exp.<CTRL+SPACE>
I don't want to see them all.
