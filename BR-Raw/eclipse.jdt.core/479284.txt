Bug 479284 – [1.8][inference] fail to resolve matching types for lambda and method reference + NPE at build
Created attachment 257130 [details]
code sample
type inference doesn't work for
Collectors.toMap(Function.identity(), t -> Arrays.asList(t), Util::sum)
where sum has signature
static <T> List<T> sum(List<T> l1, List<T> l2);
It works only after adding an explicit cast:
(BinaryOperator<List<X>>) Util::sum
or after type parameterization:
t -> Arrays.<X> asList(t)
Additionally malicious type parameterization of method reference like Util<X>::sum leads to NPE from build process.
affected version:
Version: Mars.1 Release (4.5.1)
Build id: 20150924-1200
This code compiles and runs on openjdk and works well in intellij idea.
In fact I report this problem only because my dev team uses both IDEs and ones with idea occasionally commit things like this.
