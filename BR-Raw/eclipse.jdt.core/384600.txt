Bug 384600 – [1.8] 'this' should not be allowed in lambda/Reference expressions in contexts that don't allow it
BETA_JAVA8
'this' keyword should not be allowed inside a lambda expression when the enclosing context does not allow 'this' to be used.
Example:
public class Action<T> {
public void f1(Object o) {}
public void foo() {
f1( (t) -> { if (t == 1) return t; else return this;} ) ;
}
}
This is in accordance with JLS 15.8.3
