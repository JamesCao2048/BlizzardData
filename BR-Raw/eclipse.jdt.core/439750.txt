Bug 439750 – New compiler option for Unused exception parameter warning/error
Since upgrading to Eclipse 4.5 integration build ID I20140715-0800, the following code snippet now triggers a compiler warning/error:
try {
...
} catch (Exception e)Â {
// do nothing
}
The error is: The value of the exception parameter e is not used
Turning off the setting "Value of parameter is not used" in the compiler settings removes this error.
We have that setting enabled, for example to warn of unused parameters in private methods.
Is it a design decision to have this setting also apply to exception parameters, or is just a bug?
