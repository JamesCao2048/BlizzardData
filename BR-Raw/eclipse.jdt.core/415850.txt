Bug 415850 – [1.8] Ensure RunJDTCoreTests can cope with null annotations enabled
As a big test to catch potential regressions caused by null analysis using type annotations, I ran all JDT/Core tests at 1.8 with null annotations enabled.
Currently this produces 124 errors and 37 failures.
I'm going to work through these regressions and provide patches via this bug.
