Bug 401246 – [1.8][compiler] abstract class method should now trump conflicting default methods
JSR 335 0.6.1 has a new exception in 8.4.8.4
"It is a compile-time error if a class C inherits a default method whose signature is override-equivalent with another method inherited by C, unless there exists an abstract method declared in a superclass of C and inherited by C that is override-equivalent with the two methods."
The "unless" part is new and must be implemented.
