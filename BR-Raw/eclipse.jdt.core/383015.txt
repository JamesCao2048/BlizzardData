Bug 383015 – [1.8][compiler] Improve error reporting for illegal modifier in TypeElidedFormalParameter
Consider the following snippet:
interface F2 {
void doit(String s1, String s2);
}
public void test1() {
ActionListener al = (public e) -> System.out.println(e);
F2 f2 = (abstract final s, @Nullable t) -> System.out.println(s+".."+t);
}
We correctly get three errors from the parser, but I'd suggest to improve
the messages:
- currently the position always includes the argument, shouldn't it only
highlight the modifier(s)?
- I think the message (currently "Modifiers are not allowed here") should
read more like other syntax errors.
- users won't typically consider annotations as modifiers so we should
probably use two different messages here.
