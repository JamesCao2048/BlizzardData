Bug 391521 – [1.8][compiler] Error highlighting is not accurate for type references with type annotations
In the following code:
class Y {
class Z {
}
Z z1 = (@Marker ZZ) null;  // 1
Z z2 = new @Marker ZZ();  // 2
}
@java.lang.annotation.Target (java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface Marker{}
The error highlighting includes the annotations as well, which shouldn't be the case.
It appears that the we are reporting the problem against the TypeReference and the source locations for the type reference includes the annotations as well.
It doesn't happen in other cases, let's say arguments, because the annotations are part of the argument and not TypeReference and hence the location for the TypeReference is accurate.
Also note that in the first line, the same error "ZZ cannot be resolved" is reported twice!
