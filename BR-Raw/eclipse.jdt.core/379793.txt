Bug 379793 – formatter hangs
Build Identifier: Version: 3.8.0 Build id: I20120516-2100
Every time I try to format the source for the attached file eclipse hangs.
I will attach a zip containing the file and the exported formatter-xml.
My Java-Version:
java version "1.7.0_06-ea"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_06-ea-b09)
Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 23.0-b21, mixed mode)
This is not the only source - but with this I can reproduce it always.
Reproducible: Always
