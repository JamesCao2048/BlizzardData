Bug 93249 – Code assist doesn't propose full method stub
- take revision 1.8 of BuildPathAction.
- in run method add the following
IRunnableWithProgress runnable= new IRunnableWithProgress() {
};
- inside the runnable type run<code assist> and select run
observe: only the following method signature gets inserted.
No method body.
Additionally IProgressMonitor is fully qualified.
public void run(org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor monitor) throws
InvocationTargetException, InterruptedException
