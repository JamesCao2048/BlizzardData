Bug 418919 – [1.8][compiler][internal] Remove boolean forcing creation of annotated bindings.
BETA_JAVA8:
In LookupEnvironment::LookupEnvironment, we have this code:
boolean stillTesting = true;
if (this.globalOptions.sourceLevel >= ClassFileConstants.JDK1_8 && (stillTesting || this.globalOptions.storeAnnotations)) {
this.typeSystem = new AnnotatableTypeSystem(this);
} else {
this.typeSystem = new UnannotatedTypeSystem(this);
}
At some suitable point, we should remove the boolean and let the other gating
conditions decide whether bindings should carry annotations or not.
Raising this defect so we don't drop this ball.
