Bug 409245 – [1.8][compiler] Type annotations dropped when call is routed through a synthetic bridge method
BETA_JAVA8:

It writes them to the classfile, including accounting for synthetic methods
(such as bridge methods) and optimizations" ...
At the moment type annotations are dropped if the call is routed through a
synthetic method.
