Bug 385374 – [1.8][compiler] JSR308 style annotations on JSR335 rules
BETA_JAVA8:
This ER is a bit forward looking: The 308 specification is silent on
whether type annotations can be applied on reference expressions.
(On
lambda expressions, they can be on explicitly typed formal parameters,
but this should automatically follow since the same productions are
used for (non type-elided) lambda formal parameter list as for any
method.) However early discussions in the EG are indicative of a spec
change to allow type annotations.
We should proceed to change our grammar to allow these already so we
can wrap up the grammar work and move on.
Should these be declared
illegal eventually, we could simply reject them during semantic analysis
which often results in better error messages anyways
