Bug 193784 – Proprietary licenses
Hi.
Eclipse contains some proprietary files which are troublesome for distribution.
First of all, in the source code:
./plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/src/com/sun/mirror/apt/AnnotationProcessors.java:
/**
* @(#)AnnotationProcessors.java  1.2 04/06/21
*
* Copyright 2004 Sun Microsystems, Inc.
All rights reserved.
* SUN PROPRIETARY/CONFIDENTIAL.
Use is subject to license terms.
*/
And secondly the file:
plugins/javax.servlet_2.4.0.v200705291052.jar
contains
./javax/servlet/resources/web-app_2_3.dtd
./javax/servlet/resources/web-app_2_4.xsd
./javax/servlet/jsp/resources/web-jsptaglibrary_2_0.xsd
that are all under a proprietary sun license.
