Bug 382713 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler should reject lambda expressions when target type is not a functional interface
BETA_JAVA8
The following program should be rejected on two counts:
// ---------- 8< ------------
interface I {
void foo();
void goo();
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
X x = () -> 10;
I i = () -> 10;
}
}
Former lambda expression's target type is not an interface at all,
while the latter's target type is not a functional interface.
At the moment, the compiler does not complain on either instance.
