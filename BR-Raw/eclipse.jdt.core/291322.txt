Bug 291322 – Test errors when running JDT Core tests on Windows 7
Some tests randomly cause exceptions on tear down when running on Windows 7.
This is caused by a known Windows issue that a lock on a file might not get freed immediately and hence subsequent calls to e.g.
delete the file fails.
Pattern is to retry several times.
