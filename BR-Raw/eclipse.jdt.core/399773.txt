Bug 399773 – [1.8][compiler] Cast expression should allow for additional bounds to form intersection types
BETA_JAVA8:
Java 8 amends to 15.16 allow type casts to constitute an intersection
type of the form (Runnable & Serializable), so the following program
is legal:
// -----
interface I {
void foo();
}
interface J {
}
class X {
I i = (I & J) () -> {};
}
// ---
ECJ at the moment lacks support for such constructs starting at the
grammar level.
