Bug 65738 – [builder] Build automatically happens only on every other save
After about the 2nd or 3rd time doing a save after starting Eclipse, I notice
that automatic builds only happen every other time that I do a save.
So, if I make a change to a CU, and save, an automatic build occurs.
 If I
then make a change to the same or another CU (regardless of whether in the
same project), a build does not occur.
 Making a third change to a CU (again,
regardless of which one), causes a build to occur for both the second and
third CU.
I'm running RC1.
