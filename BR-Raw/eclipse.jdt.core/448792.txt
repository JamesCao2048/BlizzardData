Bug 448792 – [1.8][compiler] More robust & fast captures needed for wildcards.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437444 introduces
interned captures:
This still needs follow up in three areas:
- To make it more robust we should capture using both the capturing
expression's source start and source end (along with CUD) not just the
source end as some times source ends are seen to be identical for the
containing and the contained expression (cast, assignment ...)
- TypeSystem.getCapturedWildcard may introduce performance problems as we
just maintain a linear list of captures across all files input to compiler.
These should be hashed somehow on a CUD basis.
- We need to see whether we need ATS.getCapturedWildcard and what it
would look like.
