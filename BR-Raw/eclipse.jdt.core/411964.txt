Bug 411964 – [1.8][null] leverage null type annotation in foreach statement
In JSE7 we have no way to figure out the nullness of a foreach element variable.
Using type annotations this becomes (easily) possible, it just needs special treatment in the compiler since we don't have the AST that assigns the element variable.
See also this TODO in ForeachStatement.analyseCode():
" once we have JSR 308 fetch nullStatus from the collection element type
and feed the result into the above check (instead of FlowInfo.UNKNOWN)"
