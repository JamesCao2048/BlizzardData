Bug 403036 – Wrong message is shown when there is no content for Javadoc
1.Create a class:
public class C1 {
String s;
}
2.
Hover on 'String' and click on the link for 'java' package.
The message shown in "Note: The attached Javadoc could not be retrieved as the specified Javadoc location is either wrong or currently not accessible."
The javadoc location is specified correctly and is accessible but for 'java' there is no javadoc available and hence no content can be retrieved.
The message indicates a problem with the url even though it is correct.
Cases for a wrong/Inaccessible url and a url where no content is available is not handled differently.
