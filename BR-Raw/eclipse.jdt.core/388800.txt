Bug 388800 – [1.8] adjust tests to 1.8 JRE
BETA_JAVA8
When using a current beta of a lambda-enabled JRE (lambda-8-b50), some tests fail due to changes in class libraries.
During the first bunch of testing I found that List.remove() is now a default method, which triggers a warning re missing @Override in some tests in MethodVerifierTest.
