Bug 366131 – [1.5][compiler] New generics compile error in Indigo SR1 for code that compiles in earlier Eclipse and javac
Build Identifier: 20110916-0149
The attached example source files demonstrate a new generics compile error found in Eclipse Indigo SR1.
This has also been confirmed in Eclipse Juno M3.
However, the examples compile in Helios SR2 and Indigo R, and also with javac from jdk1.6.0_29.x64 and jdk1.7.0_01.x64.
The error is:
"The method containsNC(Number&Comparable<? super Number&Comparable<? super N>>) in the type Range<Number&Comparable<? super Number&Comparable<? super N>>> is not applicable for the arguments (Comparable)"
Here is the GeoTools Jira issue:
GEOT-3971: NumberRange compile failure in Eclipse Indigo
https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOT-3971
The original affected source file is here:
http://svn.osgeo.org/geotools/trunk/modules/library/metadata/src/main/java/org/geotools/util/NumberRange.java
If this isn't an argument against static typing, I don't know what is.
 :-)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Open source files in Java editor in Eclipse SR1 or later.
