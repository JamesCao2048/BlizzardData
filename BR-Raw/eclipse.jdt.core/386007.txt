Bug 386007 – [1.8][compiler] Need Junit suite for Java8 tests alone.
BETA_JAVA8:
We need a smoke testsuite  for Java 8 work that will run only the Java8
tests.
This is so we can quickly test our changes to make sure none of
the new functionality is broken as we are churning the code.
The new suite could be RunAllJava8Tests:
It should run:
LambdaExpressionSyntaxTest
ReferenceExpressionSyntaxTest
TypeAnnotationSyntaxTest
DefaultMethodsTest
NegativeLambdaExpressionsTest
NegativeTypeAnnotationTest
ComplianceDiagnoseTest
