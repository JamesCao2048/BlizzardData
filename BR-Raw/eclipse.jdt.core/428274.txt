Bug 428274 – [1.8] [compiler] Cannot cast from Number to double
The JDK8 compiler accepts this cast but Eclipse JDK8 does not:
package junk;
public class Junk4 {
private void setValue(Number n) {
int rounded = (int) Math.round((double) n);
}
}
I expect other casts such as (float) and (int) should be accepted.
