Bug 455042 – Enable the Java model caches to recover from IO errors
The invalid archive cache is now evicted too infrequently.
Since jars can come from network drives and be subject to transient I/O errors, it should be cleared on every build.
As it stands now, the previously invalid jar will only get reevaluated if its timestamp changes or if the classpath is modified.
