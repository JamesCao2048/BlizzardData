Bug 430241 – [1.8][compiler] Raw return type results in incorrect covariant return bridge request to LambdaMetaFactory
The following program does not require bridges, but we request one:
// --
interface K extends I, J {
}
interface I {
Comparable<Integer> foo();
}
interface J {
Comparable foo();
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
K k = () -> null;
k.foo();
}
}
Problem in comparing return types as is to see if they differ - we should
compare the erasures - fix will follow shortly.
