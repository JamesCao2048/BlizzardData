Bug 405125 – [1.8][code assist] static members of an interface appearing after the declaration of a static member lambda expression are not being suggested.
public interface Foo {
int run(int s1, int s2);
}
interface X {
static Foo f = (int s5, int s6) -> x<ctrl-space>
static int x1 = 2;
}
x1 should have been suggested in assist; but not happening that way.
Thanks
