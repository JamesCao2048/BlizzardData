Bug 475865 – JDT deletes code
I have the following line of code:
private Runnable disposeRunnable = () -> dispose();
I change it to:
private Runnable disposeRunnable = this::dispose(); // not syntactical correct
and save.
I know that I still need to remove the () at the end but CTRL+S is hardcode into my fingers.
JDT changes the code to:
dispose();
To test this, you can use org.eclipse.jface.resource.ImageRegistry and adjust line 57 to the starting point of:
private Runnable disposeRunnable = () -> dispose();
