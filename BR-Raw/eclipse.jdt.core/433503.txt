Bug 433503 – Use OrderedTestSuite instead of listing all test methods again
Some jdt.core tests use an error-prone method to guarantee test execution order.
E.g.
JavaSearchBugsTests and JavaSearchBugs8Tests list all test methods again in the suite() method implementation.
1.
This hack should not be applied without an understanding why the tests fail when they are executed in random order.
2.
Instead of listing all test methods again, you should at least use a utility like
return new OrderedTestSuite(JavaSearchBugs8Tests.class);
or just
return buildModelTestSuite(JavaSearchBugs8Tests.class, ALPHABETICAL_SORT)
without the "if (TESTS_PREFIX != null || ..." before.
