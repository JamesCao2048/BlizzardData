Bug 79809 – [1.5][dom][javadoc] Need better support for type parameter Javadoc tags
20041130
To document a type parameter, the normal @param tag is used, but with angle
brackets.
/**
* @param <X>
*/
<X> void foo() {
}
The AST currently just returns a TagElement with a sigle children Name 'X' and
is currently not distinguishable from a normal parameter.
Either text elements '<' and '>' are inserted or we use a SimpleType node
instead of the SimpleName.
The first suggestion would make the accessing of tag names more complicated.
The drawback of the second suggestion is that it does not include the source
ranges for the open and closing angle brackets, but users can use the scanner as
soon as they see the SimpleType instead of the SimpleName.
The deluxe solution would be a new node type that includes the bracket and has a
simple name.
