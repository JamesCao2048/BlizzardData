Bug 376550 – "Method can be static" warning on method that accesses instance field in inner class
Build Identifier: 20120216-1857
The "Method can be static" code style warning does not properly account for anonymous inner classes declared within methods.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
From the menu select Window, Preferences.
2.
Go to Java, Compiler, Errors/Warnings.
3.
In the Code Style section set "Method can be static" to "Warning".
4.
Compile the following code.
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;
public class CanBeStatic {
private Object o = new Object();
public final Collection<Object> go() {
return new ArrayList<Object>() {
{
add(o);
}
};
}
}
Notice that you get the "can be declared as static" on the go() method.
But the warning is incorrect: if you declare the method as static then it won't compile because it references an instance field.
