Bug 382347 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler accepts incorrect default method inheritance
BETA_JAVA8
The following program should be rejected since a class is not allowed
to inherit a default method whose signature is override equivalent with
another method inherited by it.
It is not rejected at the moment.
// ----
interface I {
void foo() default {}
}
interface J {
void foo();
}
abstract class X implements I, J {
}
Please also test the interface case where similar prohibitions hold.
