Bug 442245 – [1.8][compiler?] These source files lead eclipse to hang (even just on copy/paste)
Created attachment 246188 [details]
Source files which cause the problem
These two files lead eclipse to hang when building the workspace.
Even if automatic build is turned off and a portion of text is copied to the clipboard within the java editor, eclipse hangs.
Project setup:
- please create a new Java project, source level: java 8
- copy the attached files to src/test
Thanks for your help,
Daniel
