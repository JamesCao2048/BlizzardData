Bug 364450 – Dubious class path error triggers a full rebuild
The following test case should show two fatal errors regarding unresolved w.I.
If we do some change e.g.
change the type of w.W#i from w.I to I, and then undo this change, we will get two build path errors:
1.
"The project was not built since its build path is incomplete.
Cannot find the class file for w.I.
Fix the build path then try building this project"
2.
"The type w.I cannot be resolved.
It is indirectly referenced from required .class files"
We can observe the same problem, if we change the order of imports in a.A instead of changing the type of w.W#i.
After the clean correct errors are shows again.
----------%<-----------
package a;
import w.I;
import w.W;
public class A {
}
package w;
public class W {
private w.I i;
}
