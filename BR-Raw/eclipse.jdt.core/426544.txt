Bug 426544 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler over-eagerly detects collision of single static imports
// --
package p;
public class X {
static public int f;
}
// --
package q;
public class X {
static public int f = 6;
}
// ---
import static p.X.f;
import static q.X.f;
public class X {
public static void main(String argv[]) {
}
}
elicits: "The import q.X.f collides with another import statement"
JLS7 7.5.3 says nothing about collision of single static imports.
JDK8 has started accepting this code and for compatibility's sakes we should
too.

The dates don't quite tally up, but these have some discussion FWIW.
