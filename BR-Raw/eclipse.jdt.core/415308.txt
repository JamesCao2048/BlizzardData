Bug 415308 – [1.8][compiler] Illegal type annotations not rejected
BETA_JAVA8:
----------
JSR308 2.1.2 states: Static member accesses are preceded by a type name, but
that type name may not be annotated:
@Illegal Outer.StaticNestedClass // illegal!
@Illegal Outer.staticField // illegal!
While we reject the latter snippet, we silently accept the former.
