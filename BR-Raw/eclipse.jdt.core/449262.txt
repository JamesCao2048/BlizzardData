Bug 449262 – [formatter] Allow the use of third-party Java code formatters
JDT should allow overriding of the built-in formatter via extension point so that users can supply their own Java formatters.
The built-in Eclipse formatter works great, but sometimes there are codebase-specific formatting options that the Eclipse formatter cannot do.
At Google specifically, we have an internal Java formatter that is specifically tailored to Google style that we would like to integrate into Eclipse.
This is the approach that is used in CDT, where one can plug-in one of the popular C/C++ formatters such as clang-format easily with an extension point.
I propose that JDT adds an extension point that allows a client to extend org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.CodeFormatter so that Eclipse will use their custom formatter.
The selection between the various formatters can happen in the "Formatting" preference page, where the combo box for selecting formatters is hidden if no custom formatters are provided.
This mirrors CDT behavior.
