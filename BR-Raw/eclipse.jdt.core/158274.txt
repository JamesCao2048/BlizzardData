Bug 158274 – Compile error in HEAD of AptConfigurationBlock
I20060922-0010
AptConfigurationBlock uses JDT/UI's internal class ListDialogField, which has been changed to fix bug 157085.
Consequently, you now have a compile error with APT and JDT from HEAD.
I thought I'd better file this, since it will only become apparent tomorrow when nightly builds are restarted after the milestone builds are over.
Please fix in HEAD and relase the plugin before the I-build on Tuesday (but not now, since that would interfere with the milestone :-).
