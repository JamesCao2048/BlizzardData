Bug 339913 – [compiler] Misleading error message for annotations inside a method body
public class X {
public static String foo() {
@interface C {}
return "";
}
}
Compiling this with HEAD leads to:
The member annotation C can only be defined inside a static context.
It has nothing to do with the static context.
Only the error message is wrong.
This is detected as an invalid local type.
