Bug 407189 – [1.8] ASTRewritingTest should also support _since and _only on whole test class
ASTRewritingTest should also support _since and _only on whole test class.
Currently, all tests in ASTRewritingTypeAnnotationsTest start with
if (this.apiLevel < AST.JLS8) return;
, making it look like they also run on earlier AST levels.
