Bug 125641 – Problems enabling AST with recovery
20060129
To get the AST with recovery enabled, I had to change the following lines:
Compiler.java, line 274: change to 			this.options.performStatementsRecovery = statementsRecovery;
CompilerOptions.java, line 730, comment out the test for OPTION_StatementsRecovery
What could be a bug is
ReconcileWorkingCopyOperation:makeConsistent
The AST created created on this.ast = workingCopy.makeConsistent
always has statement reconvery, even if not wanted.
