Bug 482775 – [javadoc] Autocomplete does not propose proceeding enum constants
I am using Mars/4.5.1.
Autocomplete does not propose constants that are defined after the cursor.
This happens in the absence of any compiler error.
Example:
public enum MyEnum {
/**
* @see #B|
*/
ALPHA,
/**
* @see #A|
*/
BETA1,
BETA2
}
If you press Ctrl+Space at | in BETA's javadoc, you will be recommended ALPHA.
If you do this in ALPHA's javadoc, you will not be recommended anything.
