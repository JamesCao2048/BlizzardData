Bug 95167 – [content assist] Spurious "Access restriction" error during code assist
build I20050512-1200
- OSGi, Runtime, SWT, JFace, UI, Text loaded from head
- open type on AbstractTextEditor
- at start of createPartContro method, type:
PartSite<Ctrl+Space>
- it has no effect in the editor, but the status line flashes in red: Access
restriction: The type SerializableCompatibility is not accessible due to
restriction on required project org.eclipse.swt
The type name doesn't seem to matter.
 "abcd" has the same effect.
I notice that org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor's classpath has an access rule
forbidding **/internal/** refs.
