Bug 401551 – [DOM/AST] Remove old grammar rules from Javadocs and deprecate all pre-JLS8 APIs
Some DOM/AST Javadocs like MethodDeclaration have become quite hard to read, because they start with outdated grammar rules.
The corresponding API methods are already deprecated, and the old grammar doesn't matter any more.
Any opposition to removing the outdated grammar and just leaving the current version?
