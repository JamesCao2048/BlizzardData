Bug 382960 – Java problem markers deleted in whole package after change in package-info.java
I20120608-1200
Removing @SuppressWarnings("all") from package-info.java does not trigger a rebuild.
When I add the annotation and save, then the warnings in the package disappear, but when I remove it, then the warnings don't reappear until I rebuild manually.
