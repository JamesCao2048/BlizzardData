Bug 255142 – [select] Codeselect should not omit cast
3.5M3
Hovering on #bar(...) invocation on line (5) should not show "<Object> Object bar(Object)" instead of "<String> String bar(String)".
The compiler does the right thing, but codeselect seems to ignore the presence of the "(String)" cast in front of selected expression; which leads to generic inference considering expected type (String).
import java.util.List;
public class X {
void foo(boolean b, Runnable r) {
Zork z = null;
String s = (String) bar(z); // 5
}
<T> T bar(T t) { return t; }
}
