Bug 424591 – [1.8][inference] capture-of-array causes resolution error
Created attachment 238533 [details]
Screenshot of spurious errors
With 4.3.1 + JAVA8_Beta (1.0.0.v20131221-0104_BETA_JAVA8), there are a number of spurious local variable resolution errors in the Graal project source code.
Unfortunately I cannot reproduce a small test case.
However, checking out the code and reproducing the problem is fairly straightforward:
hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/graal/graal/rev/72e2ec923b7b
cd graal
unzip eclipse-config.zip # attached to this bug report
Start Eclipse (running on top of JDK8) with new workspace directory being graal.
Configure a JavaSE-1.8 Execution Environment.
File | Import...
| General | Existing Projects into Workspace
Choose graal/graal subdirectory and import all discovered projects.
Once "Building workspace" completes, you should see about 33 errors in the Problems View, most of which are obviously spurious variable resolution errors.
See attached screenshot.
