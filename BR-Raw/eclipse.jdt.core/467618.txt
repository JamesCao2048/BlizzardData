Bug 467618 – [formater] Empty lines should not affect indentation of wrapped elements
The old formatter's implementation didn't indent wrapped elements if they were preceded with an empty line (except for elements wrapped with "force split" wrapping policy).
Attempts have been made to duplicate this behavior, but it leads to some problems - more details in bug 458208 comment 34.
With this and the fact that it's probably not a desired feature anyway, let's change the formatter to always properly indent wrapped elements.
