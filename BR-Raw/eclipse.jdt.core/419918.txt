Bug 419918 – [1.8][compiler] Annotations are not restored from class files in a few situations
BETA_JAVA8:
BinaryTypeBinding:655 reads:
// Note(stephan): currently the compiler is not interested in retrieving receiver annotations, here is how we would do it:
// IBinaryAnnotation[] receiverAnnotations = walker.toReceiver().getAnnotationsAtCursor();
Apart from this action, we also need to create an annotated type instance
for the declaring class and store it in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.MethodBinding.receiver.
javax.lang.model.element.ExecutableElement.getReceiverType() and
javax.lang.model.type.ExecutableType.getReceiverType() should answer the
annotated type.
