Bug 406587 – [1.8][compiler] Missing expected error for incorrect placement of type annotation
Can't see an existing bug for this (apologies if there is one!).
This came up whilst working on JSR308 code generation.
For this code:
====
import java.lang.annotation.*;
@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
@interface B {
int value() default -1;
}
class X {
@B(1) java.lang.String field;
}
====
javac flags that 'nested type cannot be annotated'.
 ECJ just lets it compile.
 IIRC as of the current spec version it should be written 'java.lang.@B(1) String field' for a type_use annotation that is intended to apply to the String reference.
