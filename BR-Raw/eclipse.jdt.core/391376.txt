Bug 391376 – [1.8] check interaction of default methods with bridge methods and generics
The failure reported in bug 382347 comment 6 showed that the method verifier made some assumptions regarding interface methods which no longer hold when default methods enter the picture.
The immediate problem could be fixed via bug 390761 by cleanly filtering the bogus error messages, thus leaving the delicate parts of the logic unchanged, viz.
code that handled corner cases involving generics and/or bridge methods.
We should still check whether this logic produces the desired behavior if default methods meet those situations with generics/bridge methods.
During analysis I found these bugs to be relevant:

- bug 194034
