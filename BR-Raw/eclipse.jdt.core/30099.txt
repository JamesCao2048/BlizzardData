Bug 30099 – NamingConvention.suggestArgumentNames: No guess returned
20030122
NamingConvention.suggestArgumentNames(...
"Class" ) returns no guess.
It would be good if NamingConvention could guaranteed that always at least one
guess is returned.
(c, class1), whatever.
Otherwise such 'extra' guessing code
has to be introduced on the client side.
