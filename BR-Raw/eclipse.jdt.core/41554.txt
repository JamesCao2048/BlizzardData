Bug 41554 – Assertion failure during search
Build: I20030813
I am getting an assertion failure during search.
 I am searching for references
to a private field.
 Searching in hierarchy or in workspace causes the same
assertion failure.
 Log file attached.
Olivier: The assertion is in the constructor for jdt.internal.core.SourceType.
If the assertion failure message included the name of the type, it would make
debugging this case easier.
