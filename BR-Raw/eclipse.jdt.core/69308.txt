Bug 69308 – All ASTNodes that deal with modifiers should offer a method setModifiers(List modifiers)
3.0
Dealing with modifiers in the new 3.0 API is complicated especially if you
want to copy modifiers of an existing node into a new node.
To ease this all
ASTNodes that deal with modifiers should offer a method setModifiers(List
modifiers).
This methods copies the modifiers from the parameter list into the
modifier list managed by the node.
The current list should be emptied first.
