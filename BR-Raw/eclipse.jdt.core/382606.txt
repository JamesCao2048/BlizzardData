Bug 382606 – [javadoc] constructor used in javadoc not getting resolved for secondary types.
Ran into this issue while working on bug 381567
####
package pkg;
/**
* @see A
*/
public interface A {
}
/**
* @see #B()
*/
class B {
B() {}
public void foo(){
new B();
}
}

Turn on javadoc processing and also turn on warnings for malformed javadoc comments.
Also make 'only consider members as visible as' Default and turn on 'Validate tag arguments'.
The warning "The method B() is undefined for the type B" gets reported.
