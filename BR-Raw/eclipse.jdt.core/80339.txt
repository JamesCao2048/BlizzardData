Bug 80339 – Wrong error message "; expected" when writing an interface
During an introduction course to Eclipse we got a error.
We wrote an interface
public interface Test {
public void myMethod()   <<-- without a semicolon!
}
and the tooltip and quick fix said that a curly brace is missing.
But there must
be a semicolon.
Have to retest that on 3.1MS3.
Sorry, havent have the time for download yet.
