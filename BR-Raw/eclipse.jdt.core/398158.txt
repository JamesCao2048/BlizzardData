Bug 398158 – Receiver qualifier can only be a simple name and not a qualified name
From bug 391893, comment #15:
The ECJ grammar at the moment reads:
VariableDeclaratorIdOrThis ::= 'this'
VariableDeclaratorIdOrThis ::= UnannotatableName '.' 'this'
UnannotatableName -> SimpleName
UnannotatableName ::= UnannotatableName '.' SimpleName
This is the bug for the grammar fix that is needed.
The second
rule needs to change to be
VariableDeclaratorIdOrThis ::= SimpleName '.' 'this'
