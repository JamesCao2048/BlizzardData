Bug 465910 – [formatter] add a 'wrap before operator' option for conditional expressions
In the 'Line wrapping' tab, 'Expressions' menu, the 'Conditionals' settings do not allow to wrap the line after the '?' and ':' operators.
There is a 'wrap before operator' setting for Binary expressions that can be unset and another one for multi-catch statements, but it is not possible to unset this for conditional expressions: wrapping is always done before the operator, never after.
When people use a wrap after operator policy, they often intend to use it for all kind of operators.
The checkstyle tool Wrap Operator Policy does not distinguish between different uses.
This means that is you set it to eol (operators are at the end of the line, and wrapping occurs after them), then you set it also for conditionals expressions.
With the current [formatter] setting, you cannot do that for conditionals even if you did it for binary expressions and multi-catch statements.
This is the same as bug #325631, but for conditionals.
This is however a different bug than #459304.
