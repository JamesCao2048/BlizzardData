Bug 431810 – Annotations on constructors are always interpreted as type use annotations
Created attachment 241511 [details]
Test project
We have a test in Xtext that fails on the current 4.4 integration build because
annotations on constructors are interpreted as type use annotations and as such no longer returned by IMethodBinding.getAnnotations().
The annotation does not have a @Target.
As we neither compile nor execute against Java8 this is a regression.
I've attached a test project: The (plug-in) test fails as long as the @Target is not defined on MyAnnotation.
