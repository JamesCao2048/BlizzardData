Bug 416379 – [1.8][parser] Should allow type annotations on return type of generic methods
I was day dreaming along these lines (see bug 416304):
<N extends Annotation> @N B f(@N A a)
Much to my surprise ecj didn't call me nuts but simply answered:
<N extends Annotation> @N B f(@N A a)
^^
Syntax error, type annotations are illegal here
Oops, this seems to be derived from (JSR 308 draft):
MethodOrFieldDecl:
UnannType Identifier MethodOrFieldRest
where in fact these original rule should apply:
GenericMethodOrConstructorDecl:
TypeParameters GenericMethodOrConstructorRest
GenericMethodOrConstructorRest:
(Type | void) Identifier MethodDeclaratorRest
Identifier ConstructorDeclaratorRest
in the second rule, unchanged for JSR 308, the NT Type now expands to
[Annotations] UnannType
Ergo: the above syntax should be accepted, leaving the question *why* the above
snippet is illegal as an exercise for the reader :)
As an aside, this implies that the following is legal though totally crazy:
@NonNull <T> @Nullable String foo() { return null; }
Bonus question: Can @NonNull in this example still be interpreted as a type annotation?
