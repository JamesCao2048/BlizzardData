Bug 419165 – [1.8][compiler] TypeBinding.id assignment interferes with hashmap storage/retrieval
BETA_JAVA8:
From https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=417113#c63:
// --
Working on type inference I discovered:
- an InferenceVariable (subclass of TypeVariableBinding) appeared twice as a key in a HashMap, assumably caused by:
- TypeBinding.hashCode relies on stability of TypeBinding.id
- UnannotatedTypeSystem lazily assigns ids, which violates stability
In that particular case I can workaround by either of:
- eagerly registering with UTS
- overriding hashCode() and equals()
Raising this issue here, because:
- the problem could potentially affect other subclasses of TypeBinding?
- the lone hashCode() looks strange without a matching equals()
@Srikanth, do you have reasons at hand, why the existing code is safe, or should I file a new bug?
// --
No, the existing code is not safe as your HashMap experience shows.
The id
assignment is safe from the pov of UTS + ATS, but that is not good enough.
I'll work on resolving this asap.
Thanks for catching this.
