Bug 480086 – [formatter] unwanted spaces in generic diamond operator
Created attachment 257342 [details]
INFOLOG Java code formatter
List< String > l = new ArrayList< >();
Our code formatter adds spaces after the opening brace and before the closing brace.
For other types of braces you can set an option to not add spaces when the braces are empty.
This option is missing for the diamond.
Mars will add an unwanted space between the generic brackets (diamond) for ArrayList.
