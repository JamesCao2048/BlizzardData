Bug 401796 – [1.8][compiler] don't treat default methods as overriding an independent inherited abstract method
Consider this example:
public interface I1 {
default void m() { }
}
public abstract class C1 {
public abstract void m();
}
public class C2 extends C1 implements I1 { }
I read the spec 0.6.1 part H, 8.4.8 as saying:
- I1.m is inherited because C1.m does not override it from C1
- C1.m is inherited because I1.m does not override it from I1
In 8.4.8.4 none of the sentences starting with "It is a compile-time error" apply.
This puts the following sentence to action:
"Otherwise, the set of override-equivalent methods consists of at least one abstract method and zero or more default methods; then the class is necessarily an abstract class and is considered to inherit all the methods."
Thus we should issue an error because C2 is not abstract.
This error is not reported currently.
