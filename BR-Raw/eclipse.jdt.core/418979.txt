Bug 418979 – [1.8][dom ast] Bad source ranges for annotated QualifiedType as type of ParameterizedType
Created attachment 236249 [details]
Test case to reproduce the issue
Outer1.
@Marker1 Inner is represented as a SimpleType of QualifiedName where the anotations sit on SimpleType, while QN includes Outer1 and Inner but not the annotation.
Need to alter the representation.
