Bug 61189 – Error messages with "AssignmentOperator ArrayInitializer" could be improved
build 20040506
With the following test case
public class X {
public void foo() {
(X) foo();
}
}
the error messages are
Syntax error, insert ";" to complete BlockStatements
Syntax error, insert "AssignmentOperator ArrayInitializer" to complete
ArrayInitializerAssignement
The corresponding grammar rule is
InvalidArrayInitializerAssignement ::= PostfixExpression AssignmentOperator
ArrayInitializer
This rule exist to perform better diagnose for expression like
x = {0}
But it would not be suggested as possible correction.
