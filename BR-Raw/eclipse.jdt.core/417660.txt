Bug 417660 – [1.8][compiler] Incorrect parsing of Annotations with array dimensions in arguments
Created attachment 235645 [details]
Test code to reproduce the issue
ArrayTypeReference generated for argument is incorrect.
Expected: int [] @TakeType(int[].class) []
Actual: int @TakeType(int[][].class) []
(only 1 dimension shown in actual, while the 2nd dimension is shown as part of annotations).
