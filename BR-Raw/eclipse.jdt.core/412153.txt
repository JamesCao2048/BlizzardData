Bug 412153 – [1.8][compiler] Check validity of annotations which may be repeatable
The current check for duplicated annotations need a going over.
If an annotation T is repeated at its use, it should be allowed, if:
- If the annotation declaration T has a Repeatable meta-annotation mentioning TC as the container
- if TC is allowed as the target where T is repeated
If T and TC is both used in the same context, it is an error (even if neither T nor TC is repeated)
Further, if TC is deprecated, a deprecation warning should be issued, even if T is not deprecated.
We should have a configurable warning if the multiple T's aren't contiguous.
