Bug 400899 – [1.8][search] Search engine/indexer should evolve to support Java 8 constructs
BETA_JAVA8:
This ER will be used as the master/umbrella entry for search engine changes
to support Java 8.
Please don't attach patches/fixes here.
Any high level
discussions can be had here, but all activity should be on broken down blocker
unit level tasks each with its own bug number.
Some quick experiments show that the search engine as is is able to discover
types and variables properly for lambda expressions.
For type annotations and reference expressions, there are various things
that appear broken.
