Bug 380501 – [1.8][compiler] Add support for default methods (JSR 335)
Add support for Default methods aka Virtual extension methods
aka Defender methods.
Other than enabling the wider adoption of lambda expressions in
existing libraries, this feature bears no connection to lambda expressions
per se and so is best tracked as a separate project.
Bug 380194 concerns itself with grammar changes for all of JSR 335.
Thus the grammar changes to support the current topic will be published
in bug 380194 (shortly.)
