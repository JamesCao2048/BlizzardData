Bug 426214 – [1.8] Eclipse compiler does not allow certain unicode characters as part of identiifers
Eclipse compiler reports errors on the following program:
public class X {
int a\u058f = 0; // Rejected
String a41\u08fc; // Rejected
float a\u057f = 1; // Allowed
}
My guess is that these are new unicode characters introduced after unicode version 6.0.0, which is the latest we seem to support.
Note there's been three versions since then, namely 6.1.0, 6.2.0 and 6.3.0.
At the moment, I have no idea what it takes to start supporting new ones.
Will investigate.
