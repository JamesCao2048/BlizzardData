Bug 443932 – [1.8][code complete] method reference proposals not applied when caret inside method name
Follow-up to bug 402081 and bug 433178.
Have this code:
IntFunction<String> ts= Integer::toString;
Set caret after "Integer::to" and press Ctrl+Space.
Try to apply e.g.
"toBinaryString(int)".
=> The proposal is not inserted.
The problem is that the replaceRange is wrong.
This code in CompletionEngine.findLocalMethods(..) line 8750 looks wrong:
if (completionOnReferenceExpressionName)
proposal.setReplaceRange(this.endPosition - this.offset - methodLength, this.endPosition - this.offset);
else
When I remove that change from bug 402081, then the proposals work as expected.
