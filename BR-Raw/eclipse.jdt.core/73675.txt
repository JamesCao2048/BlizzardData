Bug 73675 – [dom] Need AST creation pipeline
To speed up AST creation and to be able to share bindings between ASTs we
would need a pipeline to create AST.
The pipeline would work as follows:
- all CUs initially put into the pipeline are converted into AST and they
are handed back one by one via some sort of call back interface
- when the pipeline is empty a special hook is call to have the change to
add more CUs to the pipeline
- the pipeline can only contain CUs form the same project
- a CU can't be parsed twice.
Philippe, we looked at our code and it would
be a great help if we would be able to parse CUs a second time.
Would this
be possible if we guarantee that the content of the CU didn't change ?
