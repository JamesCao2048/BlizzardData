Bug 425040 – [1.8][formatter] Add option: "Insert new line after type annotation"
The formatter should have an option "Insert new line after type annotation", which should be disabled by default.
E.g.
for the following source, the formatter should only insert a new line after "@Deprecated", but not after any occurrence of @Annot (even if all other "Insert new line after annotations on ..." options are enabled):
package xy;
import java.lang.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;
public class Try extends@Annot Object {
@Deprecated public @Annot int b;
public@Annot()int foo(@Annot  List<@Annot()Object> a) {
return 0;
}
}
@Documented
@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface Annot {
}
Bug 401848 / bug 403816 have already discussed the problem that type annotations cannot be distinguished from declaration annotations in all cases, e.g.:
@Deprecated @Annot boolean hardToDecide() {
return true;
}
I don't think the formatter should resolve types, so the next best solution is to rely on a heuristic:
In ambiguous cases, consider annotations as type annotations
iff they appear after the last keyword in a modifier list.
This heuristic fails for the hardToDecide() example, but that's acceptable (and still way better than the current state, where the formatter produces bad results in many more cases).
