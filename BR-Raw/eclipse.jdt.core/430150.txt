Bug 430150 – [1.8][null] stricter checking against type variables
When writing a generic class as
class Foo<T> {
}
we want to be able to instantiate this class as either
Foo<@NonNull String> nns;
or
Foo<@Nullable String> nus;
Inside Foo usage of the type variable T should be checked more strictly to reflect that not only the type but also its nullness is unknown.
To enable the desired genericity, dereferencing a T value must assume @Nullable and assignment to a T variable must ensure @NonNull.
