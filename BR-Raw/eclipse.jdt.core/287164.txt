Bug 287164 – Report build path error if source folder has other source folder as output folder
Assume that you have project configured like this:
+src1 -> output to src1
+ A.java
+src2 -> output to src1
+ B.java
+ c.txt
c.txt is not copied into the src1.
If you configure output to bin, you will receive inside A.class, B.class and c.txt.
In the first example, c.txt should be also copied (or it should be impossible to allow for mentioned output path configuration).
