Bug 42243 – Incorrect syntax diagnosis for assert in source 1.3 mode
Build 3.0M3
The following source compiled in 1.3 source mode is flagged with a syntax error
as expected (assert isn't a keyword in 1.3 mode), but the error diagnosis is
rather misleading.
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
assert true;
}
}
--> Syntax error on token "assert", assert expected	!?
