Bug 486719 – [formatter] Formatter removes space in //$IDENTITY-COMPARISON$ resulting in compiler errors
Open LookupEnvironment from JDT Core code base.
Do a format (Ctrl+Shit+F).
The resulting code produces two compiler errors.
The reason being, formatting adds a space after "//" in //$IDENTITY-COMPARISON$.
This doesn't happen with //$NON-NLS-1$, though.
