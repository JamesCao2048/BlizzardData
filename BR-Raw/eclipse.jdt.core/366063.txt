Bug 366063 – Compiler should not add synthetic @NonNull annotations
From bug 365387 comment 47, I learned that the compiler creates synthetic @NonNull annotations if an enclosing element is annotated with @NonNullByDefault.
This makes the Eclipse compiler incompatible with a standard Java compiler, since the generated class files are not equivalent any more.
We should not deviate unless absolutely necessary.
