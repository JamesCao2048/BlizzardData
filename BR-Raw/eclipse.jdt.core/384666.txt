Bug 384666 – [1.8][compiler] improve debuggability of the Parser wrt lambda expressions
While reviewing bug 380194 I have some small suggestions that might help
during future debugging of this code:
(1) Scanner.toString()
How about including this.nextToken in the output, e.g.,:
if (this.nextToken != TerminalTokens.TokenNameNotAToken) {
buffer.append("<-- Ends here [regettable="+toStringAction(this.nextToken)+"]\n===============================\n"); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$
} else {
buffer.append("<-- Ends here\n===============================\n"); //$NON-NLS-1$
}
(2) LambdaExpression.printExpression():
In "this.body.print(tab, output);" 'tab' should perhaps be passed only
conditionally, like if body is a Block?
(3) LambdaExpressionSyntaxTest:
I'd personally prefer more explicit method names.
Or, ensure that actually
all contained methods test lambda expressions (and move other tests like for
reference expressions to a separate file).
I was trying to debug parsing of lambda expressions and was surprised that
some tests didn't contain any, yet I found no pattern for selecting only
the relevant tests.
