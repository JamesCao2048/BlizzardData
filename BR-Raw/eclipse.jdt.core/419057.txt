Bug 419057 – ITypeBinding#getModifiers() misses implicit "static" for class member interface
master and BETA_JAVA8
ITypeBinding#getModifiers() misses the implicit "static" modifier for member interfaces of a class:
public class C {
interface IC {} // implicitly static, see JLS7 8.5.1
}
(If you wonder about the reference to JLS7 8.5.1, then you may have an old version of JLS7 that contains a section 8.5.2 and a bogus 8.5.1 that said IC would be implicitly public -- that part has been removed again).
