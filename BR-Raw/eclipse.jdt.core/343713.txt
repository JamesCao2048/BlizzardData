Bug 343713 – [compiler] bogus line number in constructor of inner class in 1.5 compliance
Compile the following class with -1.5 -g :
public class LineNumberBug {
class Inner {
public Inner() {
System.out.println("Inner()");
} // line 10
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
new LineNumberBug().new Inner();
}
}
Inspecting the generated line number table you'll see that the first few
instructions are mapped to line 10, which is at least confusing.
