Bug 427483 – [Java 8] Variables in lambdas sometimes can't be resolved
With the most recent Java 8 support, Eclipse reports the error as given in the snippet:
new TreeSet<>((String qn1, String qn2) -> {
boolean b = true;
System.out.println(b); // ok
if(b) { } // Eclipse says: b cannot be resolved or is not a field
return qn1.compareTo(qn2);
});
