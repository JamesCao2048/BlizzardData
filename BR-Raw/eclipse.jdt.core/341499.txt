Bug 341499 – [compiler][null] allocate extra bits in all methods of UnconditionalFlowInfo
The patch in bug 247564 contains a few fixes that are actually independent
of the issue of field references: currently some methods in
UnconditionalFlowInfo fail to allocate the extra bits used for handling more
than 64 locals, namely:
markAsDefinitelyNonNull
markAsDefinitelyNull
markAsDefinitelyUnknown
IMO these fixes should be released for 3.7.
