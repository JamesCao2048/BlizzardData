Bug 382702 – [1.8][compiler] Lambda expressions should be rejected in disallowed contexts.
BETA_JAVA8.
The following program uses lambda expressions, method references and
constructor references in syntactically allowed, but semantically
illegal locations.
All these uses should be rejected and at the
moment they are not.
From proposed amends to JLS 15.27:
"It is a compile-time error if a lambda expression occurs in a program in
someplace other than an assignment context (5.2), an invocation context
(5.3), or a casting context (5.5)."
// ------------------- 8< -------------------
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Lambda in illegal context: " + () -> "Illegal Lambda");
System.out.println("Method Reference in illegal context: " + System::exit);
System.out.println("Constructor Reference in illegal context: " + X::new);
}
}
