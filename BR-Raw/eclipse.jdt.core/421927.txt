Bug 421927 – [1.8][compiler] Bad diagnostic: Unnecessary cast from I to I for lambdas.
BETA_JAVA8:
// -
interface I {
int run(int s1, int s2);
}
class X {
static int f = ((I) (int x5, int x2) -> x1).run(10,  20);
static int x1 = 2;
}
The cast is very much necessary as otherwise, the lambda's target type will
be missing.
