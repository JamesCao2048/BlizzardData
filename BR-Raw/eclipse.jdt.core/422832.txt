Bug 422832 – Class file triggers StackOverflowError when creating type hierarchy
Created attachment 237840 [details]
Example project to reproduce the StackOverflow
When I add the Aspose PDF library to my build path and I declare a class that extends one of the classes contained in the Aspose PDF JAR, I get a Stackoverflow error.
The same problem occurrs when I create a type hierarchy.
I stripped the Aspose library down to one class and removed all methods and fields.
The problem is caused by the type signature.
I think class A is declared to implement itself, which is strange as one cannot implement classes, but interfaces only.
However, the code obfuscator used by Aspose has somehow managed to create such a class file.
I know the class file is seriously damaged, but nonetheless Eclipse should not crash when dealing with such class files.
I'll attach an example project to repoduce the behavior.
The stack overflow contains these two methods:
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.BinaryTypeBinding.superInterfaces(BinaryTypeBinding.java:1384)
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.ParameterizedTypeBinding.superInterfaces(ParameterizedTypeBinding.java:1008)
