Bug 412151 – [1.8][compiler] Check repeating annotation's collection type
If a Repeatable annotation is present on an annotation declaration (T), semantics must be checked:
Informally:
- The collections type's (TC) declaration must have a array of Ts as its value()
- The @Retention meta-annotation of TC must at least include the retention of T
- TC's @Targets, if specified, must be a subset or the same as T's @Targets
- If T is @Documented, then TC should also TC be Documented
- If T is @Inherited, then TC should also TC be @Inherited
