Bug 147877 – source end of array access isn't correct
build I20060614-0843 + JDT/core HEAD
public class X {
void foo() {
int i = a[0\u005D;
}
}
During compilation the source end of the array access isn't correct.
The source end is at the start of the unicode character instead of the end of the unicode character.
