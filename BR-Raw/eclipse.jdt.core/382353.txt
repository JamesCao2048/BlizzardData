Bug 382353 – [1.8][compiler] Implementation property modifiers should be accepted on default methods.
BETA_JAVA8
The following program should trigger only two errors, but triggers four
instead.
Basically strictfp and synchronized should not allowed only
at interface abstract method declarations and should be accepted at
default method declaration sites as these after all describe an
implementation and are so suitable sites to annotate implementation
concerns:
// -----
interface I {
strictfp void foo() default {}
synchronized void goo() default {}
strictfp void boo();
synchronized void zoo();
}
