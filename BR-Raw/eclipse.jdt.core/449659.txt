Bug 449659 – [1.8][compiler] Investigate status of disabled generics tests
There are a few dozens of tests in GTT that are disabled for 1.8.
This ticket is to investigate the status of those and enable them
by possibly remastering the tests and/or fixing the compiler.
We should also check whether GRT* have similarly disabled tests.
