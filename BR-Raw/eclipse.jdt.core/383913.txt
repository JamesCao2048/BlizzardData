Bug 383913 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler should reject explicit this parameter in disallowed contexts
BETA_JAVA8:
Top of branch contains syntactic support for explicit this parameter
to facilitate attaching receiver annotations.
The compiler must perform
several validations here.
- Only at 1.8 explicit this should be allowed (done)
- Only as a first parameter (done)
Here is the relevant part of the spec:
Only the first formal parameter may be named this, and such a
parameter is only permitted on an instance method, or on a
static method or constructor of an inner class.
The type of
the this parameter must be the same as the class that contains
the method and should include type arguments if that class has
any.
In a method in an inner type, the receiver type can be
written as (for example) either Inner or as Outer.Inner, and
in the latter case  annotations on both parts are possible,
as in @ReadOnly Outer .
@Mutable Inner.
[I believe the "on the static method of an inner class" part
is wrong - clarifications have been sought from the EG]
