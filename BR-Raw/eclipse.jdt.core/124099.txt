Bug 124099 – [compiler] incorrect merge of flowInfo into UnconditionalFlowInfo#addInitializationsFrom in case of very long flow info
Build id: I20051215-1506
When both the receiver and otherInits have extraDefiniteInits but the receiver ones are longer than otherInits ones, the receiver info is reset while it should remain unchanged.
The test case is quite a bit long and is attached in a patch (need a lot of fields to get in the considered area).
Crafted XLargeTest#test009, for which the compiler complains on l not being initialized, which is wrong.
Added a suggested fix to the patch.
