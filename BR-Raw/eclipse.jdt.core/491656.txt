Bug 491656 – [search] doesn't find reference to binary method with parameterized argument type in nested class
Broken since 4.5, worked in 4.4.2
In a 1.7 project configured with a 1.7 JDK, open method
java.util.LinkedHashMap.Entry#addBefore(Entry<K, V>) and try to search for references.
=> No matches found, although there is a reference in recordAccess a few lines down.
Search still works fine for java.util.LinkedHashMap.Entry#remove()
In 1.8, LinkedHashMap has been restructured, but there a similar examples:
- references to java.util.LinkedHashMap.LinkedEntrySet#spliterator() are found
- references to java.util.LinkedHashMap.LinkedEntrySet#forEach(Consumer<? super Entry<K, V>>) are not found
=> Looks like the problem only happens for binary methods that have a parameterized argument type and that are declared in a nested class.
