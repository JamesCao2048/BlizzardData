Bug 421926 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler tolerates illegal forward reference from lambda in initializer
BETA_JAVA8:
-----------
The following program compiles with ECJ, but fails to compile with
8b115.
It appears ECJ behavior is incorrect.
// --
interface I {
int run(int s1, int s2);
}
class X {
static int f = ((I) (int x5, int x2) -> x1).run(10,  20);
static int x1 = 2;
}
