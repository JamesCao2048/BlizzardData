Bug 27555 – [startup] PackageFragmentRoot - source attached too early (?)
20021127
PackageFragmentRoot calls attachSource on openWhenClosed
which happens in the following scenario:
1.
'collapse all' in package explorer
2.
restart eclipse
3.
expand one project (i tried a source project - probably true for any)
4.
you wait a long time and 40% of that time is spent on attaching source to a
binary file that you have not touched yet
will attach profile
