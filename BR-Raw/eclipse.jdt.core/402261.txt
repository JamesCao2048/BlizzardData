Bug 402261 – [1.8][compiler] Shape analysis confused by returns from inner classes/lambdas
BETA_JAVA8:
The following program should compile, but does not and fails with:
"The method foo(I) in the type X is not applicable ..." message
// ---
interface I {
J foo();
}
interface J {
void foo();
}
public class X {
void foo(I i) {};
public static void main(String[] args) {
new X().foo(() -> { class local { void foo() { return; }} return () -> { return;}; });
}
}
// ---
The return from the inner classes is confused to be a return from the
lambda.
However the return from the lambda that forms the return expression
of the first lambda is handled properly.
