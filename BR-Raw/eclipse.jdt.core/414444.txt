Bug 414444 – [1.8][null] Configure null annotation bundle for 1.8 (TYPE_USE)
Following the discussion in bug 394539 the bundle org.eclipse.jdt.annotation
will be bumped up to 2.0.0 to require a BREE of 1.8 and change our annotations
for target TYPE_USE.
At the same time we don't want to loose the ability to run our tests in 1.7 mode.
I'm currently trying how the tests could automatically switch between both versions
of this bundle.
