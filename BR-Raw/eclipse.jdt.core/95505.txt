Bug 95505 – Can not use code completion
Eclipse 3.1 M7
It was very convinient in Eclipse that when it already knows type and I write
"new " and press Ctrl+Space, it shows this type.
For example:
button.addActionListener(new {cursor})
But in M7 I have now look, what type should be used and write several first
letters? Why? Please return old behaviour, at least make this optional.
