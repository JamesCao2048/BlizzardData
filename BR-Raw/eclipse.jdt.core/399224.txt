Bug 399224 – [1.8][compiler][internal] Implement TypeBinding.getSingleAbstractMethod
BETA_JAVA8:
From https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382701#c17:
// Stuff ...
(2) Implementation of a skeleton method for TypeBinding#getSingleAbstractMethod
(returns null or a PMB) and ReferenceBinding#getSingleAbstractMethod.
The
latter could at this point return null for non-interfaces and for interfaces
could ignore inheritance, object method redefinitions etc.
If no single method
could be found, this method should ideally return a ProblemMethodBinding
with ProblemReasons set to NoSuchSingleAbstractMethod.
// Stuff ...
While that bug will put in place the skeleton, the present one is tighten
the implementation and take care of all the myriad details.
