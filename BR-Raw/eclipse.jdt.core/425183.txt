Bug 425183 – [1.8][inference] make CaptureBinding18 safe
Bug 424712 showed that possibly a CallinBinding18 might be accessed in unsafe ways, here: dereferencing .wildcard, which is null for CallinBinding18.
While bug 424712 is resolved by way of other improvements, we should think of ways to make the use of CallinBinding18 safe in all situations.
