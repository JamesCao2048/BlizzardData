Bug 357110 – Problem with inner classes referenced from jars or class folders: "The type ... cannot be resolved"
Build Identifier: I20110613-1736
The opened Java-Editor shows reproducable under some circumstances the (wrong) error message "The type ..
cannot be resolved.
It is indirectly referenced from required .class files."
However, the Package-Explorer does not show this error.
The error is only displayed in the Editor.
If the error happens the org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ASTParser is not able to parse this java file (which is called by a plugin of mine).
I found no workaround for this but to refactor some classes not to be inner classes any more, but this is not really a good workaround.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
The error is reproduceable as follows:
- Create a class A with a static inner Class I in the sourcefolder "src"
with outputfolder "bin".
- Create a class B beeing a subclass of I in the same project in another
sourcefolder "src2".
Let the outputfolder of "src2" be "bin2".
- Create a class C beeing a subclass of B in the first source folder "src".
- Now change the project settings by removing the sourcefolder "src2"
and instead add the "bin2" folder to the libraries.
By this the class B is now only available as a binary class file.
- Open the Editor for the class C and find the error message describe above.
The same problem arises reproducably, if the the class file of B is not in a classfolder but in a jar.
There is no problem, if I is not an inner class but a normal class.
