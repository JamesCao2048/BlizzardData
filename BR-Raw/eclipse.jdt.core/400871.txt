Bug 400871 – [1.8][compiler] Overhaul overload resolution to reconcile with JLS8 15.12.2
BETA_JAVA8:
A number of changes are being made to overload resolution mechanism
to accommodate poly expressions in method invocation context.
ECJ needs to evolve to address this scenario, which creates some interesting
problems: When a lambda expression occurs in method invocation context as
an argument, the type of the lambda expression cannot be determined until
the overloaded method is chosen and the overloaded method cannot be chosen
until the lambda expression's type is known.
JLS8 15.12.2 (part F of JSR335 specification) spells out the amended
overload resolution rules to address this and other scenarios.
