Bug 433989 – Nested static generic class reference is incorrectly marked as compile error
Created attachment 242632 [details]
Screenshot of incorrect validation in latest stable build of Luna.
class A<V> {
public static class Container {
public static class In<T> {
public static class Inner<U> {
}
}
public static <X> void doit() {
new In.Inner<X>(); // compilation error
}
}
}
Mentioned piece of code is being reported by JDT to contain error with the following message:
* The member type A.Container.In must be parameterized, since it is qualified with a parameterized type (Java Problem)
However the code is syntactically correct and can be compiled via javac.
Tested on Eclipse Kepler, Juno and Luna (see attached screenshot) builds.
