Bug 381345 – [1.8] Take care of the Java 8 major version
Current java8 beta versions generate classes with major version 51.
java 7 also used version 51.
The tests uses the same constant to make an explicit run of the java versions.
Assuming that some of the next beta versions could change the version to 52, I have changed the constant to 52 with the fix for bug 380106.
However, while writing the class files it writes the version as 51.
Whenever java8 moves the version number to 52, we should change this version too.
- Look at Todos in CodeSnippetClassFile.java and ClassFile.java
