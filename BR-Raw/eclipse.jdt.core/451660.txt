Bug 451660 – [compiler][null] Wrong "Null pointer access: The variable can only be null at this location" warning
This example gives a "Null pointer access: The variable s can only be null at this location" warning for "s.toString()":
public static void main(String[] args)
{
String s = null;
for(; true;) // ok with "while(true)"
{
switch(0)
{
default:
s = "Hello!";
case 1:
System.out.println(s.toString());
}
return;
}
}
But of course this prints a friendly "Hello!".
This is a minimal testcase as far as I can see.
If anything is removed, there's no warning anymore.
There are a couple similar open bugreports, but they seem to be about different issues.
