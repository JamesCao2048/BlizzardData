Bug 399778 – [1.8][compiler] Conditional operator expressions should propagate target types
BETA_JAVA8:
The following program should compile fine, but fails to: We get three
error messages about: "The target type of this expression must be a functional interface" and an NPE.
// ----
interface I {
void doit();
}
class X {
Object o = (I) () -> {};
I k = (()->{});
I i = 1 == 2 ? () -> {} : () -> {};
I j = () -> {};
}
// ----
While addressing this, we also need to ensure that the following is a well
formed construct in Java 8 while not in Java 7:
List<String> l = condition ? Arrays.asList() : Arrays.asList("a","b");
