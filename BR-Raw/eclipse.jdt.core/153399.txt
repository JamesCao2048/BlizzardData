Bug 153399 – [javadoc] JDT Core should warn if the @value tag is not used correctly
I20060810-0010.
JDT Core should warn if the @value tag is not used correctly, e.g.
if in 1.4 the tag is used anywhere else than a constant.
Otherwise developers see no Javadoc problem inside Eclipse but then get burned by the 'javadoc' tool with:
warning - Inline tag {@value} should only be used with a constant field.
See also bug 144866 which should be revisited.
Also note that the @value tag usage changed with 5.0:
