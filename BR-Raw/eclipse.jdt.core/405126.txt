Bug 405126 – [1.8][code assist] Lambda parameters incorrectly recovered as fields.
public interface Foo {
int run(int s1, int s2);
}
interface X {
static Foo f = (int x5, int x11) -> x
static int x1 = 2;
}
class C {
void method1(){
int p = X.<ctrl-space>
}
}
Wrongly suggesting x5, x11.
Only x1 should have been suggested.
