Bug 335780 – Compiler says a method can be potentially static but this method contains 'this'
Build Identifier: A method using 'this' can't be potentially static
The latest beta of indigo introduces a new static analysis that detects
is a method can be potentially static.
But if I use 'this' in that method, it should not be tagged as potentially static.
public class MethodStaticEclipseBug {
public void m() {
Foo.m(this);
}
static class Foo {
static void m(MethodStaticEclipseBug bug) {
// do something cool here
}
}
}
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Type the above code in eclipse.
the warning at line 3 is a false positive.
