Bug 395886 – [1.8][DOM/AST] Withdraw annotations property from Name nodes.
As part of the fix for bug 391890, ANNOTATIONS_PROPERTY was added to Name nodes.
These need to be removed since the specification has changed to disallow
constructs of the form:
@Marker java.util.List
The proper way to annotate these is to say:
java.util.
@Marker List
Thus the presence of annotations before a certain segment of a qualified type
signals that what follows is a type and cannot be a name.
Very similar to how
the presence of type parameters signals a type.

When we converty a QualifiedTypeReference or its subtypes, we should
convert everything before the first type annotation seen as a SimpleType of
QualifiedName/SimpleName and convert everything further as types.
Compare how type parameters are handled in conversion of PQTR.
