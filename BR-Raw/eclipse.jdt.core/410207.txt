Bug 410207 – Compiler incorrectly reports error message "X cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files"

Reduced Test Case
I know there other bugs related to this message (ie.
239639, 320965, 391528) but this issue deals with backward compatibility with JDK 1.4 'built' jars.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.
Import the two projects from the attached zip
J14 (1.4 level)
J16 (1.6 level)
2.
Export J14 as a jar
3.
Bring up the properties for J16 and add the jar to its Java build path.
4.
Open the Main class in J16 using the Java Editor
--> You will see the errror message
5.
If you run the Main class as a Java Application, it works as expected.
This shows backward compatibility of 1.4 level jars.
The error message is misleading because the type/class is actually present in the jar.
