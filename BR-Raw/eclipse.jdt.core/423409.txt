Bug 423409 – [search] Search shows references to fields as potential matches
Created attachment 238107 [details]
Test project
- Import the attached project in your workspace.
- Find references of the constant field 'fi' of class Test2 via Ctrl+Shift+G.
=> Search view shows the references as potential matches instead of accurate matches.
(As a result, in inline refactoring:
- Press Alt+Shift+I on 'fi' declaration to inline all of its references and choose to delete the constant declaration.
- Click OK : We get the message "Inaccurate matches have been found...".
- Continuing deletes the declaration but the references are not inlined and we get compilation errors.)
