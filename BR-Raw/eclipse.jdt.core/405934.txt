Bug 405934 – [1.8][dom ast] thrown Exceptions with Type Annotations should have malformed nodes for AST level less than 8
Created attachment 229840 [details]
Test case to reproduce
See  java.io.@NonNull EOFException node in the attached test case using ast viewer:
thrownExceptions are converted to Name in ast level prior to 8.
These nodes should have malformed flag set (somewhere) in case of presence of type annotations in the thrown exceptions.
