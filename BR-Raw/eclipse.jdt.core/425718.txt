Bug 425718 – [1.8] default method changes access privilege of protected overridden method from Object
The following code is allowed by ECJ:
interface I {
default Object clone() { return null; }
}
public class Main  {
public void foo() {
I x = new I(){};
System.out.println(x.clone());
}
}
While Javac rejects it as clone is a protected method and should not be allowed to be accessed.
