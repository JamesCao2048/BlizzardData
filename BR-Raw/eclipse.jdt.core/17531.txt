Bug 17531 – [GlobalActions] File/Save As fails when entering valid file name
build F1
-select a Java file A.java
-select File/Save As
-append a -CP to the file name, i.e., A-CP.java
-select ok
->you will get an error message "Save Problems: Could not save file Reason:
Invalid name specified"
Apparently a refactoring rename is happening after the save as.
The Save as to
a file should not rename the class as a side effect of the save as.
The Save as
should not make any assumptions about what I plan to do with the new file.
