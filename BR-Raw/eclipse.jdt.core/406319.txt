Bug 406319 – [1.8][compiler][codegen] Generate code for enclosing instance capture in lambda methods
BETA_JAVA8:
This is spawned by splitting Bug 405068.

capture as these two topics are unconnected and involve altogether different
implementation concerns.
When this is resolved, we should also reenable the tests disabled via:
