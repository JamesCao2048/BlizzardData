Bug 399780 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler should allow static methods and disallow synchronized methods in interfaces.
BETA_JAVA8:
Lambda spec part H:
...
An interface may also declare static methods, which work in much the same way as static methods in classes, except that they are not inherited.
Often, an interface is the most appropriate place to declare methods that produce or manipulate objects of the interface type.
An interface method that is neither default nor static is implicitly abstract.
...
So the following program should compile and does with 8b74:
// ----
interface I {
static void doit() {}
}
// ---
