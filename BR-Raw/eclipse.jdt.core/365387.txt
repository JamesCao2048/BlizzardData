Bug 365387 – [compiler][null] bug 186342: Issues to follow up post review and verification.
This bug will be used a as a placeholder to log issues I discover during review
and verification of the implementation for bug 186342 for M4 test week.
Source code references are w.r.t the patch referred to by
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=186342#c196
Right now there is one issue:
(1) What are the changes in Scanner.java for ? Even without those changes all
tests pass.
Changes to Scanner.java almost always need to be mirrored into
PublicScanner.java and in this case, only one file has changed.
As this change, even if only a minor one, constitutes a change deep in the
entrails, we should justify this with a regression test.
Otherwise, if this
change is not integral to this feature we should consider backing out this
particular change.
