Bug 418096 – [1.8][compiler] Misattribution of annotations with C style array declarations
BETA_JAVA8:
We just ran into this testing APT changes for JSR308.
Given:
// ---
import org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull;
import org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Nullable;
public class X {
int @Nullable [] f @NonNull [] = null;
}
// ----
on the compiler side, when incorrectly fold the extra dimensions into total
dimensions and end up with
int @Nullable [] @NonNull [] f;
It should be
int @NonNull [] @Nullable[] f;
Since in a C style array declaration, the extra dimension should bind
more readily with the field than any type components preceding it.
While the compiler side story is easy to fix, it will break DOM/AST encoding
unless care it taken: some original dimensions could start showing up as
extra dimensions and vice versa !
I think it is not hard to fix cleanly end to end.
I'll see what can be done.
