Bug 393781 – In case of non matching argument list the message is not informative if short class name matches
Created attachment 223308 [details]
Non informative message
I have imported some backport class instead of the normal JDK class by accident.
The GUI told me, that the method arguments are not compatible, but it was not informative, since it showed the short name of the class.
See in the pictures.
Enhancement could be to display the fully qualified names in the message if the short name is matching.
Another enhancement could be a quick correction suggestion, which would look up other classes on the classpath with the same name as the class of the argument or the class, which declares the method.
