Bug 223899 – Base type var should not be proposed before Object var in == case
I20080325-0100
If you complete after zz in the following cu, zzvar1 is proposed before zzvar2.
There is no chance that zzvar1 would be compared to a since it is of a base type.
package p;
public class Test {
void foo(Object a) {
int zzvar1 = 1;
Object zzvar2 = null;
int zzvar3 = 0;
if (a == zz//complete here
