Bug 104245 – AST.newCompilationUnit javadoc error
The Javadoc for AST.newCompilationUnit contains the following second paragraph:
"Note that the new compilation unit is not automatically made the root node of
this AST.
This must be done explicitly by calling setRoot." But there is no
method setRoot, at least no such public method.
In fact, the abstract syntax "tree" is actually a forest, because there can be
multiple nodes without parents.
And calling the getRoot method on a particular
node will actually return the root of the tree in the forest to which that node
belongs.
To make a node the only root of the AST, one must only make every other
node children or descendents of it.
Two suggested changes: (1) remove the second paragraph from newCompilationUnit
javadoc and (2) include some discussion of what the "root" of an AST is in the
Javadoc for the AST type.
