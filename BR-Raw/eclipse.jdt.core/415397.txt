Bug 415397 – [1.8][compiler] Type Annotations on wildcard type argument dropped.
BETA_JAVA8:
From the spec:
"An annotation on a wildcard type argument appears before the wildcard, as in
MyClass<@Immutable ? extends Comparable<MyClass>>"
However, when the following program is compiled, the annotations are
accepted, but don't seem to make it to the class file:
// ---
import java.lang.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;
import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.*;
@Target(TYPE_USE)
@interface Immutable {}
class X {
List<@Immutable ? extends Comparable<X>> x;
}
// ----
javac 8b100 emits:
RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations:
0: #9(): FIELD, location=[TYPE_ARGUMENT(0)]
