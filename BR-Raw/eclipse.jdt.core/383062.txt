Bug 383062 – [1.8][compiler] Mirror changes to internal scanner in PublicScanner
As a part of the fix for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380194
a number of changes are being made to the scanner at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.parser.Scanner.
We need to determine
whether these changes should be mirrored at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.util.PublicScanner.
