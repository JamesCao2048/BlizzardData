Bug 416886 – [1.8][dom] ITypeBinding for the qualifier in a QualifiedTypeReference is wrong
BETA_JAVA8:
This test asserts in the last line:
assertEquals("Wrong qualified name", "test404489.bug.X.Y",
binding.getQualifiedName())
The bindings qualified name is actually test404489.bug.X.
I have disabled this line.
Please reenable after fix.
