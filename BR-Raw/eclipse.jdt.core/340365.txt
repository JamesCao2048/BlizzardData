Bug 340365 – [1.7] Problems in new APIs (TryStatementWithResources, DisjunctiveType)
BETA_JAVA7
Problems in TryStatementWithResources:
- wrong @since 3.0 tags
- order of properties in PROPERTY_DESCRIPTORS should be declaration order.
In the static initializer, the line
addProperty(RESOURCES_PROPERTY, propertyList);
should be moved to before
addProperty(BODY_PROPERTY, propertyList);
- for consistency, also the fields would better be ordered the same way (move "ASTNode.NodeList resources" up), and treeSize() should also be ordered
- constructor Javadoc should say "...
the try statement has no resources, ..."
- in AST#newTryStatementWithResources(), "no resources" should also be moved to front
- clone0(*) and internalGetChildListProperty(*) are missing "resources"
- memSize() should contain 4 * 4 (one field added)
Problems in DisjunctiveType:
- wrong @since 3.0 tags
- type Javadoc
- is missing grammar
- typo: "inside as catch formal parameter type": as -> a
- compare DisjunctiveType.java with e.g.
ParameterizedType.java and remove all unnecessary inconsistencies (e.g.
ordering)
