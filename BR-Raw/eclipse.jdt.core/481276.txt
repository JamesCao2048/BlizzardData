Bug 481276 – [null] Error markers not removed after fixing some null annotations
Using Eclipse 4.6-I20151029-1100.
1.
Import the attached project
2.
Open Snippet.java
3.
Open NonNullUtils.java
4.
In NonNullUtils, remove the first @Nullable from the checkNotNull method declaration
5.
Save the file.
At this point, the Problems view still shows errors ("Null type mismatch")
6.
Go back to the Snippet.java editor, the error disappears from the editor but is still in the Problems view
7.
Modify Snippet.java just to make it dirty and save.
The errors disappear.
