Bug 354502 – Incorrect Compiler Warning: "Method can be declared as static"
Build Identifier: I20110613-1736
Compiler shows warning that a method can be declared as static, but when declaring as static one will see a compiler error.
See steps to reproduce for details...
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
See attached project or follow instructions below:
1.
Turn on compiler warning for Code style "Method can be static".
2.
Create a java project with 2 packages (packageA and packageB)
3.
In package A create an abstract class (e.g.
AbstractExample) with an inner protected abstract class (e.g.
SubClass).
4.
In packageB create another class extending the abstract class (AbstractExample) from packageA.
(here called Example)
5.
Create a method in the class of packageB (Example) that creates a new instance of the inner class (SubClass).
6.
Call this method in the constructor of "Example".
As Is: One can see a compiler warning "method can be declared as static".
To Be: No compiler warning, as making this method static will lead to a compile error.
