Bug 477891 – [1.8] regression caused by the fix for bug 438812: order dependencies in analysis of default method inheritance
As discussed in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32663581/why-does-order-of-implementing-interfaces-with-default-methods-matter-in-java
Turns out that our fix for bug 438812 introduced a bogus order dependence:
//---
interface A {
public default void display() {
System.out.println("Display from A");
}
}
interface B extends A {
public default void display() {
System.out.println("Display from B");
}
}
interface C extends A {
public void display();
}
public interface D extends B, C {
}
//---
Prior to bug 438812 we correctly reported:
The default method display() inherited from B conflicts with another method inherited from C
After the fix we remain silent.
The error *is* consistently reported, however, if we change D to
//---
public interface D extends C, B { }
//---
