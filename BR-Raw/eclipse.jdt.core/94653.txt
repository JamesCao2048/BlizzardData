Bug 94653 – [1.5][select] Selection on invalid raw member type should still surface raw type
Build 20050509
When selecting on "Outer<String>.Inner", the associated binding key should show
Inner as a raw type, even if the qualifier is invalid.
class Outer<T> {
class Inner<U> {
}
Outer<String>.Inner inner;
}
