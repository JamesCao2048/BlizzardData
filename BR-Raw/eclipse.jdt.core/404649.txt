Bug 404649 – [1.8][compiler] detect illegal reference to indirect or redundant super
As of 0.6.2 para 15.12.3 contains this:
" If the method invocation has, before the left parenthesis, the form ClassName TypeName .
super .
NonWildTypeArgumentsopt Identifier, then:
[...]
Otherwise, if the TypeName denotes an interface, let T be the type declaration immediately enclosing the method invocation.
A compile-time error occurs if there exists a method, distinct from the compile-time declaration, that overrides (9.4.1) the compile-time declaration from a direct superclass or direct superinterface of T."
This rule is yet unimplemented.
