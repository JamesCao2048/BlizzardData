Bug 471270 – Enrich IllegalArgumentsExceptions with information about actual arguments in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.util.Util
Dear JDT team,
I am currently investigating Bug 471266.
Unfortunately, I have a hard time doing so as the IllegalArgumentException thrown in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.util.Util does not give me any information about the actual arguments for which Util.scanTypeVariableSignature failed.
As far as I can see, just using "throw new IllegalArgumentException()" is a prevalent pattern in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.util.Util.
Would it be possible to add information about the actual arguments? Or did you explicitly decide not to do so, in order to keep exception creation light-weight?
(FWIW, I would be willing to provide a patch.)
