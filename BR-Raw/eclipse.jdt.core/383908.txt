Bug 383908 – [1.8][compiler] Explicit this parameter interferes with method overloading/resolution.
BETA_JAVA8:
Post support for explicit this parameter as a holder for receiver annotations,
we now accept this program which we should not:
// ------
public class X {
void foo(X this) {
}
void foo() {
}
}
The other side of the coin is that the following should compile,
but doesn't anymore:
// --------
public class X {
void foo(X this) {
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
new X().foo();
}
}
