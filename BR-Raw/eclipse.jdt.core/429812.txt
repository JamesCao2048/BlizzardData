Bug 429812 – [1.8][model] Signatures returned by lambda IMethod APIs should be dot-based
The signatures returned by lambda IMethod APIs should be dot-based.
Currently, getReturnType() and getParameterTypes() return slash-based signatures.
This needs to be fixed to make Javadoc hovers on Lambda expressions work (once codeSelect on "->" returns the lambda method and not the SAM).
Example:
interface I {
/**
* Does it! Really.
* @param number the int
* @param str the String
*/
Object doit(int number, String str);
}
class X {
I i = (i, s) -> {
return null;
};
}
E.g.
use the JavaElement view to inspect the local variable "s" and then check its declaring member.
- second parameter type is "Ljava/lang/String;".
Should be "Ljava.lang.String;".
- return type is "Qjava/lang/Object;", which is wrong.
An unresolved signature ("Q") cannot be qualified.
Should be "Ljava/lang/Object;"
- please also check the other API methods
