Bug 488461 – Javadoc for CompilationParticipant.isAnnotationProcessor() is not accurate
Javadoc for CompilationParticipant#isAnnotationProcessor() is not accurate.
It says:
Returns whether this participant is interested in only Annotations.
but that's not what it does.
It only tells whether annotations are processed by calling CompilationParticipant#processAnnotations(BuildContext[]).
Other APIs of the CompilationParticipant are not affected.
