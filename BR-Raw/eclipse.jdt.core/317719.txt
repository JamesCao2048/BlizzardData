Bug 317719 – Method incorrectly flagged as having same erasure output when return type differs
The following class fails to compile under Eclipse 3.6, but works fine with Eclipse 3.5 and javac.
The methods are distinguished by the different return type, as having the same return type makes javac report two compilation errors as well.
bc..
package com.example;
import java.util.List;
public class ErasureBug {
public String output(List<Integer> integers) {
return "";
}
public void output(List<Double> doubles) {
}
}
