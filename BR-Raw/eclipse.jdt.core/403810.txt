Bug 403810 – [1.8] @since tags need adjusting.
BETA_JAVA8:
At the moment, we have been tagging Java 8 API items (mostly IProblems)
with "@since 3.9"
This needs to be adjusted to be "@since 3.9 BETA_JAVA8"
We don't want to use 3.9.1 since we want to be able to distinguish between
what gets added in 3.9.1 in normal course and what got expressly added for
Java 8 support.
