Bug 422901 – [1.8][code assist] Code assistant sensitive to scope.referenceContext type identity.
BETA_JAVA8:
There are a bunch of checks in SelectionEngine + CompletionEngine that look
like the following:
if (scope.referenceContext instanceof AbstractMethodDeclaration) {
// ...
}
All these places need to upgrade to LambdaExpression as a potential reference
context.
Example that breaks:
interface I {
void foo();
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
I i = () -> {
syso|    // no proposals here.
};
}
}
