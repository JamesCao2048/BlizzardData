Bug 405843 – [1.8] SourceTypeConverter should expose type annotations.
This bug to be used to discuss and come up with changes that are required in Java model to support type annotations (JSR 308).
At this point there is nothing critical or broken, but the requirement will be driven largely by the client.
If needed, raise separate bugs to track individual requirements.
Some of the things that may need correction are method signatures, type parameter signatures etc.
