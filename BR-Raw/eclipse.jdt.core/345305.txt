Bug 345305 – [compiler][null] Compiler misidentifies a case of "variable can only be null"
Build Identifier: 3.6.1 M20100909-0800
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
String s = null;
while (true) {
try {
s = "hi";
}
finally {
s.length();
s = null;
}
}
}
}
The compiler warns on the s.length() line saying that s can only be null at this point, which is not true -- in fact it can NEVER be null.
This test case is totally contrived, but distilled from something more real :)
Reproducible: Always
