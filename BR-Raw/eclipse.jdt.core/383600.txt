Bug 383600 – [1.8][compiler] Receiver annotations for inner class constructors require grammar change to support qualified this
JSR 308 draft proposal requires support for type annotations
on inner class constructor's receiver using this syntax:
class Outer {
class Inner {
@Result Inner(@Receiver Outer Outer.this, boolean b) { }
}
}
here @Result is a type annotation that is attached to the result type of
the constructed object, while @Receiver is a type annotation attached to
the type of the receiver of the inner class constructor invocation
i.e the enclosing instance.
