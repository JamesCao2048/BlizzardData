Bug 326950 – [compiler][null]Do not optimize code generation based on static analysis (dead code)
We had introduced optimization for the generated code for if-else statements in 3.6, such that when the compiler can determine either the if or the else branch will never be executed, it optimizes out that code.
This optimization was basically dependent on the compiler's static analysis.
Because of this, we think there's a risk involved in making changes to static analysis code, since any change may directly affect the code gen, and if there's a regression introduced by the change, it will manifest itself in the code generated.
Because of the associated risk as mentioned above, I suggest we keep the improvements done to static analysis, but do not optimize if-else code generation based on static analysis.
