Bug 401989 – [1.8][compiler] hook lambda expressions into "can be static" analysis
I was alerted by code in LocalDeclaration.analyzeCode() which relies on methodScope.referenceMethod() to perform "can be static" analysis, the latter method returning null within lambda expressions.
While that particular piece of code might actually be OK, I noticed a problem with the following program:
interface I {
void make();
}
public class Nesting {
int val;
private I test() {
return () -> System.out.print(val);
}
public void call() { test().make(); }
}
When enabled, the following bogus warning is issued:
The method test() from the type Nesting can be declared as static
We should check what exactly is missing to let lambda expressions participate in this analysis.
