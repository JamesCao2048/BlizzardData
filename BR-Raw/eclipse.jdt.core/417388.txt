Bug 417388 – TypeBinding on a TypeReference for parameter does not have type use annotations
Here is a simple code:
class X {
public void foo(@Marker int p) {}
}
Now, for parameter 'p', Argument#type#resolvedType (which is a BaseTypeBinding)doesn't contain the type use annotations.
Interestingly, Argument#binding#type (which is also a BaseTypeBinding) contains the annotations correctly.
Ideally, they should be referencing the same object.
