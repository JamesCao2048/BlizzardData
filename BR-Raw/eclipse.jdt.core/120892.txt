Bug 120892 – [assist] inconsistent completions for constructors an methods
I20051214-0010
Consider the CU below and invoke code assist behind the opening parentheses of the method and the constructor call, respectively:
======== Try.java ========
package pr120542;
public class Try {
void m() {
wait(
new String(
}
}
==========================
- The completion proposals received for the 'wait' method all have an empty completion, while the proposals for the 'String' ctor all have a completion consisting of a single closing parenthesis: ")".
This seems inconsistent to me and causes bug 120542.
