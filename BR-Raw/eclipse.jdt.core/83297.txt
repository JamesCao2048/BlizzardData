Bug 83297 – [1.5] Annotation bindings don't provide their declared elements/methods
I20050118-1015
@Annot(value="Hello", count=-1)
@interface Annot {
String value();
int count();
}
The ITypeBinding for @Annot does not provide the declared elements/methods.
#getDeclaredMethods() returns an empty array, instead of method bindings for
value() and count().
