Bug 411273 – [1.8][compiler] Bogus error about unhandled exceptions for unchecked exceptions thrown by method reference.
import java.util.function.Function;
public class TestMethodRef {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Function<String, Integer> f = Integer::new;
}
}
This is accepted by javac(of course, 8) but throw an error in my onw built BETA_JAVA8.
From the semantics of lambda, it should be ok.
Note, BETA_JAVA8 is a method ref, but not a method invocation.
This is so common, but we forget to implement it? Or, may I have a wrong build for BETA_JAVA8?
Anywhere, team, good work in these months!
thanks,
Jin
