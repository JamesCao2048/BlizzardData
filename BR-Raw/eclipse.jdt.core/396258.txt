Bug 396258 – [1.8] adopt new syntax for annotations on qualified type names in NullTypeAnnotationTest
Bug 394356 had to simplify some tests in NullTypeAnnotationTest due to the
spec change from '@NonNull java.lang.Object' to 'java.lang.
@NonNull Object'.
I should re-introduce some variance of this kind because the new syntax
forces annotations to be interpreted as type annotations, where until now
the syntax was ambiguous with SE7 annotations.
