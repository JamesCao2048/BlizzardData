Bug 471062 – Formatter inserts space before line comment
Every time I edit a source file, all my line comments have an extra space inserted between the semicolon and the double slash.
This is causing havoc with my github repo.
Checked items in the formatter:
Enable line comment formatting
Format line comments on first column
Preserve white space between code and line comments
Never join lines
This only started to happen after I installed Mars.
