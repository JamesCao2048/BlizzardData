Bug 103148 – [1.5][assist] Code completion breaks if using static method generics ( Class.<T>staticMethod(params) )
Everytime I have to put a call to a generics-enabled static methods, code
completion stops to work after the method call.
Generics syntax which broke the completion
Class.<T>staticMethod(params);
Pseudo-example:
EnumSet.<MyType>of(MyType.VALUE1, MyType.VALUE2);
Real-example:
EnumSet.<Mode>of(Mode.BINDING, Mode.READABLE, Mode.WRITABLE);
Since this happens quite often for me (I'm very fond of generics enumset, they
are sooooo handy & easy to use instead of the old error-prone untyped bitsets),
it's quite a nuisance.
Anyone can confirm this?
P.s.
thanks for this life-saving & deadline-saving tool! :D
