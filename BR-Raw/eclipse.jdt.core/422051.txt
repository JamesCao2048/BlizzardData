Bug 422051 – [1.8][compiler][tests] cleanup excuses (JavacHasABug) in InterfaceMethodTests
InterfaceMethodTests uses two excuses from JavacHasABug, where the bug has been fixed meanwhile:
- Javac8AcceptsDefaultMethodInAnnotationType
- Javac8ProducesIllegalAccessError
Since the bug was in unreleased EA versions, I believe we should simply remove these excuses.
Additionally, testBug421543b() shows a warning (re missing @Override) only from ecj, not from javac.
This situation should simply be avoided.
