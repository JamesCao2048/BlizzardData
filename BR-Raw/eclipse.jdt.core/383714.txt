Bug 383714 – [1.8][compiler] Compile fails to reject 1.8 constructs at 1.7- modes.
BETA_JAVA8:
This is a spin off by splitting bug 381358 into two: One dealing with
correctness issues (the current bug) and the other dealing with quality of
diagnostics (bug 381358).
This is so that the correctness issues could be
worked on an a priority basis:
(1) The following program does not elicit an error message at the
moment, when compiled as a 1.7- project.
It should be rejected with
a message that reads "Default methods are available only at source
level 1.8 or above"
// -----
interface I {
public void foo() default { System.out.println("Place holder"); }
}
(2) The following program should be rejected at 1.7-, but is not at
the moment:
// ---
interface I {
void foo(int p);
}
public class X {
I i = System::exit;
}
(3)
// ---------------------------
interface I {
int foo(int p);
}
public class X {
I i = p -> 10;
}
