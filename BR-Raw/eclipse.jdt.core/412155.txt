Bug 412155 – [1.8][compiler]Calling a @deprecated method in a separate class from within a lambda causes a ClassCastException and terminates the AST generation
Created attachment 233006 [details]
Two classes that reproduce the bug
Please refer to the attached java files to reproduce this:
When calling a method with a @Deprecated annotation from within a lambda method, the JDT core crashes with the following Exception:
eclipse.buildId=4.4.0.I20130630-1602
java.version=1.7.0_25
java.vendor=Oracle Corporation
BootLoader constants: OS=linux, ARCH=x86_64, WS=gtk, NL=en_US
Command-line arguments:  -os linux -ws gtk -arch x86_64
Error

Error in JDT Core during AST creation
java.lang.ClassCastException
Please note that this only happens if the deprecated method belongs to a different class than the one that contains the lambda.
