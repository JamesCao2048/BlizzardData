Bug 382350 – [1.8][compiler] Unable to invoke inherited default method via I.super.m() syntax
BETA_JAVA8
Compiler needs to be enhanced to support the new
InterfaceName.super.method() construct.
The following
program which should compile alright fails to compile
as of now:
// -------
interface I {
void foo() default {}
}
class X implements I {
public void foo() {
I.super.foo();
}
}
We issue a message:
"No enclosing instance of the type I is accessible in scope"
