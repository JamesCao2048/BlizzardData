Bug 249692 – The ImportRewriteAnalyzer does not honor a formatter setting
I think the source clean up module "formats code" before it "organize imports" if selected.
In some configurations (like my one) the clean up show every time changes on the imports even if there were none.
i think because of the "whitespace before semicolon" option on format.
hint: select every option in source format and in source clean up.
then cleanup source to reproduce.
every time there will be shown some changes on imports.
