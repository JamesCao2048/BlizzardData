Bug 402831 – [1.8][compiler][internal] ReferenceExpression should not implement ReferenceContext.
BETA_JAVA8:
There is an abstraction/modeling problem in that ReferenceExpression
implements ReferenceContext (through its parent FunctionalExpression)
Only LambdaExpression needs to implement ReferenceContext to trap errors
and signal incompatibility during applicability check phase of overload
resolution.
ReferenceExpressions do not introduce a scope and their congruence with
the target type is limited to there being a single compile time declaration
with suitable return types and hence these need/should not implement ReferenceContext.
Patch will follow shortly.
