Bug 406619 – [1.8][compiler] Incorrect suggestion that method can be made static.
BETA_JAVA8:
I get a hint from the compiler that default method foo of I can be declared
static.
Default methods cannot be static.
// ---
interface I {
default int foo(int x, int y) {
System.out.println("I.foo(" + x + "," + y + ")");
return 10;
}
}
