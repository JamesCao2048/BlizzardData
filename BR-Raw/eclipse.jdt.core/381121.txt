Bug 381121 – [1.8][grammar] Arrays should be allowed in reference expressions
JSR 335 draft spec lists out the following productions for
method references:
MethodReference:
ExpressionName '::' NonWildTypeArgumentsopt Identifier
Primary '::' NonWildTypeArgumentsopt Identifier
ReferenceType '::' NonWildTypeArgumentsopt Identifier
It also lists out "int [] :: clone" as an example of method references.
This example cannot be reduced to any of the rules above: There are two
questions here, whether array types are allowed and whether primitive
array types are allowed if the former is.
We need to ask the spec master react suitably.
