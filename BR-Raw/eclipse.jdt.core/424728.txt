Bug 424728 – [1.8][null] Unexpected error: The nullness annotation 'XXXX' is not applicable at this location
Using the JAVA8 preview to compile a large code base.
Preview version is 1.0.0v20131229-0103_BETA_JAVA8.
The compiler reports errors like: "The nullness annotation 'Nullable' is not applicable at this location" for parameter definitions that have a type specified as a qualified path (not a SimpleName).
For instance, the error is reported on:
public QualificationLookupInput(@Nullable Qualification qualificationProperty, @Nullable java.util.Date checkDate) {
(second parameter).
Removing the java.util resolves the problem.
Other examples:
public void renderNodeContent(@Nonnull NodeBase component, @Nonnull NodeContainer node, final @Nullable OldHelpManager.Entry object, @Nullable Object parameters) throws Exception {
(third parameter, with Entry being an inner class)
@Nonnull
public java.security.cert.Certificate[] getCertificateChain() {
(return value)
