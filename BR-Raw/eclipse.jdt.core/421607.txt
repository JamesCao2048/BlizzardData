Bug 421607 – [1.8][compiler] Verify Error with intersection casts
This program when compiled with ECJ and run produces a verify error:
interface I {
public void foo();
}
class C implements I {
public void foo() {
System.out.println("You won't get here");
}
}
public class X {
public static void main(String[] args) {
((C & I) (I) new C()).foo();
}
}
I am not sure if this is a valid program, but the code is compiled without any errors.
When run, an exception with the following reason is thrown:
Reason:
Type 'I' (current frame, stack[0]) is not assignable to 'C'
Current Frame:
bci: @13
flags: { }
locals: { '[Ljava/lang/String;' }
stack: { 'I' }
