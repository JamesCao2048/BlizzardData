Bug 484220 – [dom][ast][compiler] Invalid AST structure
Reproducible on latest Eclipse Luna version
Steps to reproduce:
-create following class
import java.util.Collection;
public class InvalidTree {
public void foo(Collection collection) {
/** javadoc */
for (final Object obj : collection) {
}
}
}
-use AST View to inspect AST tree
-EnhancedForStatement has correct position 123+42
-PARAMETER represented by SingleVariableDeclaration node which is a child of EnhancedForStatement is corrupted and has following invalid position: 105+39
It looks like removing javadoc or final modifier fixes the problem with invalid SingleVariableDeclaration, but of course it is not acceptable workaround.
