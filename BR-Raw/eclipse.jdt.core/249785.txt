Bug 249785 – [javadoc][assist] Javadoc content assist after "@see #" does not work with deprecated member before
I20080930-0921
- have:
package xy;
public class Try {
/**
* @deprecated bad
*/
public int field;
/**
* @see #
*/
public void m() {
}
}
- content assist after "@see #"
=> does not work (no proposals)
- remove deprecation from the field
=> content assist proposes members of xy.Try, as expected
