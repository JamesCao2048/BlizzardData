Bug 399769 – [1.8][compiler] Use of '_' as identifier name should trigger a diagnostic.
'_' is a reserved keyword in Java 8 and cannot be used as an identifier
per 3.9 Keywords [Modified] of the proposed spec.
8b74 only issues a warning at this point, though the spec requires an
unambiguous error.
X.java:9: warning: '_' used as an identifier
I  _ = null;

(use of '_' as an identifier might not be supported in future releases)
