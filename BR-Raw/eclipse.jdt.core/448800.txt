Bug 448800 – [1.8][compiler] CaptureBinding.substituteInferenceVariable may need some changes
From https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437444#c48
CaptureBinding:
Own version of substituteInferenceVariable() no longer handles superclass & superInterfaces (nor lowerBound, which we didn't handle before, either).
Question: can we assert that the fresh CaptureBinding created here gets initializeBounds called when needed? Could we end up working with an insufficiently initialized CaptureBinding downstream?
=> @Srikanth, please comment.
This needs follow up.
