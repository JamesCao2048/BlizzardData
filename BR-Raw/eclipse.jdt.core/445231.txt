Bug 445231 – [compiler] IllegalAccessError running Eclipse-compiled class
Created attachment 247419 [details]
whole Eclipse project, with 4 source files and their compiled .classes as well
The code below, when compiled by Eclipse (4.4.1), causes an IllegalAccessError to be thrown by "clazz.isAnonymousClass()" when it's run.
The same code can be successfully compiled and runs properly by java's javac (java 1.7.0).
I encountered this problem on my project, and then did my best to trim it down to a minimal reproduceable case, but I still need 4 classes in 2 java packages.
Just about anything that I try to trim down any further makes the problem disappear.
Be careful tinkering with this: incremental compile sometimes does not toggle the thing to go good/bad (i.e.
when making any change to the code, do a full clean and re-run).
I attach here the entire project as a zip, including the .classes as I see them.
BTW, here's a few examples of things that make the problem go away:
1.
Stop calling .setJobName on Buggered
2.
Make Base public
3.
put all classes in the same package
4.
simplify the generic type of Base.Builder
