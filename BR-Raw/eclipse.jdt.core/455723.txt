Bug 455723 – Nonnull argument not correctly inferred in loop
The following class produces a compiler error:
public class Problem {
public void fubar(final @Nullable String arg) {
if (arg == null) {
return;
}
doSomething(arg);
// no errors here
while (true) {
doSomething(arg);
//          ^^^  compiler error
}
}
private void doSomething(@NonNull String arg) {	}
}
The error is "Null type mismatch (type annotations): required '@NonNull String' but this expression has type '@Nullable String'".
It seems that because the invocation of doSomething occurs within a loop (any kind of loop gives this result), the compiler no longer knows that the argument was already inferred as nonnull.
