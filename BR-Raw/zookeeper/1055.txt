Bug 1055 - check for duplicate ACLs in addACL() and create()
actual result:

[zk: (CONNECTED) 0] create /test2 'test2' digest:test:test:cdrwa,digest:test:test:cdrwa
Created /test2
[zk: (CONNECTED) 1] getAcl /test2
'digest,'test:test
: cdrwa
'digest,'test:test
: cdrwa
[zk: (CONNECTED) 2]

but getAcl should only have a single entry.
