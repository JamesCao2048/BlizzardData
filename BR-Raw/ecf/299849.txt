Bug 299849 – [remotesvcs] RegistrySharedObject#handle* can throw NPE
In this code:
if (remoteContainerID == null || getLocalContainerID().equals(remoteContainerID)) {
return;
}
XMPPRemoteServiceAdapterFactory#XMPPRegistrySharedObject#getLocalContainerID()
returns container ID as connected ID:
protected ID getLocalContainerID() {
// For XMPP, the local container ID is its connected ID.
return getContext().getConnectedID();
}
this code returns XMPPContainer.remoteServerID
But! If we will invoke method XMPPContainer.disconnect() then we will set remoteServerID to null and getLocalContainerID will return null.
In RegistrySharedObject#handleAddRegistration we will have NPE.
This situation can occur because we receive/handle packet in another (not main) thread.
We can receive message in thread A, close connection in thread Main and begin handle received message in thread A.
Therefore we can got NPE.
