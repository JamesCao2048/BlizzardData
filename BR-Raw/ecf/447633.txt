Bug 447633 – The SCP file browse capability will not return files beginning with '.'
The SCP file browser executes a bash command remotely to list the properties of all files in a directory.
 This command effectively is:
"for file in <directory>/*; do stat --format='%F|%s|%Y|%n' $file; done"
Unfortunately, this will not return files that begin with the '.' character, and it does not work with filenames containing spaces.
My initial thought is to modify the command to cover the '.' issue:
"for file in <directory>/*.*; do stat --format='%F|%s|%Y|%n' $file; done"
and adding documentation for the issue with spaces in files.
