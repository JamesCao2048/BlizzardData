Bug 490819 – Add constants to allow configuration of ecf discovery for remote services
Currently, it's impossible for remote services to configure the use of the ecf discovery API for remote service advertise/discover.
  For example, the ttl of the publish.
 To do this all that's required is adding a couple of new constants, and the handling of these constants in the ECF RSA implementation.
