Bug 303156 – API breaking change in org.eclipse.ecf.remoteservice.IRemoteServiceProxy.getRemoteServiceReference()
Here's an excerpt from the API guidelines [1].
Adding an API method
====================
Can adding an API method to a class or interface break compatibility with existing Clients?
If the method is added to an interface which Clients may implement, then it is definitely a breaking change.
---
Thus the bundle major version of "org.eclipse.ecf.remoteservice" must be incremented to 4.0 to indicate the breaking API change.
