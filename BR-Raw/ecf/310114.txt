Bug 310114 – [core] remove dependencies so that ECF can run on other OSGi frameworks
Currently, the ECF framwork runs on Equinox only.
 There has been community input that people would like to see the ECF bundles run on other frameworks.
To do this, we will have analyze existing dependencies, and eliminate those that cannot be incorporated into other frameworks.
 In some cases this may reduce support for internationalization (i.e.
NLS).
