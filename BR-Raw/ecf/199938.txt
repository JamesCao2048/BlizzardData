Bug 199938 – [core] Simplify startup extension point
ECF has an extension point: org.eclipse.ecf.startup that allows other plugins to run their own code when the core ECF plugin is started.
This extension point should be simplified via name refactoring and enhanced to add optional synchronous and asynchronous invocation.
