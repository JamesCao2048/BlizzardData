Bug 232530 – [MSN] Session and subclasses needs to handle whitespace and exceptions better
I am using ECF 2.0.0.v20080514
I am seeing very frequently parsing problems in the ChatSession.read() method which lead to exception which causes the death of the Session$IdleThread that processes the received messages.
If an unexpected Exception occurs I can no longer receive messages in the current session.
So perhaps it is better to protect the Session$IdleThread  from any uncaught exceptions.
One of the cases that leads to the described behavior is this:
The original received message which is being processed by the ChatSession.read():
"MSG s_boshev@prosyst.bg s_boshev@prosyst.bg 129
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
X-MMS-IM-Format: FN=MS%20Shell%20Dlg; EF=; CO=0; CS=cc; PF=0
e de"
This leads to this exception:
Exception in thread "Thread-12" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 5
