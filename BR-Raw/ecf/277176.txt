Bug 277176 – Service Discovery view not working with osgiservices
When I bring up the Service Discovery view in the client, I see my machine
under Neighborhood, and under my machine, I have osgiservices
[tcp]:iana.
 When I run the ECF examples, I see remotesvcs [tcp]:iana.
When I right-click on osgiservices [tcp]:iana, I'm not getting the
connect menu option.
