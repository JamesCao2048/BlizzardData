Bug 263613 – [transport] Update site contacting / downloading is not cancelable
3.5M5
If an unresponsive update site is enabled (e.g.
the main Eclipse site after releasing a Milestone), the "Install New Software" or "Update" actions don't complete.
Cancelling the jobs in the Progress view does mark them as cancelled, however, the jobs take a long time to actually finish.
Expected behavior: any networking job should immediately respond to a cancellation.
