Bug 476163 – Remove host config properties from EndpointDescription
When a remote service is exported, it may be provided config properties (via properties passed to the registerService call).
  These properties are used to configure the provider and generally should not be passed onto the creation of the EndpointDescription, as they are host-side configuration properties.
ECF's RemoteServiceAdmin implementation should be modified accordingly to remove config properties from the EndpointDescription properties.
