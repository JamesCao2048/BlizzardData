Bug 264698 – Defer location retrieval for BitTorrent provider
Build ID: I20090202-1535
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Verify, that Property 'General>Startup and Shutdown>Prompt for workspace at startup' is checked
2.
Close workbench
3.
Restart workbench with -clean option
-> Workspace Launcher is not displayed, eclipse starts with default workspace
-> Property is still checked
-> restart workbench with or without -clean option and Workspace Launcher will not show up
4.
Uncheck property, apply and restart workbench
5.
Check property, apply and restart workbench
-> eclipse now starts with workspace launcher (..
unless you didn't chose -clean option..)
More information:
This looks like this property has a persistence mechanism that gives room for improvement ;)
There's a risk, that -clean not only affects this property but desynchronizes other properties aswell.
