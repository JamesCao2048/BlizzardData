Bug 257861 – Split org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.IDiscoveryContainerAdapter into "Locator" and a "Advertiser"
org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.IDiscoveryContainerAdapter exposes two disjunct functionalities.
One is locating/finding a service, the other is advertising/annoucing them.
They should be separated into two independent Intefaces since we've learned that consumer ususually only want to use either of those.
E.g.
a server impl advertises services and a client is limited to locating services.
Also provider implementations for both functionalities might require different sets of resources/privileges/...
E.g.
SLP advertiser need to bind to port 427 whereas locators do not (see bug #238710).
