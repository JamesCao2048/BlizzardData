Bug 204329 – [remoteservice] registry not updated if adapter accessed after connect
If the remote services adapter is accessed *before* container connect, then all is well with the replication of a remote registry.
 If, however, the adapter is first accessed *after* the container connect, then remote replica contents are not automatically distributed and won't appear.
so, this works:
final IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter remoteContainerTwo = (IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter) clientTwo.getAdapter(IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.class);
clientTwo.connect(serverID, null);
Thread.sleep(1000);
final IRemoteServiceReference[] refs = remoteContainerTwo.getRemoteServiceReferences(null, IConcat.class.getName(), null);
while this does not:
clientTwo.connect(serverID, null);
final IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter remoteContainerTwo = (IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter) clientTwo.getAdapter(IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.class);
Thread.sleep(1000);
final IRemoteServiceReference[] refs = remoteContainerTwo.getRemoteServiceReferences(null, IConcat.class.getName(), null);
because of the ordering of the getAdapter and connect calls.
