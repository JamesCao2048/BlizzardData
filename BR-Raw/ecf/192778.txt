Bug 192778 – [UI] Easy way to browse contacts via key shortcut and search dialog
This has always been a dream of mine for use within IM clients, maybe because I develop so much.
I want something similar to Ctrl+Shift+T in Eclipse for browsing IM contacts quickly and messaging someone.
I believe Eclipse has this functionality now abstracted into a class AbstractSearchDialog (or w/e it is called).
Ctrl+Shift+C (contacts) maybe? Ctrl+Shift+M (messaging)?
Any thoughts?
