Bug 228876 – [Discovery][jSLP] org.eclipse.ecf.provider.jslp.container.JSLPServiceInfo.getServiceURL() needs to remove "IANA" itself
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
Method JSLPServiceInfo.getServiceURL() does not check for "IANA" and remove it in the service url before return the result.
This results in "IANA" is included explicitly in the service url, which is not allowed as stated in RFC2608.
