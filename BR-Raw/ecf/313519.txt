Bug 313519 – Suggest reference to the ECF system properties in the error message
Build Identifier: 20100218-1602
Maybe a duplicate of #299444, but since I did not debug eclipse to find out more, I am not sure.
When using the update manager to get new plugins,it seems any download of a plugin jar greater than 4-5Mo leads to the following error (or similar) :
!ENTRY org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine 4 4 2010-05-19 09:31:11.383

java.io.InterruptedIOException: Timeout while reading input stream

During the whole update process, I can see the small jars properly downloaded.
The "big" jars seem to be properly downloaded, but for an unknown reason, it fails at the very end of the download process.
My company runs a proxy.
It is set as "native" in eclipse.
I tried to download one of the problematic jars with firefox.
It works properly, but just before it finishes the download, it pauses for an unknown reason several seconds before finishing properly.
The file is then readable and contains everything it is intended to contain.
What I am supposing is the following: the proxy is blocking the last chunk of the file for an internal process (maybe an antivirus analysis), and p2 times out during that "tiny" interval.
I suggest adding a timeout preference to handle an abnormally long pause from the proxy (or anything else)
AFAIK, this problem affects last galileo release (fully updated) and helios M7 (last one I tried).
It did not happen before a week or so: something must have changed in the proxy configuration but I do not think the issue should be dealt on the proxy since firefox handles it flawlessly.
I file it as Major since I am unable to get any new meaningful plugin as of now.
Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
Seems to happens when one of the downloaded jars are big enough.
