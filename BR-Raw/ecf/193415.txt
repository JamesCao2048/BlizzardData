Bug 193415 – [UI] Contacts view menu entries should be disabled when we aren't logged in
If you aren't logged in, you can press the chevron in the contacts view to do various things 'Add Account', disconnect all accounts, etc...
these shouldn't be shown or at least be disabled if we aren't logged into anything.
