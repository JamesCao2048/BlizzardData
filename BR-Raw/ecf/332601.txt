Bug 332601 – Request for API addition to support remote service call authorization
Build Identifier: ECF 3.4
In order to support remote service call authorization additional API would be needed on remote services:
- Interface with method to be able to check authorization of remote service call, something like:
public interface IRemoteServiceCallPolicy {
public void checkRemoteCall(IRemoteServiceRegistration registration, IRemoteCall remoteCall, ID fromID) throws SecurityException;
}
- Method to set IRemoteServiceCallPolicy on IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter
- [ECF generic] Adapt RegistrySharedObject to perform checkRemoteCall just before the remote service method call
Reproducible: Always
