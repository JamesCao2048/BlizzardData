Bug 238976 – Shared Editor: No notification for connect / disconnect / connection break
There is no notification when a session through the shared editor is initiated, closed, or broken (remote side disconnected).
This is especially annoying for the client side, where future modifications can be made to the source code, without getting back to the originator.
