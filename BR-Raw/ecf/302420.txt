Bug 302420 – [Discovery][JmDNS] Make listening interface configurable
A new property should be added "net.mdns.interface" which make the listening interface configurable.
E.g.
-Dnet.mdns.interface=192.168.5.6 binds JmDNS to the interface with the IP address 192.168.5.6.
Btw.
"net.mdns.port" already allows to redefine the listening port.
