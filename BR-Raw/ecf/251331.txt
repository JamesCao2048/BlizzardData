Bug 251331 – [Discovery][jSLP] Add ServiceURL.getHost() returning URI user-info part
Fix which introduces ch.ethz.iks.slp.ServiceURL.getUserInfo() which return
the user info part.
ch.ethz.iks.slp.ServiceURL.getHost() has been altered
to just return the host.
Since this is an API change, the Bundle-Version
has to be increased to 1.1.
