Bug 224095 – FileTransferInfo shares its properties with other instances
If you create a FileTransferInfo without specifying any properties, it ends up pointing its preferences at a static Map implementation instance.
So in theory, various instances of FileTransferInfo could be sharing the same Map.
This doesn't sound like the expected behaviour to me.
