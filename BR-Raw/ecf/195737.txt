Bug 195737 – [appint] Provide ability to export/import task context via ECF communications
The context sharing should happen synchronously using ECF.
Drap&drop a task on the person in the roster view or choose from a context menu "Share With" and select a person you want to share the task.
On the other side, the notification window should popup asking whether the person wants to accept the context or not.
If selected yes, then the person goes to Import Wizard and apply the received context to the selected task.
If selected no, the sender should get a message, that the sharing was rejected.
