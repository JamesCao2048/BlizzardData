Bug 331383 – Remote services with Java primitives fail
A remote service with functions that contain Java primitives as arguments cannot be called.
For example:
public interface MyService
{
void update(long value);
}
If you attempt to call update() remotely, you will get a NoSuchMethodException.
The root cause of the problem is in org.eclipse.ecf.core.util.reflection.ClassUtil line 68:
clazzA.isAssignableFrom(clazzB)
will return false if one class is a primitive and the other is the object form of the primitive.

The workaround is to change all primitive arguments to their object form.
 For example:
public interface MyService
{
void update(Long value);
}
