Bug 256975 – [remoteservices] add RemoteServiceTracker utility class
A normal service tracker is used like this:
ServiceTracker st = new ServiceTracker(...);
st.open();
IMyInterface service = (IMyInterface) st.getService();
...use service here...
The idea is that with a RemoteServiceTracker the usage would be similar:
RemoteServiceTracker rst = new RemoteServiceTracker(...);
rst.open();
IRemoteService rservice = rst.getService();
...use rservice here...e.g.
IMyInterface intf = (IMyInterface) rservice.getProxy(), or rservice.callAsynch(...), or others.
