Bug 228882 – [Discovery][slp][provider] SLP not getting service properties
Build ID: M20071023-1652
Steps To Reproduce:
I'd like to request an additional method in IDiscoveryContainerAdapter to query the service properties of a given service.
Currently the only way to get the service properties is by calling getServices() to find the service info.
However, jslp provider for ECF does not implement it yet.
Thus, I have no way to use ECF discovery to find the property of the service.
