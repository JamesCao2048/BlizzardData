Bug 277573 – [RemoteService] Make remote service identifiable in service registry by setting org.osgi.service.remoteserviceadmin.RemoteConstants.ENDPOINT_[SERVICE_ID|ID]
Currently a remote service is completely stripped of its properties when added to the local service registry.
This makes it impossible to identify e.g.
the remote endpoint.
Thus we shall set ServicePublication.ENDPOINT_ID to e.g.
org.eclipse.ecf.remoteservice.Constants.SERVICE_CONTAINER_ID + "#" + org.eclipse.ecf.remoteservice.Constants.SERVICE_ID
