Bug 196541 – [wizards] Passwords get reset upon user input in the username field
The password text field appears to be cleared once you start changing the contents of the username text field if it can't load one from the cache.
I have noticed this behaviour in the MSN and XMPP wizards and not in IRC.
I'm not sure about the other providers at the moment.
