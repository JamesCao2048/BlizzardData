Bug 199336 – [IRC] Unable to close chatroom tab after wrong join command
Build ID: I20070625-1500
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Connect to an IRC server
2.
Type command '/join foobar'
3.
A new tab is opened and after a few seconds you'll get a connect error message.
4.
Now, you won't be able to close the chatroom tab.
I'm not an expert IRC user and sometimes I forget to use '#'.
Other IRC clients prepend '#' if the user made such mistake, so, it would be nice if IRC provider fixes the user input.
