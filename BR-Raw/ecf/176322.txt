Bug 176322 – Refactoring to move away from Eclipse's runtime bundle
The ECF code base should be examined to move away from various usage of Eclipse runtime classes.
They instead should move to Equinox specific things.
Here are some examples:
- use of Platform for the convenience methods (getExtensionRegistry, ...)
- use of Plugin to get debugging and logging info
- access to classes that are now in org.eclipse.equinox.common
