Bug 202958 – [ui] irc channel output copy/select all works incorrectly
Enter IRC channel (e.g.
#eclipse-dev).
Right click on the chat output text area to bring up Copy/Clear/Select All menu.
Choose Select All.
Expected:  That channel's text would be selected.
Actual:  The root container's (irc.freenode.net) output is selected rather than the channel's output.
