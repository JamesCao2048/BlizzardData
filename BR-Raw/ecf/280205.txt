Bug 280205 – P2 Installer fails sometimes to install large products from P2 repositories whose artefacts are compressed with pack200
Installing large products Using P2 Installer 3.5RC3 or RC4, Sun JDK 1.5.0 or 1.6.0 fails because pack200 problems.
I'm getting the following log entry
!ENTRY org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine 4 4 2009-06-10 17:42:21.635

The JarProcessor produces an empty jar file although the downloaded compressed artifact is not empty.
This error cannot be reproduced each time.
It occurs with different artifacts while installing the same product.
I haven't found where exactly the problem is or how to reproduce it.
