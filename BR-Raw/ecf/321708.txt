Bug 321708 – Modularize XMPP provider WRT to remoteservices and datashare dependencies
provider.xmpp depends on remoteservices/provider.remoteservices as well as datashare/provider.datashare just to implement an adapter that gets activated iff consumers use the xmpp provider for remoteservices or datashare.
Following the divide and conquer metapher, those two dependencies should be refactored into fragements that allow consumers to add remoteservice/datashare functionality at deploy time.
