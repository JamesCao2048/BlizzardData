Bug 274821 – HttpClientFieldSystem's throwing of LoginException causes problems.
The HttpClientFieldSystem throws javax.security.auth.login.LoginException, and this class isn't in the Foundation 1.1 class library profile that p2 targets.
Currently p2 has to check against the class name to process this exception.
File system browser throws this exception on HTTP status 401, 403, and 407.
It is questionable if a 403 is a login problem - The RFC [1] states, "The server understood the request,
but is refusing to fulfill it.
Authorization will not help and the request
SHOULD NOT be repeated" - i.e.
it does not help to login.
Currently, p2 has to parse the exception message text to find the string "Forbidden" to differentiate.
