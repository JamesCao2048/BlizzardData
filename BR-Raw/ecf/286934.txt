Bug 286934 – [xmpp] Disconnected users with resource IDs not removed from roster
Created attachment 144809 [details]
Test case
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Connect a user with a resource ID (user@host/resource).
2.
Disconnect the user.
3.
Connect the same user with a different resource ID (user@host/resource2).
=> The user now appears twice in the roster, once with the old and once with the new resource.
If resource IDs are generated randomly, this causes disconnected entries to be never removed.
The attached patch contains a new test case that fails due to this problem.
