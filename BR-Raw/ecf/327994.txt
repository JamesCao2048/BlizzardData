Bug 327994 – [remoteservices][test] TwitterRemoteServiceTest failing to connect to twitter service
The TwitterRemoteServiceTest is failing in automated builds...apparently because of some issue with accessing the twitter API/service (possibly authentication/account in automated test environment, perhaps something changed in twitter service, etc).
For an example of the test failures, see
