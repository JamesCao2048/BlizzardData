Bug 180751 – [UI] MultiRosterContentProvider should not have objects tacked onto it
An IContentProvider is supposed to interpret a given input and return Objects that corresponds to the backend model for the UI to render.
However, the MultiRosterContentProvider appears to be storing Objects themselves with its add and remove methods and reading them that way.
Adding and removing is something that the viewer calls and not the content provider, which would explain why viewers have add/remove methods whereas content providers don't.
