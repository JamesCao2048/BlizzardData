Bug 316071 – Problem registering and/or finding remote services
Build Identifier: ECF 3.0.0.v20090831
I have a simple example using the remote services API with XMPP (specifically, XMPPS via Google).
 My application logs in to a GMail account and registers a service.
 When I run two instances of the application on one computer, each instance is able to find an IRemoteServiceReference to the other.
 But when I run two instances of the application on two separate machines, one of them is able to find a reference to the other, but not the other way around.
 I apologize that I don't have any more information.
 No exceptions are thrown, and I didn't notice anything suspect when I stepped through IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.getRemoteServiceReferences().
Also, I'm not sure if this is significant, but when I call getRemoteServiceReferences(), I actually do get an IRemoteServiceReference, but it's a pointer to my own remote service, not the other user's remote service.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Set up a remote service (call it RS1) on machine 1.
2.
Set up a remote service (call it RS2) on machine 2.
3.
Try to look up RS1 from machine 2 and RS2 from machine 1.
4.
One of the lookups will work, and the other will not.
