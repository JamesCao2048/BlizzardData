Bug 230182 – [Discovery][SLP] priority, weight and protocol unset
The jSLP currently doesn't set priority, weight and protocol on discovered services.
Instead it sets default values.
Also these values are ignored on services which are registered via org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.IDiscoveryContainerAdapter.registerService(IServiceInfo).
