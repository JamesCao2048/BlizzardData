Bug 166603 – Authentication failure information not being returned to client
See description of problem below.
 Basic problem:  In org.eclipse.ecf.provider.generic.ServerSOContainer.acceptNewClient null is returned in response to SecurityException thrown during checkJoin.
 It should return a non-null object (the exception probably).
--------
I just test with getCause() and it don't return any additional
information that can help me to distinguish Security/Connection
exception.
Sorry for my bad english, i'm an italian student at University of
Salerno, i working on LEAD project (www.lead2learning.org) and we want
to use ECF as communication/collaboration framework.
thanks in advance :-)
