Bug 324333 – remote service exception results in client timeout
If a remote service throws an exception, the client will timeout instead of receive the exception.
 To reproduce, modify the org.eclipse.ecf.examples.remoteservices.hello example such that the hello() in IHello throws an exception, then change the host bundle implementation to actually throw the declared exception.
 Run the host and client.
 The client will timeout.
