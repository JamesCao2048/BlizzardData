Bug 324215 – [remoteserviceadmin][remoteservices] implement remote services admin spec
In OSGi 4.2 enterprise spec chapter 122 is the remote services admin specification.
 As of version 3.3, ECF fully implements the remote services spec (chapter 13 in compendium), but ECF does not yet implement the remote services admin spec.
This enhancement would be to implement the remote services admin spec upon the ECF discovery API, ECF remote services API, and the ECF OSGi remote services implementation.
