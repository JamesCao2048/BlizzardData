Bug 274632 – HttpClientFileSystemBrowser#runRequest needs to return HTTP status code
HttpClientFileSystemBrowser, (indeed File system browsers in general)
should return an error code to make it possible for the caller to understand the nature of a communication error.
In p2, the current solution is to parse the message text in the IOException thrown in HttpClientFileSystemBrowser#runRequest.
As these messages can be translated, the current implementation is brittle.
Suggested fix for 3.5: The smallest possible change is to introduce a subclass of IOException that includes an integer code.
Callers that expect an IOException will not notice, but p2 can exploit the new class.
