Bug 261438 – [filetransfer] add way to defeat protocol factory extension contributions
In the filetransfer provider are extension points browseFileTransferProtocolFactory, sendFileTransferProtocolFactory, retrieveFileTransferProtocolFactory, that allow plugins to insert themselves into the browse, send, retrieve calls.
Occasionally, it would be useful to be able to specify plugins to exclude from contributing browse, send, or retrieve factories.
We should add a system property:  org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.excludeContributors
that allows contributors to be excluded from adding protocol factories.
 For example:
-Dorg.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.excludeContributors=org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.httpclient
should prevent the httpclient provider from adding any of it's contributions to the protocol factories.
