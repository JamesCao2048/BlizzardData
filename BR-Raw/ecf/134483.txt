Bug 134483 – Standalone ClientApplication is breaks in line 137 since ContainerFactory uses ECFPlugin
The standalone org.eclipse.ecf.provider.app.ClientApplication.init (line 72) throws an ExceptionInInitializerError, since the ContainerFactory references the ECFPlugin in the contructor.
The ClientApplication is standalone (i.e  it doesn't not run in Eclipse or in an Eclipse Rich Client), so (I think) the ECFPlugin is never initialised and thus the "ECFPlugin.getDefault()" throws a NullPointerExcepton.
A previous version of ECF (I think v0.62) worked ok, since in this version the ContainerFactory did not yet use the ECFPlugin.
