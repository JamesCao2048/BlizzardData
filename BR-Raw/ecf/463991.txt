Bug 463991 – add service for accessing EndpointDescriptionLocator functionality
Currently, Endpoints are discovered, updated, or removed via either a) edef files in started bundles; b) ecf discovery providers.
 It would also be useful to allow programmatic access to discovering, updating, and removing Endpoint descriptions, so that (e.g.) the Endpoint Discovery View can do this when requested by the user.
