Bug 267481 – [server] supporrt remoteservice container adapter in generic server
The AbstractGenericServer class does not support the IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter, because the GenericServerContainer is an inner, protected class...and the plugin.xml in org.eclipse.ecf.server.generic does not include an adapter factory for IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.
To support this adapter
1) Move GenericServerContainer into a top-level class
2) Add markup to plugin.xml to support an adapter factory for IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter
