Bug 441455 – [Discovery][zookeeper] Using serviceTypeID.getInternal() as id for serviceInfo does not provide uniqueness
In the OSGI CT tests there is a test
org.osgi.test.cases.remoteserviceadmin.junit.DiscoveryTest.testDiscovery____RSA_1_1___basicEndpointEvents()
That results in two service infos being published for a remote service...the initial one and a second one to represent the properties update.
  The zookeeper provider was failing to publish the second advertisement because the following code returning prior to publishing the second service info (published) in WatchManager.java
-		String serviceid = published.getServiceID().getServiceTypeID()
-				.getInternal();
-		if (getNodeWriters().containsKey(serviceid))
-			return;
The serviceid for both published values was
_ecfosgirsvc._default.default._iana
returned by the call to published.getServiceID().getServiceTypeID().getInternal().
This code seems to be based upon the assumption that the call to getServiceTypeID().getInternal() (as oppsoed to the serviceID itself) is *unique* for every service (hence the variable name 'serviceid').
 This is not correct, as the serviceid is unique, but the service type id (internal) is not necessarily unique.
I believe that the unique String value for 'serviceid' is something like:
String serviceid = published.getServiceID().getName();
Using this, the serviceid will be/is unique.
