Bug 328142 – [Discovery][Composite] Registering an IService(Type)Listener with OSGi service registry results in listeners notified twice
If a consumer registers its IService(Type)Listeners via the OSGi whiteboard pattern while using the CompositeDiscoveryProvider, listeners will receive discovery events twice.
The second discovery event originates from the nested discovery provider inside the CompositeDiscoveryProvider.
In general it is questionable if the CompositeDiscoveryProvider makes sense in the OSGi context where the OSGi service registry/whiteboard pattern takes over the CompositeDiscoveryProvider functionality WRT listener handling.
