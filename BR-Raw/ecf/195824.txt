Bug 195824 – JMDNSDiscoveryContainer$1 doesn't forward getProperty()?
I had a piece of code in the service resolved which was printing out a property
public void serviceResolved(IServiceEvent arg0) {
System.out.println("Resolved service "
+ arg0 + "\n" +
arg0.getServiceInfo().getServiceProperties().getProperty("RandomName"));
}
This was returning null, despite me setting it when I registered the service (via new ServiceProperties).
To avoid user idiociy (well, I had to rule that out first), I debugged it and the value was there.
Turns out getServiceProperties().getStringProperty("RandomName") gives me a value, but getProperty("RandomName") gives null.
I wonder if there's a missing forward?
It's in the JMDNSDiscoveryContainer$1 class, which is likely to be the IServicePRoperties implementation in the JMDNSDiscoveryContainer class, I'm guessing.
