Bug 342356 – [TCK] RSA override properties handling incomplete
My reading/understanding of o.e.e.osgi.services.remoteserviceadmin.RemoteServiceAdmin.exportService(ServiceReference, Map<String, Object>) javadoc is, that the implementation is supposed to override any properties in the service reference with the one provided in the Map (except the explicitly excluded ones).
Right now this is only done for the exported interfaces, intents and exported configs.
However neither o.e.e.osgi.services.remoteserviceadmin.IHostContainerSelector.selectHostContainers(ServiceReference, String[], String[], String[]) nor o.e.e.osgi.services.remoteserviceadmin.IHostContainerSelector.selectHostContainers(ServiceReference, String[], String[], String[]) actually allow overriding properties to be passed in.
This e.g.
results in "ecf.exported.containerfactoryargs" being ignored by the host container selector.
