Bug 274604 – ColaSynchronizationStrategy instantiates new Booleans unnecessarily
The getInstanceFor(ID, boolean) method has the following:
Boolean existingStrategyIsInitiator = new Boolean(existingStrategy.isInitiator);
if (existingStrategyIsInitiator.equals(new Boolean(isInitiator))) {
return existingStrategy;
}
There seems to no reason to why new Boolean objects need to be instantiated when the boolean primitives could be compared directly.
