Bug 295030 – Update Manager doesn't work with SOCKS proxy
The Update Manager does not work with a SOCKS proxy (at least not in the common scenario of the update site being an http URL).
It seem equally broken in 3.5.1 and 3.6M3.
Try in an eclipse instance that ONLY has a SOCKS server specified (native, and no http or https proxy), with the userid and password stored in the proxy definition.
Then bring up the update manager.
You'll see that you get prompted for a SOCKS userid/password, which is the first sign that things are going wrong (it shouldn't prompt since you provided that information in the proxy definition).
In this scenario, the socket connection at least succeeds (set a breakpoint in SocketEventCreateUtil.createSocket()), but alas the ecf plugin ends up unable to identify an http server.
But it gets worse.
Now try in an instance where you have both a SOCKS proxy and an HTTP one configured.
In this situation, no only do you, again, get prompted for a SOCKS userid/password (which equally makes no sense in this case), but the SocketEventCreateUtil.createSocket() logic fails to even connect.
