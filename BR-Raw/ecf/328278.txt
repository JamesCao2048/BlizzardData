Bug 328278 – [Discovery][Composite] CompositeDiscoveryContainer not correctly disposed on ServiceFactory.ungetService(...)
The CompositeDiscoveryContainer is never disposed of by the ServiceFactory in org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.discovery.Activator.start(BundleContext).
This leaves lingering container around with nested even more discovery containers (that still fire events).
