Bug 198012 – [ui] generic provider connect id does not receive value from hyperlink
For ECF hyperlinks of the form:
ecftcp://localhost:3282/server
The hyperlink activation should
1) Open the connect dialog
2) Set the connect ID to:  ecftcp://localhost:3282/server
The current behavior does 1, but not 2.
