Bug 218308 – [Discovery][jSLP] org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.IDiscoveryContainerAdapter.getServices() doesn't return all "reachable" services
Contrary to JMDNS, org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.IDiscoveryContainerAdapter.getServices() doesn't return all "reachable" (in terms of network reachability etc.) services.
This is because per RFC a ServiceRequest/ServiceTypeRequest cannot be set to be valid for all scopes.
Only the default scope (if omitted) or the given scope list is considered.
Unfortunately manually discovering of all available scopes before sending the ServiceRequest isn't possible, because it is unsupported by the RFC.
Technically jSLP itself could be enhanced to at least use all known scopes (e.g.
obtained via a DAAdvertisement), but a DAAdv doesn't necessarily contain all scopes.
