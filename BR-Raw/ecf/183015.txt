Bug 183015 – Make ECF icons look closer to other Eclipse icons
Make ECF icons look closer to other Eclipse icons.
Color of the current icons is too bright and distracting.
Even comparing with blue color used in other Eclipse icons (i.e.
folder icons) they are considerably brighter.
I think colors should not be visually shouting and should fit nicely with other Eclipse icons.
Maybe ECF can get some help from Eclipse/Platform icon designers (i.e.
Kimberley Peter).
