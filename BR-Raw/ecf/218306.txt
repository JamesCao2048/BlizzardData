Bug 218306 – [Discovery][jSLP][JMDNS] URI scheme in JMDNS is always set to "jmdns" while jSLP sets it depending on the actual SLP ServiceReply
org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.IServiceInfo.getLocation().getScheme() in JMDNS is always set to "jmdns" while jSLP sets the same field depending on ch.ethz.iks.slp.ServiceURL.getProtocol().
This should be aligned.
But to what?
Personally I'd propose to adopt the jSLP behavior for ECF discovery, because the benefit for the consumer is higher.
Also setting it to "jmdns" unnecessarily exposes the actual discovery provider which should, if required at all, be accessible via some ECF "reflection".
