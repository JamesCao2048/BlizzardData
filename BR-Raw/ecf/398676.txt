Bug 398676 – Remove system property to change default protocol
Currently, there is a system property that allows the TCPServerSOContainer.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL and the SSLServerSOContainer.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL to be set/reset via system property.
 These two defaults (i.e.
"ecftcp" and "ecfssl" as the default protocols), cannot and should not be changed (via system property or any other way), so the system properties are not needed in this case.
