Bug 321468 – [remoteservices][generic] RegistrySharedObject should dispatch remote service listener events asynchronously
Currently, in RegistrySharedObject.fireRemoteServiceListeners the dispatch to the registered listeners is synchronous.
 This has the result that if the code inside the IRemoteServiceListener attempts to access the remote service (e.g.
to invoke a remote call), this will deadlock.
The fix is to dispatch remote service listener events asynchronously via a ListenerQueue.
