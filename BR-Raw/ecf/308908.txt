Bug 308908 – [irc] [bot] Bot forgets preset commands if it fails to write browseable version
org.eclipse.ecf.internal.presence.bot.kosmos.ChatRoomMessageHandler#ChatRoomMessageHandler() , after parsing the preset command regexps attempts to write out a HTML reference version to disk for later use.
 If that write fails, it clears the list of known commands and renders the bot inert.
 It should only clear the list if there's a problem in loading the commands.
