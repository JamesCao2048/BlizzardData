Bug 246155 – Support for multiple user log-ins with same username and password
Build ID: ?
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create XMPP user ID
2.
Try to log-in with the same ID several times
3.
More information:
In companies where users have to work on several PCs at the same time they need to connect to an application several times as well by using their username and password.
Please see the concerns Scott has below:
The current implementation of XMPPIDs does not take the resourcename into account when testing for equality (e.g.
"slewis@ecf.eclipse.org".equals("slewis@ecf.eclipse.org/ecf_client15")), so this may cause some issues with identifying and addressing specific remote instances.
 If so we can/will fix the xmppid implementation...so please let me know how this goes.
