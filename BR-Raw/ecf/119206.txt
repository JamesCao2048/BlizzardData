Bug 119206 – Add 'event history' as hyperlinks to collab text chat output
A problem with the shared editor in the collab example is that there is no history.
 If a participant opens a shared editor the receiver does not have any record of that shared editor opening, and no way to 'replay' that event under there own control.
The shared editor in the ECF collab example can use the following features:
1) The display of editor opening and editor selection events in the chat text output (as hyperlinks)
2) The ability to have the receiver click on the hyperlinks and to locally (and/or remotely) 'replay' the event.
3) Allow the receiver to specify (as a preference) whether the received events will be immediately executed (as the shared editor is now) OR not immediately executed by presented in the text chat history
4) Provide some additional UI for specifying what events (and associated resources) to share (e.g.
key board?)
