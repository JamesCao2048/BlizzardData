Bug 194977 – Inconsitency in parameter name in org.eclipse.ecf.core.IContainerFactory.createContainer(descriptionName)
Build ID: I20070625-1500
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
See source.
More information:
The extension point "org.eclipse.ecf.containerFactory" has the attribute "name" which nicely explains what the attribute is about.
The org.eclipse.ecf.core.IContainerFactory has a method createContainer(descriptionName) where the descriptionName describes the "name" attribute in the containerFactory extension point.
It is misleading to read descriptionName here as there is also a description attribute in the containerFactory.
So either the attribute is entitled "descriptionName" or the parameter descriptionName is entitled "name" (which i would prefer).
