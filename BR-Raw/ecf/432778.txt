Bug 432778 – With removal of dependency on extension registry, make handling of supported configs dynamic
With bug 421569 ECF has an approach that allows Namespaces and ContainerTypeDescriptions to be registered dynamically (via OSGi services) rather than the extension registry.
The OSGi RS specification dictates that the standard service property 'remote.configs.supported' will be set.
 With ECF's ability to dynamically add/remove distributions providers at runtime, it's necessary to make dynamic the setting/updating of this service property (on the RemoteServiceAdmin implementation).
