Bug 264126 – BREE should include Foundation 1.1 as much as possible
It is very useful for the ECF bundles to include Foundation 1.1 (if not Foundation 1.0) in their BREE declaration wherever possible.
 In a couple cases (e.c., o.e.ecf.ssl) only Java 1.4 is listed.
 This means that the bundle cannot be used on Foundation 1.?
