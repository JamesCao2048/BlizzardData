Bug 226608 – make IContainerEjectedEvent .getSerializable return a Throwable
The reason I ask for this is that some clients have a need to know exactly why they have been disconnected (ie., what was the root exception that caused the ejection event).
They need this event to be able to act on it in some fashion.
In the short term, returning a throwable might be the quick fix...
