Bug 219878 – [core] fix deprecated Eclipse-LazyStart manifest entries
Currently, a number of ECF bundles have Eclipse-LazyStart manifest entries, which are specific to Equinox.
 OSGi 4 supports a new manifest entry:
Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy
that we should use to make ECF bundles portable across runtimes.
The recommended procedure is to add Bundle-ActivationPolicy and leave Eclipse-LazyStart manifest entries for backward compatibility.
