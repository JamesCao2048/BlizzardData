Bug 424262 – Add support for distribution provider-specified EndpointDescription properties
As described by Thomas Calmant

It also implements IOSGiRemoteServiceContainerAdapter as I need to view all service properties.

This enhancement should allow distribution providers to add/change properties that end up being added to the EndpointDescription.
One implementation mechanism could be to simply read the properties from the remoteRegistration returned from IOSGiRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.registerRemoteService...or IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.registerRemoteService
on line 2020 o 2031 of RemoteServiceAdmin class...and override and/or add these remoteRegistration properties to the endpointDescriptionProperties variable prior to the creation of the EndpointDescription (line 2039 of RemoteServiceAdmin).
