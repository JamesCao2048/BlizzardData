Bug 234342 – Improved retrieval of remote filename
This patch will make the UrlConnectionRetrieveFileTransfer use the URL of the resolved connection as the last resort.
This is different from the original URL since the connection in some cases automatically resolves redirects.
This fix will make the UrlConnectionRetrieveFileTransfer behave the same as the HttpCLientConnectionRetrieveFileTransfer.
