Bug 19733 – [content assist] Code assist closes when the list would filter to 0 items
Code assist closes when the list would filter to 0 items.
 This means, for
example, that mistyping a method name will close code assist forcing you to
reopen it after backspacing over the incorrect character.
A better approach would be to jump to the entries in the list as you type
instead of filtering the list.
 This would have the following advantages:
1) Mistyping does not close code assist.
 Simply backspace and type the
correct charater and code assist will continue to follow.
2) If you begin typing something (a method name for example) then realize
that you don't remember the name of what you are looking for, you can just
scroll through the list.
 Currently, you have to completely backspace over what
you typed (to restore all filtered items) and then scroll through the list.
3) Should also be faster as eclipse does not have to keep regenerating the
list -- it only has to select the first item that matches what you have typed so
far.
This is how Visual Studio 6 implements code assist, which I have found to be
very useful and unobtrusive.
