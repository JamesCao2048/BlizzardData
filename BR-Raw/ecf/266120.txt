Bug 266120 – [Discovery][JmDNS] IServiceTypeID has always default naming authority set
Zeroconf service types don't include the naming authority.
Thus, for ECF, it is transfered as part of the service properties.
This causes servicetypes returned by getServiceTypeIDs to always have the default naming authority set.
