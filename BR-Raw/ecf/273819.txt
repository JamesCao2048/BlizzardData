Bug 273819 – Containers are instantiated every time a wizard opens
Somehow, this feels kind of wrong.
The container is also not disposed when the wizard closes (if the user cancels the dialog).
Should it?
Currently, every time the wizard is opened and closed, a thread is started (per bug 266817) and as far as I can tell, runs forever.
