Bug 198132 – [IRC] client occassionally says "null"
When using IRC client it occassionally says "null".
Sometimes on public channel, sometimes on private.
"null" is really sent to the irc server, as I observed it having conversation between two clients: chatzilla and ECF.
Chatzilla printed that ECF client said "null".
that may be effect of intensive BugDay efforts.
