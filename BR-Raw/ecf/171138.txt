Bug 171138 – Static collection of created IContainers needed
Currently, the RosterView disconnects all connected IContainers when the view is closed (in the dispose()) method.
This is unintuitive as all modern IM applications allows the user to minimize the contacts listings window to the system tray.
While Eclipse does not have a "system tray" (fast view-ing doesn't count), it doesn't mean that we should automagically disconnect.
This is a grave violation of the "principle of least astonishment".
We should introduce some concept of a "ContainerManager".
I'm guessing we can hook created IContainers onto the manager right before the ContainerFactory's createContainer(ContainerTypeDescription, Object[]) method call returns?
