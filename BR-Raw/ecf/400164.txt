Bug 400164 – Add API to allow customization of proxy creation
Currently the remote services proxy creation is accomplished by
AbstractRemoteService.createProxy/2
In order to customize the proxy creation it's currently necessary to subclass AbstractRemoteService and override createProxy.
It would be much easier if a new whiteboard pattern service was available, called IRemoteServiceProxyCreator that would allow the proxy creation to be dynamically customized by providing a IRemoteServiceProxyCreator with an appropriate service ranking...and then that creator would be used rather than the default.
