Bug 223207 – [filetransfer][api] More generic handling of lastModified timestamp
Created attachment 92923 [details]
Patch to generilize handling of lastModified timestamp
The URLConnectionRetrieveFileTransfer and HttpClientRetrieveFileTransfer both obtain the 'lastModifiedTime' from the header fields for subsequent use when doing interrupted file transfer.
This timestamp can be very useful when creating a local cache and it is not uncommon for remote protocols to support it.
The attached patch will make the lastModified timestamp generally available in the IIncomingFileTransfer interface.
It adds the needed functionality for the EFS provider as well (+ EFS support for getRemoteFileName()).
I did not find a way to do this with SCP although I'm not a wiz in that area so perhaps that's possible too.
