Bug 263858 – Missing project specific settings
Created attachment 124867 [details]

Working on a patch affecting bundles:
org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.httpclient
org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.httpclient.ssl
While reviewing my changes I noticed that there were a lot more changes than the lines that I edited.
This should be caused by the missing setup of some project specific settings.
When I go through the property pages for project org.eclipse.ecf the following pages have 'Enable project specific settings' checked:
Java Code Style
Formatter [x]
Organize Imports [x]
Java Compiler [x]
Building [x]
Errors/Warnings[x]
Javadoc [x]
Java Editor
Save Actions [x]
See also attachments for a snapshot of the values I see.
However in project org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.httpclient only
Java Compiler
Errors/Warnings[x]
Java Editor
Save Actions [x]
For project org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.httpclient.ssl
Java Code Style
Organize Imports [x]
Java Compiler
Building [x]
Errors/Warnings[x]
Java Editor
Save Actions [x]
Assuming that project org.eclipse.ecf is a good role model I copied
/org.eclipse.ecf/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs into the two projects (overwriting existing settings).
I had to restart my workbench to have the settings take effect in the property pages UI! Is this a known issue?
Anyway if these changed settings are the way to go, please save each file in these projects to normalize their current content.
This way we will have a simpler time to figure out things that actually changed.
