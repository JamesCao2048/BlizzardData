Bug 256767 – Discovery view may be incapable of handling duplicate elements
If there are identical elements within the viewer, update and refresh requests will not work properly because it will only modify the first element that is found.
Invoking setUseHashlookup(true) on the StructuredViewer instance should resolve this.
