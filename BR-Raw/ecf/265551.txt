Bug 265551 – pause reads entire resource for HttpClient provider
I noticed this while working on URLRetrievePauseResumeTest.
See attached patch.
I noticed that when I changed PAUSE_TIME, that the tests sometimes did not resume.
I changed the tests to fail in that case.
I found that the reason for this is that when the transfer is paused the entire resource was still read.
If the resume comes before that happened then the test fails.
