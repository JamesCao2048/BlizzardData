Bug 263537 – Lots of warnings in Problem View
This effects more than just ecf.core, but bugzilla made me choose one
I am using Eclipse 3.4.1 plus Java 1.6.0 SR1 (J9) as my environment.
Otherwise I am following the steps described at http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/dev_resources.php.
In summary:
1.
Make a CVS connection to ':pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/rt'
2.
check out from HEAD of project at org.eclipse.ecf/releng/plugins/org.eclipse.ecf.releng
3.
Import project set projectSet-anonymous.psf
The instruction of step 2 seem wrong on the wiki as it says to go to get org.eclipse.releng from org.eclipse.ecf/builds/plugins/ which does not exist.
After the subsequent build there are 1376 Warnings in the Problems View.
I am aware that ECF uses Equinox Coding Conventions and presumably all its projects have the proper JDT Core and JDT UI preferences in the project specific preferences linked from http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/documents/coding.php.
Shouldn't there be 0 warnings?
One possibility would be to adjust the coding conventions to eliminate some non problematic warnings.
A particular candidate is the warning about being able to increase performance by increasing visibility or enclosing class members.
I would think this is questionable advice.
Here is an example:
Read access to enclosing field ChatRoomManagerView.ChatRoomTab.tabItem is emulated by a synthetic accessor method.
Increasing its visibility will improve your performance
ChatRoomManagerView.java line 1531
There are similar warnings for access to constructor/methods and also for write access.
I counted a total of 389 similar warnings:
125 synthetic ctor/message
237 synthetic read of fields
27 synthetic write access.
Some of the warnings probably relate to incomplete setup steps on the wiki:
95 warnings: Build path specifies execution environment CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0.
There are no JREs in the workspace strictly compatible with this environment.
81 warnings: An API baseline has not been set for the current workspace.
Of course there are lots of other warnings as well many of which should probably be addressed by making the appropriate code changes.
What to do?
