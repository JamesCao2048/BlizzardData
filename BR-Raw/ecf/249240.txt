Bug 249240 – [remotesvcs] Implement RFC 119
ECF can/could be the first reference implementation for RFC 119.
 We should work with the alliance, and RFC authors to create such a reference implementation using the ECF remote services API (and/or modify as necessary).
 An early draft of RFC 119 is available here
