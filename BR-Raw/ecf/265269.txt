Bug 265269 – ServiceTypeID to EMF URI conversion broken
Hi !
In the class org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.ui.model.resource.ServiceResource
the conversion of ServiceTypeID to EMF URI is broken.
A ServiceTypeID like
'odbms._vodagent._rmi.default._versant'
is now converted to
'ecf://odbms/vodagent/rmi.default/versant'
instead of
'ecf://odbms/vodagent/rmi/default/versant'
This seems to come from changing the 'org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.ui.model' plugin to CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1,J2SE-1.4
For that change the java.lang.String.replaceFirst(..) and java.lang.String.replaceAll(..)
has been replaced by the
org.eclipse.ecf.core.util.StringUtils.replaceFirst(..) and org.eclipse.ecf.core.util.StringUtils.replaceAll(..)
But is seems that these Methods doesn't support regex, which are used here in ServiceResource.
Attached is the simplest solution by changing ServiceResource to not use a regex.
( the regex was originaly required because '.' is a key for regex, so it had to be quoted)
