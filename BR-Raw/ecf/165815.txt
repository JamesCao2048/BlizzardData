Bug 165815 – Local access to local remoteservicereference not implemented
Hi Paul,
Please file this as a bug.
 The reason is simply that the local access to locally registered remoteservices (i.e.
remoteContainerOne calling getRemoteServiceReferences for a remoteservice it has registered) is not yet implemented.
I'll address the other issues in another posting.
