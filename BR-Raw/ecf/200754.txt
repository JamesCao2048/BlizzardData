Bug 200754 – [discovery] DiscoveryServiceTest does not pass
The AllTests test suite in the discovery tests plug-in does not actually include DiscoveryServiceTest.
But the real problem is that the DiscoveryServiceTest does not pass.
testAddServiceTypeListener - failure
testRegisterServiceType - error
testRegisterService - error
testDiscovery - pass
Surely they must've passed at the time of writing, but they don't anymore.
Markus brought this up on IRC this morning and I have confirmed it on my computer.
