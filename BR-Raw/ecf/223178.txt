Bug 223178 – "BitTrrent" is not displayed in the drop-down-list of "Connect to Provider" button in the tool-bar
Build ID: 2.0.0.v20080315-2247
Steps To Reproduce:
I used it with Eclipse 3.3.2.
"BitTrrent" is not displayed in the drop-down-list of "Connect to Provider"
button in the tool-bar.
Can "BitTrrent" be used only at Eclipse 3.4 or more?
Moreover, the file transfer view cannot be displayed.
It is not in the view list.
I want to ask for the correction of MANIFEST.MF if this is a bug.
1) org.eclipse.ecf.examples.updatesite.server
org.eclipse.equinox.app;bundle-version="1.0.100"
=>  "1.0.1"
2) org.eclipse.ecf.filetransfer.ui
org.eclipse.jface.text;bundle-version="3.4.0"
=> "3.3.0"
