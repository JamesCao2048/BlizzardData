Bug 229237 – [presence][ui] xmpps accounts can appear twice in contacts list
When creating a connection to (e.g.) the XMPPS provider for the first time, when the contacts list view has not yet been shown, the same account (e.g.
slewis@ecf.eclipse.org) can be added twice (MultiRosterView.addContainer called twice).
When the connect ui opens the view i.e.
in XMPPConnectWizard.performFinish (this block is executed via Display.asyncExec())
private void openView() {
try {
final MultiRosterView view = (MultiRosterView) workbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage().showView(MultiRosterView.VIEW_ID);
view.addContainer(container);
} catch (final PartInitException e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
When showView(MultiRosterView.VIEW_ID) is called the first time, this triggers the MultiRosterView.setupTreeViewer, which calls MultiRosterView.retrieveServices().
In MRV.retrieveServices is a block that looks for IPresenceServices and if found adds the associated container via MRV.addContainer:
private void retrieveServices() {
IPresenceService[] services = Activator.getDefault().getPresenceServices();
for (int i = 0; i < services.length; i++) {
IContainer container = (IContainer) services[i].getAdapter(IContainer.class);
if (container != null && container.getConnectedID() != null) {
addContainer(container);
}
}
}
Because the openView block is run asynchronously, retrieveServices can find the newly connected container exposed as an IPresenceService...immediately after the container connect notification (in xmpp provider).
 Then, the 			view.addContainer(container) call is *also* made (via openView()), and the same container/account is added twice.
Remy what do you think is the appropriate fix?  It's not changing the asyncExec to a syncExec (this can/does result in deadlock).
 It could be
1) removing retrieveServices() (but would this have other negative side effects?)
2) Adding a check in addContainer for the prior existence of a given container and not adding it if already present?
