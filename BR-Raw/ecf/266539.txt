Bug 266539 – [Discovery][ui] zeroconf services not being shown in ui
With latest from head, I'm not seeing some iTunes services shown in the discovery ui.
 I also happen to see these info notices in the error log:
!ENTRY org.eclipse.ecf.discovery.model 1 0 2009-02-27 10:31:50.984
!MESSAGE Cannot create a resource for 'ecf://192.168.100.11:80/tcp/local/iana'; a registered resource factory is needed
I'm not sure if this is related, but it seems that it could be.
