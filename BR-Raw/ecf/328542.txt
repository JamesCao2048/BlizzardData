Bug 328542 – [RemoteSrvs][Generic] Change default to use InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName() instead of "localhost"
The generic providers selects "localhost" as the default hostname if not given explicitly.
This fails for scenarios where services are to be remoted across different machines.
Thus the default should be changed to use InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName().
