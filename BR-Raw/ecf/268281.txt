Bug 268281 – [Discovery][jmdns] protocol incorrectly set to uri protocol
In JMDNSDiscoveryContainer line 407 is this:
final String proto = (uriProtocol == null) ? serviceInfo.getProtocol() : uriProtocol;
This should be this:
final String proto = serviceInfo.getProtocol();
As for jmdns the uriProtocol doesn't necessarily match the discovery protocol.
Fix is pending.
 I'll be committing to HEAD shortly.
