Bug 472106 – For non-OSGi environments (ServiceRegistry) allow to skip service interface version checking
In this method (impl of RemoteServiceAdmin service):
org.eclipse.ecf.osgi.services.remoteserviceadmin.RemoteServiceAdmin.createProxy(Bundle, ServiceReference, IRemoteService, Map<String, Version>)
There is this code:
// Now verify that the classes are of valid versions
if (!verifyServiceInterfaceVersionsForProxy(requestingBundle,
serviceInterfaceClasses, interfaceVersions))
return null;
which compares the serviceInterfaceClasses versions against available local versions and if no version match returns null (could not create proxy).
For the ServiceRegistry environment (no OSGi, no Bundle Wiring API support, etc) it should be possible to disable this version check.
  This could be implemented by a system property disabling this check.
