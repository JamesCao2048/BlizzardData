Bug 407710 – [TCK] RSA.createProxyProperties not overriding with EndpointDescription properties
Test Failure:  In tb3.Activator line 85, the filter is looking for newkey=newvalue.
 These overridden values are not found in the (xml/edef) imported endpoint description.
Analysis:  In org.eclipse.ecf.osgi.services.remoteserviceadmin.RemoteServiceAdmin.createProxyProperties(EndpointDescription,
IRemoteServiceContainer, IRemoteServiceReference, IRemoteService) line 1887, the ECF *remote service properties* are used to
create the proxy properties via line:
PropertiesUtil.copyNonReservedProperties(rsReference, resultProperties);
And this results in the properties *not* including newkey=newvalue (from the overriding properties).
The createProxyProperties should include all the non reserved properties from both both the
Proposed Fix:
Change line 1887 to:
PropertiesUtil.copyNonReservedProperties(rsReference, resultProperties);
PropertiesUtil.copyNonReservedProperties(endpointDescription.getProperties(), resultProperties);
So that *both the rsReference properties and the endpointDescription.getProperties()* are placed into the resultProperties.
Further, the endpointDescription.getProperties() should override any of the same values in rsReference.
