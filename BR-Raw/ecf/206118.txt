Bug 206118 – Trace utility should offer a trace method that takes class and method name
org.eclipse.ecf.core.util.Trace currently only offers:
trace(String pluginId, String message)
trace(String pluginId, String option, String message)
whereas other methods like entering, exiting, ...
all also take the class and method name.
Thus
race(String pluginId, String option, Class clazz, String methodName, String message)
should be added.
