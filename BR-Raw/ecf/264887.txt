Bug 264887 – correct/remove warnings on ECF projects
As part of ECF 3.0 release, I would like to remove the remaining compiler and manifest warnings from all ECF projects.
As of 2/13/2009 10:30am, here are the projects that are showing warnings that are *not deprecations* (I would like to leave the platform api deprecation warnings until they are properly dealt with).
 Note that this is with 3.5M5 platform and api baseline set to ECF 2.1.
discovery.ui.model
discovery.ui.properties.tabbed
(Markus lead?)
presence.ui
protocol.bittorrent
protocol.msn
org.eclipse.team.ecf.core
org.eclipse.team.ecf.ui
(Remy lead?)
Please either make the necessary code changes (if possible), or change the project-specific compiler settings (only if necessary) to eliminate the warnings.
Thanks
