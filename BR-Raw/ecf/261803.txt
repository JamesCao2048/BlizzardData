Bug 261803 – Increment org.eclipse.ecf.docshare minor version number and mark new API
org.eclipse.ecf.docshare has undergone a major refactoring in 3.0.
Various packages have been moved/renamed and the exported-packages header has  been extended.
From the APITooling perspective, this justifies a bundle minor version increment.
Addtionally new API should be marked with @since.
