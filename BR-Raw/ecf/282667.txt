Bug 282667 – [remotesrvs][r-osgi] class name parsing exception in ch.ethz.iks.r_osgi.impl.CodeAnalyzer
Hi, as described by Wojciech in bug 274982, we have some issues with CodeAnalyzer.
I'll paste that comment in this bug, since I believe ECF bug is better place to discuss this than PDE bug :-)

Ok, we've got an interesting issue :-)
Our remote service interface contains a method like this:
void addExtensionPoints(ExtensionPoint[] extensionPoints);
and when we try to register it, we get to the point where r-OSGI is analyzing
it (in ch.ethz.iks.r_osgi.impl.CodeAnalyzer.visit(String)) and is trying to
find type ExtensionPoint[].
It's trying to open class file named
"[Lorg/eclipse/pde/internal/runtime/registry/model/ExtensionPoint.class" - note
the '[' at the beginning.
This fails with IOException.
Does this mean, that we should not use arrays in our services?
