Bug 266483 – [Discovery][JmDNS] Replace outdated/inofficial "._mdns._udp." meta query with official "._dns-sd._udp."

Service Type Enumeration
In general, clients are not interested in finding *every* service on
the network, just the services that the client knows how to talk to.
However, for problem diagnosis and network management tools, it may
be useful for network administrators to find the list of advertised
service types on the network, even if those service names are just
opaque identifiers and not particularly informative in isolation.
For this reason, a special meta-query is defined.
A DNS query for PTR
records with the name "_services._dns-sd._udp.<Domain>" yields a list
of PTR records, where the rdata of each PTR record is the two-label
name of a service type, e.g.
"_http._tcp." These two-label service
types can then be used to construct subsequent Service Instance
Enumeration PTR queries, in this <Domain> or others, to discover
a list of instances of that service type.
