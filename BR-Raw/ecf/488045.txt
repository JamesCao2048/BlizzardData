Bug 488045 – ClassResolverObjectInputStream must close ServiceTracker
In ClassResolverObjectInputStream.resolveClass a ServiceTracker is opened, but it only gets closed if the close method is explicitly called.
The ServiceTracker (or some other way of getting appropriate whiteboard service) should be closed upon every invocation of resolveClass.
