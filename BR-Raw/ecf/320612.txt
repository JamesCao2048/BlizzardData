Bug 320612 – [Discovery] Unit tests fail due to broken detection of external ip address
IServiceInfos are compared for equality based on a couple of properties including the IP address.
If the expected IServiceInfo e.g.
has "127.0.0.1" set but the discovery provider binds to the external ip address of e.g.
"192.168.1.1" the checks fail.
Thus the tests have to take the behavior of the provider into account.
