Bug 209774 – Simplify/generalize discovery API (summary bug)
Hi,
for the ECF 2.0 (Ganymede) release we plan on simplifying and generalizing the discovery API.
The goals in general are:
- Make it easy for the API consumer
- The SPI should allow for easier implementation of new providers (SLP, JINI, JXTA, ...)
- Discovery doesn't have to be network-based anymore (e.g.
filesystem-based discovery of services)
