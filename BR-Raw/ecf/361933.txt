Bug 361933 – Handling response message in ECF when HTTP Status is different than OK 200
Build Identifier:
In case of expected server error (HTTP Status is not 200 (OK))
I get RestException with the proper status code and this text :
"Http response not OK.
 URL=http://..........
responseCode=505"
According to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.1 "User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user"
The problem is in this code (line 83):
http://git.eclipse.org/c/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.git/tree/framework/bundles/org.eclipse.ecf.remoteservice.rest/src/org/eclipse/ecf/remoteservice/rest/client/RestClientService.java
method invokeRemoteCall simply ignores response body (message) when HTTP status is not OK
I need a way to get the proper message returned from server and not the hardcoded "Http response not OK"
Thanks
and Best Regards,
Veselin Vasilev
