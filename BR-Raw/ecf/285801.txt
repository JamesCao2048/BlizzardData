Bug 285801 – Remove unnecessary host name lookups
Build ID: 20090619-0625
In org.eclipse.ecf.provider/src/org/eclipse/ecf/provider/comm/tcp/Client.java there are two calls to InetAddress.getHostName(), used to build a string representation of the endpoint.
 This method forces a reverse name lookup.
 When running on a network without DNS servers, this introduces connection delays of 30-60 seconds depending on OS configuration.
I'd like to propose that these be replaced with calls to InetAddress.getHostAddress() or even toString(), depending on how this string is actually used elsewhere in the system.
 Neither of these will result in a reverse name lookup, and the latter will include the hostname if it's already been cached by the system.
