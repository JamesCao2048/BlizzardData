Bug 266723 – [Discovery] specify how clients can determine service uniqueness
Currently, the ECF discovery API does not specify how discovered services can be reliably determined to be unique.
 In general, clients (i.e.
those that are discovering services via ECF IDiscoveryLocator) need to be able to reliably determine from the information in the events whether a serviceDiscovered/undiscovered notification is in reference to an existing service, or a new service.
