Bug 206528 – [bot] (KOS-MOS) should privately provide list of commands when asked
Build ID: n/a
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Join #eclipse
2.
Type ~list
3.
Nothing happens!

A Better option:
1.
Join #eclipse
2.
Type ~list
3.
KOS-MOS responds via private msg with list of available commands.
Alternatively, command could be ~commands (or both ~list and ~commands could work).
Note: ~commands is currently mapped to point to the wiki with the promise of a list of commands, except <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=201751> prevents the wiki from being a useful provider of mapped commands.
