Bug 473443 – Base64 classname has to be disambiguated with Java8
In java8 there is a Base64 class and the JSLP provider references Base64 on line 78 of ServiePropertiesAdapter class.
 This was fine in Java7 as it refered to org.eclipse.ecf.util.Base64 unambiguously.
 This reference in the jslp provider should be disambiguated to refer to org.eclipse.ecf.util.Base64 specifically.
