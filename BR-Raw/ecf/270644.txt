Bug 270644 – eclipse hangs on update site test if proxy information is incorrect
Build ID: I20090313-0100
Steps To Reproduce:
I started Eclipse 3.5 M6 within a corporate firewall.
The network connections proxy options were set to native by default.
I created a remote update site to http://download.eclipse.org/tools/buckminster/updates-3.5 (which works fine outside the firewall) and attempted to test the connection
this causes Eclipse to hang.
cancel doesn't seem to do nothing
Will attach thread dumps shortly.
