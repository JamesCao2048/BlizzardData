Bug 211713 – Suggested remoteservices API change: IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.getRemoteServiceReferences should throw InvalidSyntaxException
More information:
In the spirit of other examples from the OSGi space, IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.getRemoteServiceReferences should throw InvalidSyntaxException.
The point is that this method accepts filters as Strings, so the implementation has to create a filter object from the string.
If syntax errors in the filter are masked from the application, it makes them inherently harder to debug because the result of an invalid filter and a non-matching filter are the same.
The Javadoc comment of IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.getRemoteServiceReferences explicitly mentions the possibility of an InvalidSyntaxException but since it is not a RuntimeException, the interface has to state that this exception is possibly thrown.
This problem did not occur with the DSO implementation of remoteservices, since the corresponding IRemoteFilter creation part seems to be unimplemented so far.
(See org.eclipse.ecf.provider.remoteservice.generic.RegistrySharedObject.createRemoteFilterFromString).
