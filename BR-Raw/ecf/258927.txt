Bug 258927 – [Discovery][SLP] byte service properties aren't correctly converted into an octet sequence (Base64)
"Opaque values (i.e.
 binary values) are expressed in radix-64
notation.
 The syntax is:
<opaque-val>    ::=  (<len>:<radix-64-data>)
<len>           ::=  number of bytes of the original data
<radix-64-data> ::=  radix-64 encoding of the original data
<len> is a 16-bit binary number.
 Radix-64 encodes every 3 bytes
of binary data into 4 bytes of ASCII data which is in the range
of characters which are fully printable and transferable by mail.
For a formal definition of the Radix-64 format see RFC 1521 [7],
MIME Part One, Section 5.2 Base64 Content Transfer Encoding, page
21."
org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.jslp.ServicePropertiesAdapter.toProperties() and org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.jslp.ServicePropertiesAdapter.ServicePropertiesAdapter(List) convert byte[] incorrectly.
