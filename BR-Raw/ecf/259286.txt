Bug 259286 – [[core][sharedobject] improve handling of class not found problems
Currently, the reporting of class not found exceptions on shared object deserialization is not good.
One frequent cause of such errors (not exporting the necessary package/class) is now documented here:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF_Pitfalls
When such errors occur, and a class cannot be found, this should be reported more loudly via system.err.
