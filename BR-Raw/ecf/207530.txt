Bug 207530 – [Collab] Cola - Real-Time Shared Editor does not support multi-character operations
Cola is operating on single character insertions and deletions as atomic modification units.
It does not support the insertion of multiple characters (via the clipboard) at once.
The same applies to other multi-character operations such as deletion of text > single character by for instance marking a section of text and hitting "Delete/Backspace".
If an editing session participant executes an unsupported modification of this kind on her/his local document, remote sites discard the modification upon receipt - essentially resulting in documents being out-of-sync.
Cola should be extended/adapted to allow for insertions and deletions of texts greater than a single character in length.
