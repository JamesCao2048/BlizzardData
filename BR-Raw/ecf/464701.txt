Bug 464701 – [Discovery][Zookeeper] Auto reconnect issue
In our client-server OSGI application we are using ECF Zoodiscovery provider (v.1.0.100) for remote services discovery.
When testing the application resiliency, we noticed that when unplugging/plugging back the network cable, the client in some cases doesnâ€™t get back remote OSGI services from the server.
I started debugging this use case and found out that in case of read timeout both Zookeeper internally and Zoodiscovery try reconnecting simultaneously:
1) Zookeeper internally:
in ClientCnxn.SendThread.run() in case of SessionTimeoutException it closes socket connection in cleanup(), sends the disconnect event to watchers and reconnects in startConnect().
2) Zoodiscovery:
ReadRoot.process receives the disconnect event from Zookeeper and invokes connect() which closes the existing Zookeeper connection and creates a new one.
This results in a connect-disconnect-connect operation (since Zoodiscovery closes the just reopened by Zookeeper connection and creates a new one) instead of just connect and an inconsistent client state â€“ connection finally gets re-established, but the client doesnâ€™t ask the server for the remote services.
I think that Zoodiscovery should not trigger disconnect/connect in cases when Zookeeper does it on his own.
