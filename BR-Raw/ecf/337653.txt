Bug 337653 – [remoteserviceadmin][discovery] add support for allowLoopbackReference and endpointListenerScope system properties
In the old implementation of remote services, we have support for a System property:  org.eclipse.ecf.osgi.services.discovery.allowLoopbackReference
which if true would allow remote services to be imported in local framework.
To aid in the use of r-osgi in particular, it would be useful to have support for this system property in the remote service admin implementation.
Also, it would be useful to introduce another system property:
org.eclipse.ecf.osgi.services.discovery.endpointListenerScope
To allow the remote service admin endpoint listener scope (for the BasicTopologyManger) to be customized arbitrarily.
