Bug 170510 – [UI] No notifications are provided when IRC operators leaves the channel
1.
Join a new channel so you become an operator.
2.
Join the same channel on a different account using the org.eclipse.ecf.ui/org.eclipse.ecf.example.collab setup.
3.
Have your first account leave the channel with /part.
4.
No text messages are displayed in the channel's window to indicate that that user has left the channel.
