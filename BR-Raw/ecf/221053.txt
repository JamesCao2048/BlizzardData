Bug 221053 – The message from the XMPP Server is not displayed.
I use Openfire 3.4.5 server.
The message from the XMPP Server is not displayed.
On XMPPContainerPresenceHelper.handleMessageEvent(),
fromID is null.
org.jivesoftware.smack.packet.Message
body	"000\n"
error	null
==>	from	"w2k-tw"
packetExtensions	null
packetID	"ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
properties	null
subject	null
thread	null
to	null
type	Message$Type  (ID=1014)
It is because there is no the from field in the form of user@server.
