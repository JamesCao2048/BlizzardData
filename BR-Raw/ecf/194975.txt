Bug 194975 – Method to connect to providers is not obvious
I think I've had at least three people talk to me on IRC, confused over how they can connect to IRC with ECF.
Apparently, the little man icon just don't seem to catch people's eyes for some reason.
Somewhere in our release notes, we need the awe-inspiring red rectangle, to capture the masses' attention.
<nitind> I hear red rounded corner rectangles are all the rage...: http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/community/tutorials/XMLValidation/images/project-properties.png
We may also want to redesign this whole deal so that the little man appears in other places.
Or at least, provide IPCA connections through the MRV as you would kinda expect it to be there.
