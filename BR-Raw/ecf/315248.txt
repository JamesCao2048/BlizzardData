Bug 315248 – [Discovery] [ZooDiscovery] GUID contains characters to confuse Zookeeper nodes buildup
Zookeeper is using a node path in this form 'root/child/grandchild'.
We have used the ECF GUID class to get an unique node.
However, we have discovered (haha) that the GUID sometimes contains slashes.
This is not according to the Zookeeper specs and will result in services not being published.
We have a patch.
