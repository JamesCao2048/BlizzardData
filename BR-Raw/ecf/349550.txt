Bug 349550 – R-OSGi needs to generate URLs with full host name, not just name
The R-OSGi provider generates URLs like:
r-osgi://host:9280#1_2.3.4
However, it really should use the canonical host name e.g.
r-osgi://host.example.com:9280#1_2.3.4
since 'host' may not be resolvable by other machines on different DNS subdomain setups.
