Bug 254872 – Convert org.eclipse.ecf.core.identity.IDCreateException into RuntimeException
As discussed offline, org.eclipse.ecf.core.identity.IDCreateException may not inherit from org.eclipse.ecf.core.util.ECFException, but from a (TODO) ECFRuntimeException.
On the other hand, the checked Exception org.osgi.framework.InvalidSyntaxException might convince us to keep it as it is.
