- The provided prototype is functional, and it does two major tasks: (1) reformulates a bug report's content, and (2) localizes the bugs and reports the localization performances. 
- README provides a careful documentation of all the artifacts included.
- README provides an overview of what the tool does, and enlists a set of clear instructions to run/execute the tool.
- All the external dependencies, and associated data including pre-processing tools are provided.
- The artifacts are made publicly available using a DOI.
- The tool can be easily employed for validating any future tools on bug localization. 
- Raw version of our results and queries are provided for the direct verification 
  of a major section of our published results.
